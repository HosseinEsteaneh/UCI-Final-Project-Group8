Wife and I enjoyed every minute of it without EVER feeling bored or it being slow. Take a chance and I\\'m sure you\\'ll enjoy it. Very happy with the time well spent.',\n",
       " 'Glad I watched it. Appreciate that Tom Hanks did it.\\n\\nRaised my curiosity about the history of America after the civil war. As well, it makes sense if this was the start of Broadcast Journalism.\\n\\nThe human path of recovery and belonging presented several perspectives worth contemplation.',\n",
       " 'Heartwarming movie! I did get very distracted by the incorrect geography. Wish they would have actually filmed in Texas or at least tried to make the locations more accurate.',\n",
       " 'Another Netflix hit. Helena Zengel is a star. Fantastic performance. She deserves an Oscar.',\n",
       " \"News of the World is co-written and directed by Paul Greengrass, and based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Paulette Jiles. Since it got announced that Tom Hanks was gonna star in this film that's how long I've looked forward to it. Paul Greengrass have showed multiple of times with films like the Bourne trilogy and Captain Phillips that he's a great filmmaker, seeing him tackle the western genre made me excited and he didn't disappoint. The story is set in 1870 and follows a Civil War veteran who must return a young girl who was taken in by Native Americans as an infant to her last remaining family.\\n\\nTom Hanks plays Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd and Helena Zengel plays Johanna Leonberger/Cicada. Their performances are one of the film's highlights, they are very good and realistic. Tom Hanks nails the accent and overall feeling of a person who lived in 1870 whilst Helena Zengel brings a terrific performance and had to learn Kiowa which deserves praise. The supporting cast has for example RayMcKinnon and Elizabeth Marvel, there's of course more actors in the cast but it's mostly just smaller roles as the film is about Captain Jefferson Kidd and Johanna Leonberger, and their journey, their travels.\\n\\nThe director, Paul Greengrass has the visual storytelling on point, using the show don't tell to show off backstory for our protagonists. Overall superb direction. The cinematography is breathtaking, such a nicely shot movie. There's not much more to say other than it deserves a nomination for best cinematography. The musical score was done by James Newton Howard, it's one of his best of those I have heard. The soundtrack has so many instruments authentic to the era, both from Native American and regular, mixing them both for a perfect and powerful score that's full with suspense. The sound design is incredible, every single sound in the movie feels so real and it makes it so easy to get immersed.\\n\\nNow this film is far from an action movie but there is gunfights in it, some of the realistic ones I have seen, they nailed the sound and effects. But most importantly, the realistic and brutal ways of gunfights. The whole film is well made, some of the finest piece of cinema I have seen. The whole production design is top notch, you'll see some stunning set pieces and a western worth remembering.\\n\\nNews of the World was named one of the ten best films of 2020 by the National Board of Review, and I agree fully with them. If you're a fan of westerns or just interested in a period film then you'll lost likely enjoy this one, I strongly believe that there's something for everyone in this film. They managed to create a fantastic film filled with incredible acting and memorable set pieces. But I do understand that it isn't for everyone because of the slow pace but I felt it fitted the tone of the film perfectly and how they travel. It gave the writers and director time for character development and for us viewers to really get to know the characters.\",\n",

       " \"I absolutely loved this Movie, it is set in the 1870s when one could still go around from Town to Town to earn a living reading the News to paying Audiences.\\n\\n150 Years later now we can get all the News we want in our Smartphones. I liked very much how they were able to capture what it was like to live back in those Days, where the Town Roads are either Dusty or Muddy.\\n\\nOr when as soon as you step out of Town, it is either the open Plains or creepy Forest Paths which is often filled with danger. It is a pretty effective Western Adventure with nice Storylines about the Kid and the Captain's past.\\n\\nDecades later and Tom Hanks is still hitting the Ball out of the Ballpark in terms of Movie Quality. Helena Zengel was great as the headstrong, semi-wild Kid who was kidnapped by the Indians at a younger age and rescued later.\\n\\nA Must-Watch for me, one of 2021's Best Movies so far.\",\n",

Still in the aftermath after watching it a few hours ago i am sure this is the right one to start with...\\n\\nPlease dont miss this great movie just because you dont like Western, looking beyond the surface this movie is so much more.\\n\\nIt gives us a pinching look at what we did to the Native Americans (again, not as intense as Kevin Costner did but but still enough) while taking us on a heartbreaking journey with very intense moments.\\n\\nIf anybody doesn't have teary eyes in the end, seriously, go see a doctor!\\n\\nTom Hanks proves again why he is one of the finest actors out there and Helena Zengel pretty much does the same (so great to see another fellow German on the big screen and delivering such a knock-off performance)...writing this alone gives me goosebumps again!\\n\\nFantastic Score, Cinematography breathtaking, Colours and Lighting remarkably good!\\n\\nIt would be so well deserved seeing this picture getting a nod at the Globes and the Oscars, fingers crossed!\\n\\nEven if you dont like it, you still watched a great movie (you just don't realize it yet :) )\",\n",

I found this beautiful.\\n\\nIt was never dull, it was never slow. Every scene and shot, captured my full attention.\\n\\nThe story or the action are not always what define a great movie.

Tom Hanks is an excellent actor.\\n\\nThe storyline was fine. It didn't bother me that I may have seen some of the elements before. Captain Kidd and Johanna made a believable pair.\\n\\nThe perils were accurate for a western. The resolution was fine and welcomed.\\n\\nMy only two complaints would be the language and the geography. I am not entertained by profanity. It is not a part of my daily life, and it serves as an annoying speed bump. It appears that some scriptwriters can't communicate without using it over and over.\\n\\nAdditionally, the scenery was totally inaccurate for the areas of Texas they were supposed to be in. I guess this would not be a big problem for the public at large, but it was somewhat jarring to me, having lived in those areas.\",\n",

       " \"Just a few thoughts to share for this movie since I think most people saw Tom Hanks in the cast and have already watched it. While Hanks is always good, and we sort of expect him to be good, his co-star, who played the young girl 'Johanna' - was the real star, strictly imho. She nailed it. The chemistry between Hanks and the girl develops slowly, but it works. I'm not a big fan of Westerns, but this was a truly good story. And for the first time in a long time, a film actually moved me to tears, but I'll deny it if you ask me tomorrow. Just have a box of tissues nearby; men feel free to use your shirt sleeves. Cut to the chase: Although this film develops steam slowly, exceptional performances by the cast make it a bitter-sweet Western that is definitely worth watching.\",\n",

Helena is on a completely different end of talent spectrum who wields power to hold the movie on her own. Her ' dime..ah' act evoked delight and pain in equal measures. The climax is a heartwarming visual and as Hanks untie Helena tied to a pillar, you will surely untie the Pent-up emotions as your eyes will start welling!

It's a relatively quiet movie with very intense moments, sometimes even without words, what really needs a higher mastery of acting. Therefore acting in this movie is extraordinary and moving. The girl character was well chosen and did a fantastic job. Costumes and characters are really well done. Plus on top of that I really enjoyed the exteriors and interiors, which looked aged and well placed in 1870's time-frame and took the viewers back in time. Only thing was the CGI that can be done better but it was not ruining the overall emotion you can gain from the movie. So if you are looking for a lovely Western movie, you just found it!\",\n",

It manages to succeed in being gritty, heartwarming and meditative at the same time.\\n\\nI quite enjoyed the pacing. It felt like a road trip film with a western touch. The action scenes are clearly a specialty of Greengrass' too, even though this story doesn't require many. The tension and suspense was really effective.\\n\\nHanks was phenomenal (as usual) and I often forgot I was watching a Tom Hanks movie. I thought he was excellently cast in the role of the Captain. I loved the whole concept of him traveling from place to place reading the news to the townspeople.\\n\\nThe score was really great too and felt rather epic, which matched the sweeping panoramas and excellent cinematography.

You may be tempted to detract by thinking \"well, who knows how many takes i it took to get her acing that scene?\" Or perhaps, \"The director must have bused his muttons to get her to look so right for the camera.\" All that could be the stone cold truth, but there\\'s no getting around the fact that she performed like a boss.

If you want fast action you won't like this, but it is quality work there's no doubt about that. Recommended.\",\n",

Amazing acting of Hanks and Helena Zengel, who although still is just a kid, is going to be a huge star as her acting is simply powerful with pure talent.

His way is crossed by a little orphan girl under custody of Union with an order to be placed in an indigenous reserve. She is a white girl that has a double orphan destiny. Her parents were killed by indigenous warriors requesting their land back. Later, her indigenous step-parents would be killed by confederate soldiers from Texas. The captain has a mission: to find a place for this girl whose parents are dead already.

Stories about heroes are important, they move and inspire us, which is why the heroes journey is as old as humankind. If this film says one thing, it's this: stories are important. I agree.

It combines a great narrative with some western movie themes, which we all like - there is a little bit of action, a bit of suspense, some very colorful characters and a deep realistic down to earth atmosphere. This movie actually reminded me of Tarantino's work in westerns, but without pointless carnage. The dialogues are deep, you are really getting to know the characters and their stories. You are even learning some new languages along the way. Regarding the technical aspects in this movie, I liked the sound, ambiance and the scenic stereotypical western shots very much.

Along the way there is an exiting scene where they are being chased by 3 men who want the girl. Tom and the girl go hiding up in the rocks and have a shoot out with the men...I felt badly for the girl and she played the part so well.

I predicted the ending but was glad it turned out the way it did because I found it to be so heartwarming. Definitely reccommended when you get the chance to see it. Tom is good as always.

The great accomplishment of \"News of the World\" is that it could very well have been made in the fifties but is also very actual. It came to my mind \"The Searchers \"and also the final shootout at \"Winchester 73\". And I had a great feeling of satisfaction because just when you think westerns will disappear, something like this shows up. The two main actors, Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel are perfect, great performances.

       " \"Tom Hanks reunites w/his Captain Phillips director, Paul Greengrass (Flight 93/Jason Bourne), in this Western which deals w/a news reader trying to bring a white child (who's family was killed & raised by Indians) back to the only living kin she has after he discovers her initial transport was killed as well. A former Civil War soldier who fought for the South at the expense of his wife (who died of cholera waiting four years for him to come home) now plies his trade as a newspaper reader (presented as a show of sorts to the masses who probably at that time didn't know how to read or were looking for any kind of entertainment) who still commands a modicum of respect & stature even at this stage in his life so when he comes upon the blonde waif, played by Helena Zengel (who calls him Captain, I guess an unintentional refrain from Captain Phillips), he's incapable of not doing the right thing by escorting the girl to a nearby town who tells him the nearest Indian agent is miles away which he reluctantly does & then again when he hits a wall there, he decides to bring the girl all the way to her nearest relations (an aunt) defending against a trio of bandits hoping to steal the girl & a hostile town where mob rule has taken root & the defacto leader wants to use Hanks to his whims (which backfires by the by!). If you've seen enough Westerns (here's my 'hold my beer' moment!), this is isn't exactly new ground but since movie Westerns have gone the way of the dodo, any time a modern filmmaker takes a stab at an oater, it should be welcomed & appreciated (w/selections like Netflix's Godless or even something like Cowboys Vs. Aliens, you won't be disappointed) which Greengrass does exceedingly well here. Also starring Ray McKinnon & Mare Winningham as a couple Hanks leaves Zengel with at the outset, Elizabeth Marvel as another person Hanks has some history with & the current character actor du jour, Bill Camp (last seen in the Netflix hit Queen's Gambit as the janitor who teaches the prodigy about chess) seen here as a hometown friend of Hanks.\",\n",

A little bit like 'The Searchers' and other familiar older westerns but, of course, more sensitively and realistically dealt with than those older movies.

Never thought Hanks would fit in a western but I was wrong - very wrong. This is the perfect western role for Hanks - a mature thoughtful man that has survived and lost a lot, and yet can still find a good cause to pursue. Very realistic movie about how the old west really was - tough and gritty and dangerous - long periods of hard work and boredom, with the occasional high moments of excitement.',\n",

I can honestly say it was great to watch and you should see it if you get the chance. Tom Hanks played a rugged Civil War veteran very well. His character is a man of just wanting to mind his own business. Helena Zengle plays this twice orphaned girl who has no home, but yet the bond between \\'Captain\\' and \\'Johanna\\' is delightful. Helena also did an incredible job with her acting as it depended more on her attitude in the roll than the actual speaking. Visually this film was pleasing. I enjoyed the vibrant colours, the camera angles, shots of the landscape, and the flow between scenes. The story was good. It didn\\'t offer anything too intense. The adversity faced throughout the film was perfectly placed. Because of this, the fluidity of the film was perfect.

       " \"Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks return for the first time since 2013s Captain Phillips, in News of the World Hanks gives a phenomenal performance (no shock there) as former Civil War soldier turned newsreader Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd. Here really shows his paternal side as his life takes a turn when he comes into contact with a lost 10-year-old Kiowa girl, and the two embark on a long journey across Texas facing many dangers along the way. But Hanks isn't the only one to take a turn because behind the camera Greengrass has stepped out of his comfort zone with this, he doesn't usually give us a slow yet an incredibly absorbing drama, in fact quite the opposite he usually gives us tense thrillers, while this may be a step out for him. It's also a step in for him as he seems very much at home, thus making News of the World a success. Granted it does suffer from narrative issues down the road but you can always rely on Hanks pulling out a trick up his sleeve yet again he's an absolute joy to watch and when the action slams into place both Hanks and Greengrass crank up the mayhem. Greengrass delivers again and it might even be safe to say that he should go down this road again, or maybe another genre he hasn't tried, let's hope it stars Hanks again as these two are dynamic together. And it shows. 4/5.\",\n",
       " 'IN A NUTSHELL: There were soooo many movies that came out around Christmas that I just recently found time to watch the newest Tom Hanks film. In case you missed it too, here\\'s the scoop! Universal Pictures bought rights to this melancholy western movie after its original screenplay owner, 20th Century Fox, was closed by the Walt Disney Company. It utilizes the two-time Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks to tell the story of Civil War veteran Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, based on the novel by Paulette Jiles\\' 2016 novel. She actually received the National Book Award nomination for fiction the same year. Before TV news anchors, traveling newsreaders would relay the day\\'s headlines across the country \"for anyone with 10 cents and the time to hear it.\" The touching movie is directed by Paul Greengrass who also co-wrote the film with Luke Davies.\\n\\nTIPS FOR PARENTS: You see a dead, black man hang from a tree. Some unnecessary profanity that would have made the movie more family-friendly without You see a field with a bunch of dead animals. Violence with guns Some German and Kiowa Indian are spoken with subtitles a few times.\\n\\nTHEMES: Family Home The power of healing relationships Choice Letting go of the past and moving forward Loneliness Secrets\\n\\nTHINGS I LIKED: Tom Hanks is an American icon in the film industry. I don\\'t know a single person who doesn\\'t recognize his brilliance. He\\'s such a talented and versatile actor. What\\'s amazing is that this is his very first Western film! Well, that\\'s if you don\\'t count the Sherrif he voices in the Toy Story franchise. He\\'s a master at playing flawed, yet honorable characters. It\\'s a Western movie, but a much different take on one. Director Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks worked together in the powerful movie Captain Phillips. This is the English language debut film for Helena Zengel. She became the youngest to ever win the \"Best Performance by an Actress In a Leading Role\" at the German Film Awards in 2019 for her role in System Crasher. She was born and raised in Berlin and began her career at the ripe old age of five in a music video. movies She has that unique spark of a true star and we\\'re sure to see a lot more of her after this performance. After one look at her audition, director Greengrass said it was the easiest decision he made in the film. It\\'s the first time he has made a movie with a child actor at the heart of it. She plays an orphaned girl who was raised by the Kiowa Indians. When she was interviewed, she said she had never heard of Tom Hanks before. That\\'s surprising because she has great father/daughter chemistry with her older acting buddy. Compelling cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. James Newton Howard\\'s score is a perfect fit for this Western yarn. Believable special effects and scenarios. The silence is even more powerful than the spoken words. The film features dangers both by humans and nature. There is an intriguing social commentary on how we get our news today, the importance of how it\\'s presented, and how eager we are for it.\\n\\nTHINGS I DIDN\\'T LIKE: It\\'s definitely a slow burn. I didn\\'t feel truly engaged until about an hour into the movie. I\\'ve talked with several people who were bored while watching the movie. I definitely enjoyed it more than they did. It has less action and tension we\\'ve ever seen from a Paul Greengrass movie. We\\'re used to having our hearts beat out of our chest with his movies like the Jason Bourne franchise, Green Zone, United 93, etc. so this film felt very restrained. Not much humor to balance out the drama. There are some odd CGI moments. It\\'s very predictable, but the journey was still enjoyable.\\n\\nYou can watch the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel! Subscribe!',\n",

No spoiler here, but as the two first get involved, they cannot communicate verbally - two different languages.

       " 'I\\'m a big fan of Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks, so I was looking forward to this 19th-century Western. Based on the book of the same name, it tells the story of a Civil War veteran, Capt. Kidd (Hanks) who now serves as a news-teller in Texas. He must bring a young girl, Johanna, to her aunt and uncle. The film is skillfully well-made and leisurely paced, as its tone feels almost lyrical. Its western setting is depicted as harsh and realistic, but still unique and powerful. The film\\'s cinematography of 19th-century north Texas is absolutely impeccable. After \"Nomadland,\" it\\'s the best cinematography of the year. From gorgeous wide shots of prairies and canyons and mountains to detailed sets of important towns at the time such as Wichita Falls, the shots look sublime throughout the film.\\n\\nWhile the film\\'s pacing is slow, it never feels too slow by any means. In fact, such leisurely pacing feels appropriate to the more lyrical tone of the film--almost like a more gritty version of a ballad. Even though the film is obviously very tonally different from Greengrass\\' other films, such as the original Bourne trilogy and \"Captain Phillips,\" Greengrass is still able to build up lots of suspense at appropriate times over the course of the film--such as a scene when Capt. Kidd and Johanna must out-maneuver a gang of outlaws, a bumpy and dangerous stagecoach ride, and a desert storm. The emotional core between Kidd and Johanna is very well done, and the performances are very strong. Hanks does a great job showing a range of both charisma and grit in the role, and the young actress who plays Johanna is superb. My only criticism of the film was that the film could have developed Kidd and Johanna better as characters, although the limited dialogue between the two of them (as Johanna does not speak English) may be one of the reasons why character development within the scenes they are both together in can sometimes be a bit limited. Otherwise, this is a gritty yet gorgeous Western made with passion and talent. Gladly recommended. 8/10',\n",
       " 'Greetings from Lithuania.\\n\\nThe first reason I really wanted to watch \"News of the World\" (2020) - a very good new movie with Tom Hanks was a name of Paul Greengrass - this man has made of my favorite movies in the last two decades - you name it. And i wasn\\'t disappointed of \"News of the World\". This was an old fashioned, characters driven western were at the center were characters. This western reminded me sometimes of \"Unforgiven\", Clooney\\'s \"Midnight Sky\" and some other road movie were some world weary person takes sort of father duties he had never had before. Its not an action western, but there were some \"action\" scenes, particularly memorable because of characters and some in genuine ideas - and i will say no more.\\n\\nOverall, \"News of the World\" for sure has a common days agenda as well despite its western setting. But what this movie really was as well is and old fashioned road movie - western and even character study drama. A very solid movie overall.',\n",

Most people have the attention span of a spoon.. take for instance they think hell on wheels is the best show ever seen, even though it's a joke writing wise. This was actually well done. It was a bit odd how he didn't pick up his guns he tossed. And i think the horses disappeared and reappeared in one shot. But me and my family really enjoyed it. Great movie and worth seeing it. Don't listen to the sexist prejudice people in the reviews. Big yikes.. it's 2021 grow up.\",\n",
       " 'Tom Hanks is a 19th century newsman who reads newspaper stories to townsfolk in Texas. On his route of numerous locations, he comes across a young German-born girl who has been living under the care of native Americans who have been slaughtered. He takes it upon himself as her new guardian to escort her across the countryside to safety in the hope of finding her a new home. Along the way, they achieve an expected bond as two lonely souls in a treacherous world of danger of adversity.\\n\\nHanks is great as always, as the film is told from his weary, anguished eyes. But newcomer Helena Zengel steals the film from right underneath him with a mesmerizing performance as a young girl traumatized by personal tragedy, untrusting of the world around her and just beginning to learn her communication. Together, they bring this rugged journey to life. Director Paul Greengrass makes a vivid recreation of 19th century American wilderness, a land of difficult terrain and occasionally bitter climate. Through it all, it becomes a battle for survival for both the old man and the child he is protecting. An old school tale of American grit, this one is expertly crafted and highly recommended.',\n",

       " 'IN BRIEF: Fine direction and an understated performance by Mr. Hanks elevates this familiar western tale and its conventional storytelling.\\n\\nJIM\\'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Moviegoing has always been an escape from the news of our world and News of the World, a highly entertaining western tale by Paul Greengrass, is a fine respite that makes its presence known. The film definitely has a \"been there, done that\" vibe as it follows a predictable road trip through glorious American panoramas in very uncertain times. The story takes place in 1870, but the parallels from then and now are strikingly similar with today\\'s contemporary issues of racial hatred, a dreaded disease debilitating the country, the still pressing issue of real vs. fake news, and a polarized nation unable to come together. Subtle, surprisingly yes, but revisionist, absolutely also. To its credit, the film avoids preachy sermonizing as it concentrates on its interesting characters and their misfortunes.\\n\\nSet in the post Civil War Texas badlands, former Confederate officer Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Tom Hanks) travels the country sharing news stories at ten cents a read. His profitable form of stage entertainment, a traveling one-man show-and-tell, allows him to encounter a cross-section of America strife. One day between engagements, he discovers an orphaned white girl named Joanna (Helena Zengel) dressed in Native American garb and only speaking the Kiowa language. He decides to take her back to the safety of her family and inherits the role of her temporary guardian. Their trek together and their eventual bonding is the main scenario in this mediative tale of kinship.\\n\\nThe screenplay by Lucas Davies and the director is quite formulaic as the lonesome twosome run into many obstacles along the way (outlaws, profiteers, natural disasters), but the dialog is literate and insightful, even if the plot literally moves from one peril to the next. But the film is is so beautifully made and a worthy throwback to its Western genre. Mr. Greengrass tells his tale with vigor and style by allowing his characters and their relationships to build gradually. The production values are top-notch with Dariusz Wolski\\'s sweeping photography and James Newton Howard\\'s lyrical music score contributing to the film\\'s sense of grandeur. At the midway point, there is the film\\'s major set piece, a thrilling shoot-out in the Texan foothills, extremely well edited by William Goldenburg. This memorable sequence is wonderfully staged and brimming with tension, though nothing else in the movie attains that accomplished level of excitement.\\n\\nOne of the foremost reasons for the film\\'s success is the central casting of Mr. Hanks as our protagonist. The actor is thoroughly convincing and creates an indelible character of a descent man dealing with his own internal hardships and still trying to move forward. His nuanced portrayal is so skillfully performed that it is easy to overlook its overall impact. As his charge, Ms Zengel gives a totally natural performance. She may not be a young Natalie Wood circa The Searchers in her almost identical role, but Ms. Zengel is far more compelling and does not pander for moviegoers\\' sympathies. Solid support in minor roles comes from stalwart actors that include Mare Winningham, Elizabeth Marvel, Bill Camp, and Ray McKinnon.\\n\\nNews of the World is a solid Western trope that may be too conventional in its storytelling, but it is nevertheless a rousing good time with Mr.Hanks and company. Saddle up, partner! (GRADE: B)',\n",
       " \"It may not be as fast-paced as the usual Paul Greengrass thriller, but 'News of the World' is still a gripping adventure, built around characters that audiences will care about. It is a robust, beautifully shot drama, and while little unexpected transpires, the characters are so richly drawn and their travels so wonderfully realized. Tom Hanks is as expected, a warm and welcome presence that holds the whole film together. His co-star, Helena Zengel, is amazingly good. Their organic chemistry is the heart of 'News of the World.'\",\n",

       " \"News of the World is an emotional western drama set only just after the conclusion of the devastating Civil War. Veteran Captain Kidd has lost his wife to a disease while being at the front line. He tries to escape his grim past by traveling through the country and reading newspapers to citizens in order to inspire change and hope. One day, he comes across a carriage that has been knocked over. The driver has been brutally murdered and the only survivor is a young girl who doesn't speak English. Captain Kidd discovers that her name is Johanna and that she got kidnapped by the Kiowa as a child when they murdered her entire family. She has spent most of her childhood with the Kiowa and her identity is much closer to Native American culture than to her German origins. Captain Kidd plans on bringing her to her aunt, uncle and cousins but the two protagonists have to travel through the entire state of Texas for about six weeks to get there. On their challenging journey, they come across human traffickers and radical militia and must face carriage accidents and sandstorms.\\n\\nThis wonderful western convinces on numerous levels. First of all, the characters are truly intriguing with the grieving, kind-hearted and well-mannered captain and the wild, lost and intelligent child. The acting performances by Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel are absolutely outstanding and would certainly deserve Academy Awards nominations. The different segments of the movie are truly intriguing as well as the protagonists come across hateful and helpful characters and face beautiful and dangerous natural phenomenons. The locations have been chosen with care and bring the war beauty of the Wild West to life in an authentic way. The camera work is calm and precise, the sound effects are immersive and intense and the soundtrack underlines the movie's atmosphere perfectly.\\n\\nEven though the movie might have a few minor lengths here and there, News of the World is one of the greatest contemporary westerns in recent memory. The excellent acting performances, profound characters and diversified plot shouldn't only please genre fans but anyone craving for a heartfelt drama with some tense action scenes. This movie hasn't received the attention it deserves due to the pandemic, so make sure to watch it once cinemas in your region are reopening. While Tom Hanks confirms his status as one of the greatest actors of all time, News of the World is also the breakthrough performance for young German actress Helena Zengel who will hopefully be casted for further Hollywood movies instead of wasting her precious talent on sleep-inducing German televison movies.\",\n",

       " '\"News of the World\" is a Western film based on the novel of the same name by Paulette Jiles. Directed by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93, Captain Phillips) and starring Tom Hanks in the lead role, it frequently treads familiar territory in terms of storytelling but makes up for it with its solid acting and directing.\\n\\nIn 1870, Civil War veteran Captain Jefferson Kidd (Tom Hanks) makes a living by travelling throughout various towns in Texas reading the newspapers to local residents at ten cents a head. After one particular evening of keeping a town informed, Kidd discovers an overturned wagon and a young blonde-haired, fair-skinned girl named Johanna (Helena Zengel) seemingly abandoned wearing Native American attire. Upon reporting Johanna to the local authorities, Kidd is told that it will be three months before someone will be able to return her to her surviving family located several miles south and despite his reluctance and her lack of cooperation, decides to take her there himself.\\n\\nI\\'ve been a fan of Westerns for as long as I can remember, with \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" being one of my all time favourite movies and the \"Red Dead Redemption\" games ranking among the best I\\'ve ever played. I suppose it\\'s just the simplicity of these stories mixed with gunslinging action that attracts me to this genre so much. A film like \"News of the World\" certainly isn\\'t groundbreaking in any of these regards, but it successfully gets the job done in the most satisfying way possible. On the surface, the film is littered with predictable Western tropes like shootouts with bandits, the inhospitable hot climate, and the aftermath of the American Civil War still fresh in the minds of many people. Yet, in spite of all of this, the film managed to rise above most of it thanks to a talented lead actor taking the reins and an equally talented director guiding us through the whole experience. If it were any other pairing, a film like this may not have worked at all, likely sinking without a trace among others of this genre, but instead we have an entertaining Western that engages the audience from start to finish in the face of obvious cliches.\\n\\nUnder Paul Greengrass\\'s direction, the film moves along at a surprisingly slower pace than one would expect of a Western like this. Normally that would be frustrating but I felt that it allowed the audience to properly take in and appreciate the atmosphere of the old American West in all its arid glory. The people encountered and the locations camped at became more involving as a result and weren\\'t simply glanced over in favour of moving the story along. Additionally, his choices in cinematography showcase how vast and dangerous the land our two characters must traverse to reach where they are going. Since the film is set in Texas, one of the largest American states by sheer size, it is a firm reminder of how much ground must be covered if the two of them wish to arrive in one piece. All of this made me think of the old saying that it is the journey itself and not the destination that is most important in any adventure and I believe that can definitely be applied here.\\n\\nAs to be expected, Tom Hanks does a great job in the lead role, bringing the usual affable everyman qualities we are accustomed to seeing in virtually all of his performances. Interestingly, this is the first Western character Hanks has played in his career (unless you count Woody from the Toy Story films) and yet he approaches the role so naturally that it may as well be one of many. However, it is young newcomer Helena Zengel who stands out the most as Johanna. I enjoyed her interactions with Hanks\\'s character, even though she barely understands any English, and watching them grow closer as an almost father/daughter pairing felt rewarding as the film progressed. This is also Zengel\\'s first English language film and hopefully it will open the door for her to other similar projects in the near future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while this film doesn\\'t really do anything new, it still felt fresh as ever mainly due to its main star and director. Francis Ford Coppola once said that there aren\\'t any new stories to tell anymore and that our best bet would be to tell one in our own unique way and this film does indeed feel told in a way any Western fan can enjoy and forgive most of its shortcomings. Other films out there could definitely benefit from that approach, though one can only hope their filmmakers will actually follow suit.\\n\\nI rate it 8/10',\n",

Cynthia Parker ended up choosing being Comanche over returning to the Parkers (a prominent Texas family). The character of Johanna in this film does an excellent job of illustrating the cultural no-man's land that capture and adoption created. If you are wondering why this novel was chosen rather than the story of Cynthia Ann Parker?\\n\\nOne, the story of Cynthia Ann Parker has sort of already been done (although not realistically) - The Searchers starring John Wayne. Second, Cynthia Ann Parker chose to remain a Comanche, she didn't return to live in the world of Texans. Third, the people who searched for these children and to return them to their families were often not very reputable individuals.\\n\\nKidnapping and adopting children was common among the Natives of North America, especially the plains tribes. It is possible that their life on horseback contributed to a low birthrate. Children adopted were raised just as if they had been born into the tribe, and some even rose to high status. An example is Quanah Parker (the last war chief of the Comanche) - the son of Cynthia Ann Parker.\\n\\nWhat most impressed me about this film was Helena Zengel's performance as a German child who was kidnapped and adopted by the Kiowa and then recovered 6 years later.\",\n",

       " 'Pound for pound, Tom Hanks is the best actor of this generation. From his big screen debut in SPLASH to his Oscar Nominated turn in BIG to his back-to-back Oscar wins for PHILADELPHIA and FORREST GUMP to more recent works like SULLY and THE POST, Hanks\\' \"everyman goodness\" quality shines through the screen and makes him a screen presence that cannot be ignored.\\n\\nAnd in his latest effort, the Paul Greengrass Directed NEWS OF THE WORLD, Hanks uses every molecule of his screen presence to keep the audience\\'s attention in a slow-paced, moody character study.\\n\\nBased on the novel by Paulette Jiles, NEWS OF THE WORLD takes place in a post-Civil War Texas where a former Confederate Captain makes a living by going from town to town and reading the news to them. A chance encounter with a twice orphaned young girl alters the lives of both of them.\\n\\nWriter/Director Paul Greengrass is most known for quick-cut action films like the BOURNE series or the criminally underrated GREEN ROOM, so he would seem - at first glance - as an unusual choice to adapt and direct this character study, but look further at Greengrass\\' resume and you will find - in films such as UNITED 93 and CAPTAIN PHILLIPS - an ability to tell a story that is driven more by character than by action.\\n\\nAnd this combination of Director and Actor works well for NEWS OF THE WORLD is a languidly paced piece that has a somber mood and look but Greengrass avoids the temptation of lingering on scenes or pictures too long (and there are some wonderful images captured by Greengrass and Cinemotgrapher Darius Wolski) to tell a story of a man who needs to rediscover and remake himself.\\n\\nAnd Hanks is more than equal to the task of bringing the pragmatic, introspective Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd character to life in a way that makes him intriguing and not boring. Hanks ability to show inherent decency in a look or a gesture is the stuff of legends and when he speaks, you listen. Which is good for Hanks is in every scene in this film and his performance needs to strongly capture the audience for this film to work - and he is more than equal to this task - so strong is Hanks in this role that I would not be surprised if there is another Oscar nomination in Tom\\'s near future.\\n\\nNewcomer Helena Zegal is \"just fine\" in the other main role in this film - the young girl that Captain Kidd encounters, Johnna. This young girl is silent and shut down for most of the film and Zegal performs \"shut down and silent\" well. Also along for brief cameo roles of characters that Captain Kidd encounters on his journey is a bevy of wonderfully cast character actors that include Mare Winnigham, Ray McKinnon, Bill Camp and the always interesting to watch Elizabeth Marvel.\\n\\nAs is often the case in these sorts of films, the music/soundtrack becomes a vital part of the story that unfolds and 8 time Oscar nominated composer James Newton Howard (THE PRINCE OF TIDES) is more than up to the task. The music is another character in this film and helps set the mood along the journey.\\n\\nBut make no mistake, this is Hanks\\' film - and he is VERY good in this. Like MIDNIGHT SKY (reviewed last month), this movie will not be for everyone - and many, many folks are going to tell me that they checked this movie out on my recommendation and were bored by it. But...if you click into the mood, motion and energy of what Greengrass is showing, you will be rewarded with an emotionally rich and complex character study.\\n\\nLetter Grade: A-\\n\\n8 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)',\n",

His life and journey is thrown into a wild card and spin while in his Texas travels he meets an innocent and precious young little lady named Johanna(the charming and wonderful Helena Zengel). The two bond and get to know one another.\\n\\nAlong the way this film becomes somewhat of an epic travel journey and adventure like film with the drama of danger as the will to fight for life is ever present for both Capt. Kidd and little Jo(as she has a past connection to the Kiowa people). The story is entertaining as the acting and chemistry of scenes was in top notch form as it shows how travel and journey leads to discovery and new hope as it brings an emotional connection and new life for both of the two central characters.

Tom Hanks delivers another satisfying performance as a Civil War Veteran who reluctantly brings it upon himself to deliver a young girl to distant relatives whom she was separated from. I haven't seen a film with this particular actor in quite some time so it was refreshing and a pleasure to witness him onscreen especially in the western genre (which I have come to favor the most). Sharing the screen is Helena Zengel who truly shines in this film as a 10-year-old named Johanna Leonberger who is unable to speak the English-language. We observe her compelling performance through her facial expressions such as her piercing eyes, and her motions are what provide communication. Separating the barrier for Captain Kidd and the audience. Truth be told, this film is very predictable and formulaic as I was able to accurately determine how this film would come to a close. But the journey was worthwhile as we witness the growing bond between these individuals who have no place to call home and we receive a very heartwarming conclusion to the storyline. I only wish their characters and their relationship would have been fleshed out in order to grow more of an emotional attachment to them. The plot is identical to Leon: The Professional where the main character becomes the protecter of a troubled youth. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski was absolutely gorgeous as our eyes become satiated with delicious sunsets and color grading to represent the bluish tint of night.

       " \"News of the World follows wild west Newsman Captain Kidd as he travels from town to town, delivering the news to remote townsfolk across southern Texas. After one particular reading, he stumbles across a ransacked wagon carrying a young orphaned girl, and finds himself put in charge of getting her to her aunt and uncle. This is fundamentally a road movie, as we follow Kidd and Johanna on their journey from town to town, meeting an eclectic array of locals, and finding themselves in all kinds of trouble.\\n\\nThis is a fairly light movie though. There's nothing here to particularly challenge the viewer. There's no big twist, no deep subtext to decipher, nothing particularly gritty worth sticking your teeth into. It has its emotional moments, but they're reigned in to keep focus on the relationship between Kidd and Johanna, and there's moments of tension and suspense, but ultimately nothing particularly bad ends up happening to either character (or at least nothing too bad after the movie starts). Johanna's upbringing is one full of tragedy, losing her blood family in a brutal attack on their homestead, which she later visits to see looted and full of blood smeared over the walls. She was then taken in by Kiowa natives, learned their language and drenched in their culture, but she was left as the only survivor of her tribe after an attack by the local colonialists. Kidd on the other hand hasn't seen his wife in over five years, since he left for the war and then started travelling to read the news. He left his life behind and refuses to return for fear of what he might find there, but just like Johanna goes back to her family's homestead, Kidd too goes back to San Antonio to put his demons to rest.\\n\\nThe closest this movie gets to an underlying theme and message is that of the nature of stories, and the news in particular. Kidd makes it his life's work to ensure the hard working men and women of America know what's going on in the world around them, even if doesn't directly affect them. He calms down a rowdy rabble upon hearing of president Ulysses S. Grant's intentions to grant black people more rights and freedoms, but also incites a rebellion in a closed-off town ruled by an outlaw dictator by telling them the story of a group of miners who survived a deadly fire against all odds. News of the World gives us a hero in a Western who changes the world with his words and his stories rather than with guns\\n\\nAlthough to be sure he certainly meets troubles that can't be won with words alone, resulting in the movie's few but suspenseful action sequences. A group of ex-soldiers looking to kidnap Johanna besiege Kidd on a hilltop, forcing him to think outside the box to fend them off, while his incited revolt lands him in big trouble with the outlaw leader. While these action setpieces are draped in suspense and tension, the ultimate outcome is never too shocking or plot-changing. Kidd and Johanna manage to get out of both scuffles largely unfazed, which could lead to some complaints of predictability or plot armour, but hey, it's a light and entertaining movie. They don't all need to be narratively challenging.\\n\\nPossibly my favourite aspect of this movie though was the representation of Native Americans. While they're portrayed with respect throughout, Greengrass goes further by depicting them as almost otherworldly, bathed in dust or fog, always traveling from one place to another. They're neither aggressive nor naively innocent, but just people doing their best to survive, at one with nature and the spirits around them. The film also avoids the temptation to return Johanna to a Native American tribe, acknowledging that she's just as much a Native as she is a Colonialist. She's a girl without a family and without a home, and she no longer fits in with either side. But it certainly flirts with who she'll eventually settle with. As a light and unchallenging movie the answer is ultimately obvious, but that doesn't stop it from daggling the possibilities in front of both us and Captain Kidd.\\n\\nThe acting from Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel is fantastic, offering up so much in their performances without words. Every glance and shift in body language says a thousand words between them, overcoming the multiple layers of language and culture barriers between them. As much as this movie is about the power of truth and stories, it's also about the relationship between these two characters, and a large portion of the film's dramatic entertainment comes from seeing that adoration between them flourish.\\n\\nLastly the film looks gorgeous. It has some shaky moments of CGI from time-to-time, but nothing too distracting. However the cinematography offers some breathtaking shots of the local scenery, bathed in ethereal lighting. Particular highlights include dusklit campfires, silhouettes in the dust storm, and Johanna calling out to a travelling tribe of Natives across a raging river in the dead of night. But what the film does really well is creates an immersive atmosphere of 1870s Texas. You're transported back to the western frontier and told to just live in it and its people. It gave me the same feeling playing Red Dead Redemption gave me, just lifted from my 2021 lifestyle and planted fully in another time entirely. It wasn't too gritty and miserable, but it also wasn't too afraid of the darker elements of that life to gloss over them entirely. The danger on the road, or out in uncharted territory, the relative safety of the larger towns, the pervasive lawlessness, but full of people just living their lives.\\n\\nNews of the World is not a remarkable movie by any means. It's movie that will be largely forgotten about as time goes on. It's a safe, light movie made for pure, sentimental entertainment. There's nothing here to challenge the viewer, nor does it attempt anything particularly new. It's pure escapism, watching Tom Hanks be his usual friendly, selfless character delivering news, and bonding with an orphaned girl along the way. It's just a solid good time free of baggage. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.\",\n",

       " '\"News Of the World\" (2020 releae; 118 min.) brings the story of Captain Jefferson Kidd. As the movie opens, the Captain is somewhere in Texas where he is reading from local and national newspapers for a crowd that has paid 10 cents per person. The next day as the Captain is traveling top the next town, he stumbles upon a lynched black man, and a little white girl hiding in the bushes. From official papers, the Captain gathers this is Johanna, who was being trasported back to her family after having been kidnapped by Natives. The Captain tries, and fails, to drop Johanna off at the nearest army point, and in the end he is resigned to take Johanna to her family 400 miles away... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would s;poil your viewing experience, you\\'ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\\n\\nCouple of comments: this is the latest from director Paul Greengrass (best known for various Bourne films). Here he reunites with Tom Hanks (folllowing 2013\\'s \"Captain Phillips\") to bring what in essence is a western road movie set not long after the conlcusion of the Civil War, let\\'s just call it the 1870s. This is the big screen adaptation of the book of the same name by Paulette Jiles. I haven\\'t read the book and hence cannot comment on how close the movie sticks to the book. What I can say is that this is a very comfortable, if not predictable, western road movie. I mean, there really isn\\'t a single surprise or plot twist that had me thinking \"wow, I don\\'t see that one coming!\". That is not to say that this is a \\'bad\\' movie. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit, none more so than the lead performance from Tom Hanks, who is in virtually every single frame of the movie. I am going to go on record already that Hanks will get a Best Actor Oscar nomination, and in fact he may even win it. It blows the mind that 2020 marks 40 years of Tom Hanks on the big screen (his 1980 debut? \"He Knows You\\'re Alone\"). What better way than to get a star vehicle like \"News of the World\" provides.\\n\\n\"News of the World\" premiered on Christmas Day in a limited theater run (the movie shifts to Netflix in mid-January). The New Year\\'s Eve screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 15 people, which is peanuts in \\'normal\\' times, but is about the largest theater crowd I\\'ve seen since I started going back to the movies in early September for \"Tenet\"). If you love a decent if somewhat predictable western, or you are simply a fan of Tom Hanks, I\\'d readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.',\n",

There's even a role for Bruce Dern essayed by Michael Angelo Covino. I admired the way that Paul Greengrass's direction allowed character to be revealed gradually, and Dariusz Wolski's camerawork, always ugly, always fascinating, a world of brown dust.

It\\'s not nearly as memorable or notable as Josh Baskins from \"Big\" or Woody from \"Toy Story\" but he always brings a certain charm to each movie he\\'s in.

Especially the still unknown German actress, who plays a girl of German descent who grew up among the Kiowa, will snatch up big roles, I assume.

       " \"Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks have followed up their 2013 box-office hit Captain Phillips with another collaboration. In News of the World, Hanks plays a captain for the seventh time in his career, this time in a wild western. In the aftermath of the Civil War, he is a war veteran in charge of bringing the news to the people. On his journey across Texas, he meets a left-behind orphan from the Kiowa tribe and makes it his mission to provide her with a safe living. In the process, the two build a special relationship.\\n\\nTom Hanks is, as always, a banker in the lead role of Captain Jefferson Klyde Kidd. It is the down-to-earth and empathetic nature that his characters often have about them. Hanks gives them the final touch with his great charisma and warm-heartedness. Even though in this case there is nothing wrong with his performance, one has the feeling that Hanks only deliberately chooses such characters. It would be exciting to see him slip into other roles once again. In the end, one even has the feeling that he could have got that bit more out of the character Jefferson Klyde Kidd. Helena Zengel does a great job for her young age as the Indian girl Johanna. Again, the role is quite similar to the one in Systemcrasher, the film that brought Zengel international fame. She is taciturn and once she opens up, she is either quick-tempered or emotionally confused. The chemistry between the two characters is ultimately what makes the film. It works flawlessly and shines especially when they teach each other words in their native languages. They build a father-daughter relationship with each other that you buy over the full length.\\n\\nBasically, News of the World is a solid film that does justice to the Western genre. The plot contains much that we have already seen to excess, but gains its own appeal through the chemistry of the two leads and an exciting shootout scene towards the middle of the film. Greengrass must hope, however, that viewers are still with him at all up to that point. Because the first 30-40 minutes are extremely slow and drag on. Westerns are often built up rather leisurely, but here they have taken too much time with the build-up of tension. With the aforementioned shootout scene, the film acquires more depth, which is reflected in the dialogues between the protagonists, beautiful images of the desert landscape and a very smooth accompanying score. The ending gets under the skin a lot on the one hand, but is too predictable on the other. News of the World is generally not a film that goes for surprising twists. It's a rather semi-brutal western, with decent performances and good technical skills - but that's all it is.\",\n",

However, the long journey soon turns into a fight for survival as the travelling companions encounter danger at every turn -- both human and natural\". So does this movie manage to achieve its goal or fall into the empty desert?\\n\\nThe biggest praise has got to go to Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel performance of the main duos. Tom Hanks gives a subtle weariness and melancholy to his character while still containing compassion that feels genuine. Helena is a child actor so there was some scepticism from me but she delivers with some emotional and even heart-warming performances. The chemistry between the two actors is evident which is why it was such an enormous pleasure to watch both of them. Watching the relationship between these two characters develop from just strangers to that of a family is touching. The scenes where it is just both of them are some of the most enjoyable scenes in the movie and this is thanks to the strong performance from both of them. The supporting cast is really good as well and deliver an effective performance for their representative characters.\\n\\nThe movie contains some great cinematography that makes the movie aesthetically striking and gorgeous visually. This is quite a feat considering that a majority of the movie is set in set in some empty fields but the cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski, pulls it off. It is also complemented by great set and costume design that looks authentic and pulls you into the era the movie is set in. The music score by James Newton Howard is also really strong and is effective in representing the scenes. There are some action scenes in the movie and they are very tense with no shaky cam that is seen from the Bourne movies. For the most part, it is a character-driven story but the action scenes are really good when they occur.\\n\\nHowever, the story is very predictable and even cliche. There is not a lot of originality in this movie and the story is pretty much a beat for a beat tale that has been told so many times before. You can probably guess what is going to happen for the majority of this movie. The heartwarming scenes while done effectively are also things that have been done in previous movies or games. You will see these scenes and feel like you seen them before. There are also some pacing issues with this movie as it can slow at times near the beginning and near the end. Some scenes didn\\'t add much and could have been cut to improve the pacing.\\n\\nOverall, the movie may be very familiar but it is entertaining nonetheless. Thanks to the strong performances and the visually pleasing design of the movie, it is still able to keep you glued to watching it. Under all of its layer, there is a lovely drama that conveys a meaningful message which honestly might be the news the world needs right now.',\n",
       " 'The presence of T.Hanks gives any film an injection of credibility and this is no exception. Good performances from the two lead roles, tremendous photography and locations, and a worthy storyline make this a highly enjoyable watch without setting the world alight.

       " \"No, not the long-extinct British tabloid closed down for hacking celebrity answering machines, but a rather fine western staring everyone's favourite nice guy, Tom Hanks. Here, he travels across a believably authentic setting of 1870's America to deliver a long-lost girl to her only surviving relatives: the trouble is, she was taken by Indians when her family was slaughtered and only speaks their language after spending years in their company. This, as you can imagine, creates some problems in communications along the way...\\n\\nTom Hanks is great in his role as the child's sole protector, who has a murky past of his own... but what did you expect? He kinda has a well-earned reputation for top performances. The real revelation is playing the young lady, who despite hardly uttering a word in English says so much with expressions and gestures alone in an incredibly emotional tour-de-force. If she isn't nominated for an Oscar later this year, let's just say there better be some pretty strong competition.\\n\\nDon't go in expecting anything very gritty... aside from a couple of tense shootouts, this is strictly a tale of two aspiring outcasts who find each other and bond during a long journey in the Wild West. Which is fine, as anyone expecting something along the lines of a C Eastwood epic needs to check their expectations at the door. Just sit back, relax and lose yourself in a genuinely moving and captivating flick.\\n\\nDoesn't sound too hard, does it? 7/10\",\n",

       " 'Greetings again from the darkness. Even in the midst of a pandemic, December is Oscar-qualifying time. And that means we get Tom Hanks\\' latest movie. This time out, the two-time Oscar winner reunites with his CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013) director Paul Greengrass (three \"Bourne\" movies, and Oscar nominated for UNITED 93, 2006) for Hanks\\' first ride into the western genre. Luke Davies (Oscar nominated for LION, 2016) adapted the screenplay from Paulette Jiles\\' 2016 novel.\\n\\nThe beloved Mr. Hanks stars as Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd. We know his full name because he proudly announces it at each stop of his news-reading route. That\\'s right, even in 1870, which is before television and radio and internet, a person could earn a living reading the news. OK, so it wasn\\'t the millions that national anchors make these days, as he was dependent on the audience dropping a coin or two in the tin cup. For this they were treated to Captain Kidd\\'s robust presentation of news and events (and some gossip) from around the nation ... straight from the news clippings he collected during his travels.\\n\\nOn the trail one day, Captain Kidd comes across a horrific scene of violence, and a 10 year old girl with a shock of blonde hair. She only speaks Kiowa, but the found paperwork lists her name as Johanna (the first American film for Helena Zengel). It turns out, tragic events in her family\\'s home many years earlier left Johanna being raised by the Kiowa Indians. Captain Kidd is now on a mission to return her to her surviving relatives (an aunt and uncle), but there are at least three obstacles to his plan: it\\'s a rigorous trip of about 400 miles, the girl doesn\\'t want to go, and there remains much tension in the split among the post-war citizenry. So what we have here is a western road trip (trail ride) that\\'s a blend of TRUE GRIT (minus the witty banter) and THE SEARCHERS.\\n\\nIt should be noted that Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd has served in three wars, including the recently concluded Civil War. He may make his living wearing bifocals and reading newspapers, but Kidd is no nerd. He handles pressure quite naturally, as we witness in chase scene up a rocky hill. The resulting shootout not only creates the first bond between Kidd and Johanna, but also flashes the Captain\\'s calming influence. This is a soulful and principled Tom Hanks (as usual), but this time he\\'s riding a horse and his furrowed brow is working overtime.\\n\\nThe trip to Johanna\\'s home coincidentally takes Kidd very close to where he once lived - a place that holds his best and worst memories. As viewers we see what Captain Kidd and Johanna don\\'t. They are both headed back to a past they no longer belong to. Along the way, the two travelers cross paths with characters played by Elizabeth Marvel, Ray McKinnon, Mare Winningham, and the always great Bill Camp. There is nothing rushed about the story or these people. Fans of director Greengrass will be surprised to find an absence of his trademark rapid-cut action sequences, but he has delivered a sweeping epic with superb cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise), expert editing (Oscar winner William Goldenberg, ARGO), and a terrific score (8-time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard). Mr. Hanks delivers yet another stellar performance (of course), and young Ms. Zengel\\'s assured performance likely means we will be treated to her work for years to come. It\\'s a quasi-western period piece that is plenty interesting to watch, yet lacks the memorable moments to justify multiple watches or a place among the genre\\'s best. Opens December 25, 2020',\n",
       " 'This is so totally familiar and you know pretty much where it\\'s headed. But that\\'s a comfort sometimes of such movies like these, and the pleasure is how it\\'s done - and Tom Hanks as Captain Kidd when he goes back to that town he\\'s from and sees his friend and most especially visits his wife\\'s grave is a solid reminder why he can so powerfully channel deep reservoirs of feeling (and in a different key than in his last time with Greengrass at the end of Captain Phillips, but no less true) - and in the details of how this man and young girl survive in the elements of the deserts of Texas. And it\\'s one of the only Westerns I can think of that makes paramount the idea of education and communication what binds us and strengthens human connection. News of the World is a comforting blanket of a movie, and nice to experience (if you can) in a theater.\\n\\nI\\'ll be a corny pile of stuff for a second (maybe it\\'s also from doing driving instruction the past several months and having to learn how to speak with Spanish language students), but I think discovery and deepening understanding is what will make us last as a civilization. And if there\\'s any real \"villain\" in this movie it\\'s anti-intellectualism (also captivating given the genre), and the concept of people who are others as their proprerty. We get that with the fifteen minutes this becomes the most conventional part, though still thrilling and well shot and edited by Greengrass and company (and thank god he\\'s calmed down on the hand-held) as Not Casey Affleck (seriously the dude sounds just like him) and his gang try to take the girl by force, and with that one Would-be Badass-But-Really-Loser in that town who would shoot you dead for not reading his own propaganda.\\n\\nAnd, again, a lot of this rests on Hanks and his underrated ability to do so much with a look, or a series of looks. And Zengel gives as good as he does.',\n",
       " \"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning\\n\\nCaptain Kidd (Tom Hanks) is a civil war veteran, scarred and haunted by the events that went on. He now travels from town to town, relaying world events to rapturous audiences who lap up his oratory style. However, things take an unexpected turn when he discovers Johanna (Helena Zengel) a young girl hiding in his carriage, who was abducted by Indians. Kidd makes it his mission to reunite Johanna with her parents, and, on the way, is forced to come to terms with his own demons.\\n\\nTo a British audience, at least, at first glance the title News of the World, promised a scintillating glance into the goings on at the now defunct trashy tabloid and its eventual well earned downfall. Given Paul Greengrass's close up, realist style, that might have felt more like his natural habitat, as the outback setting at first glance doesn't feel like fitting terrain in this second collaboration with Tom Hanks after 2013's Captain Phillips, but it gradually manages to build in to something rewarding.\\n\\nIt suffers from a dull opening, meandering and not really holding your attention in the right way, and requires your patience to stick with it, but it slowly develops in to something more engaging, forming the right sense of atmosphere and mood, and manages to draw you in. Hanks is reliably commanding in a role like this which he always does so well, and his young co star Zengel is also impressive as a near mute girl whose trust Kidd has to wean. Taking up most of the film's screen time together, they thankfully create an endearing bond.\\n\\nIt struggles to find its way at first but, like it's two protagonists, eventually manages to find its way and work with its charge. ***\",\n",

You can see the ending coming from a mile off. I just don't know if this was a story that needed to be told.\\n\\nThe script was pretty beige to me too. It wasn't gripping. It wasn't really passionate either. It just felt like a movie script from a western from 2006 that we have all forgot and you may have rented from blockbuster once but you don't really remember it. It just wasn't fresh.\\n\\nI do think the set pieces were pretty good. They looked really nice and in turn provided some lovely shots. I didn't love the colour of this film. It was very muted. I get that it was a western but it just looked really grey and washed out. Maybe this was a choice i just didn't love it.\\n\\nThe acting was pretty good especially from the two leads. Some of the other acting was a bit over the top and out of place. Some of the antagonists seemed like pantomime villains and i also think when they were on screen the script also sagged.

Hanks never disappoints, portraying the loneliness of his character almost with too much routine, and child actress Helena Zengel is very promising. But the collection of genre stereotypes here, the clichees of the villains, the shooting sequences, crossing a desert running out of water, the traumas of post civil war (with some references to the divided nation of today) really doesn't do an exceptional movie for me, but just an average one, giving me the feeling I had seen all of this a hundred times before.\",\n",

Along the way he finds a young girl and agrees to take her to her aunt and uncle.\\n\\nThis is a story that we've seen being played out countless times in the past. It is very predictable and goes down paths that are very familiar. What I really did like about the film was its presentation. This film is a western and Paul Greengrass did a terrific job conveying that to us. The production design, costumes and cinematography make this one of Greengrass's most visually striking films. The lighting too was utilised well which is one of my favourite parts of westerns. The score was also beautiful and brought a lot of atmosphere to the film's world. In terms of its technical aspects, News of the World does a spectacular job creating the western world and breathing life into it. There is one particular shootout scene which has its tense moments but this is one of Greengrass's more sombre and slower films so the lack of action may leave some people restless.\\n\\nThe heart and soul of the film really come from the two lead performances. Tom Hanks is excellent as usual. The energy and charisma he brings to the character when he's reading the news makes him so likeable and even the subtleties he brings to his performance paves the way for the film's more emotional moments that make you truly care about him. Helena Zengel does deliver a surprisingly great performance. At first I wasn't so sure but later on she improved and made me feel more attached to her. I'm hoping to see her in more films in the future.\\n\\nAll in all, News of the World is a decent western.

       " \"I did enjoy watching this film on Amazon Prime's early release because Tom Hanks was excellent. But it's hard to watch how horrible the people were depicted in the post Civil War Texas. You have a lynching. You have greedy capitalists who destroy the buffalo and abuse their workers. You have evil men at every turn down the road. You have a little girl who just wants to go back to her Indian kidnappers because she likes being an Indian. Several times, I felt like the best thing for her would be to grant her wish to return to them instead of subjecting her to the American settlers. The little girl describes how everything is connected in nature in a big circle of life, while Tom Hanks says that Americans just go in a straight line and look ahead. The movie infers that there is no time to appreciate nature for the settlers. One character even says that there is no time for stories. He needs to focus on working the fields.\\n\\nThis is not a Clint Eastwood film like Unforgiven where I found myself rooting for the most evil man in the West to kill Little Bill. The film hints that Tom Hanks' character may not be a great guy, but I never saw proof of this. I just saw someone who did his duty during the war. This is more of a story of how horrid people of Texas treated each other and the native population. It shows the resentment of the townsfolk for the Northern soldiers and the Northern President after the war ended. It was interesting how the army took away the Texans' guns and only allowed them buck shot weapons. It's a story of how the natural resources were abused with an awful scene showing an endless field of skinned buffalos.\\n\\nTom Hanks is very believable as an aging man just scraping out a simple living reading the news. I thought the film was shot with a gritty reality in mind. The gun fight scenes did remind me a bit of Unforgiven in the way that it's not like Hollywood depicts when it's real people fighting for their lives. It showed us a dangerous road and an unforgiving terrain. It was worth watching, but it's a very tough message to stomach even if that's the reality of those times.\",\n",

In this film, which could almost be labelled a road trip he is a seasoned old war veteran delivering news of the world to the pioneers of the west. These scenes are some of the most interesting in the film. But his travels round the state of Texas are mostly filled with events of the sort we are all too familiar with, in the western genre. You know the sort of thing,,, gun battles, double dealing, there is even a dust storm thrown in for good measure. I don't think Hanks has ever been in a western before, not that it matters because the real richness of this story comes from the relationship between him and a homeless little girl. The film's opening sequence sets the scene: he inadvertently teams up with a homeless little girl who has witnessed a horrifying event. She is traumatized and sticks to him like glue. Being only ten years old, and him being a kind man of honour, they team up and find solace in each other's company. You can of course see the ending coming in this particular story and their relationship, interesting though it is, somehow never fizzes into vibrant life. The direction is slow paced, and the Texas scenery doesn't enhance the story as much as one would like. I found myself wondering what John Ford would have done with it. The pace would have been much quicker, and the dialogue would have made you bristle to listen to every word. It's not a bad film by any means, perhaps one of the main problems is that the little girl, Johannna, steals every scene from Hanks, and audiences are not used to that. I could not help but compare it with True Grit, which had a similar theme and was filled with compelling characters and a story that bowled along at a quicker pace.

       " 'An American Civil War veteran (Tom Hanks) accepts the mission to take a girl, abducted by the Kiowa tribe, to her biological family.\\n\\nA western with nothing new or risky. Paul Greengrass (Captain Phillips and the Jason Bourne saga) is capable of more and better, but he preferred to play it safe this time, resulting in a film that is too linear and predictable.\\n\\nThe story isn\\'t exciting, even with good action scenes in between, but lacks in depth.\\n\\nTom Hanks is always an asset, I don\\'t remember any role by him that disappointed me.\\n\\nThe young Helena Zengel does a nice job too, it\\'s her first \"major\" role.\\n\\nI found the cinematography interesting, despite being one of the elements that is criticize the most about the film, as it follows the traditional old school western vibe, which I like.',\n",

       " 'An interesting story bogged down by repetitiveness. Tom Hanks is still great as always. He always puts a lot into each of his roles that makes each of his characters stand out from one another with this one being a reluctant father figure who chooses to help those in need. The direction by Paul Greengrass is great. I haven\\'t seen much of his work but I\\'m interested in seeing what else he can do besides this and Captain Philips. Both of which Tom Hanks starred in. Helena Zengel is good at points and weak in others so I can\\'t praise her performance nor can I bash it. This has an interesting concept of a Civil War Captain who travels from town to town reading the news to people stepping outside of his comfort zone to help someone in need. I think this film did a great job at showing the unrest in 1880s Texas. The film shows the tension between the people of Texas and the Union forces stationed there. It also does a good job at making you feel for some of the characters especially Hanks\\' character. The cinematography is also great. Greengrass does an incredible job at showing off these great landscapes with each shot feeling a little more different than the last. My big issue with this film comes down to its repetitiveness, pacing, and slow descent into boredom. There is a cool action set piece at the beginning but after that point, the film starts to throw similar situations of peril one after the other. After a while, you start to say to yourself \"Haven\\'t we already seen this before?\" It doesn\\'t help that the pacing is awful at times with some scenes going on for way to long while others are cut way too short like the scene where a town is basically controlled by outlaws. We spend so little time there and it was a very interesting scenario that is cut away from. I also take issue with the resolution of the film being not great. Without spoiling the film, we see what happens and you think that that\\'s it but then the movie goes on for another 25-30 minutes and it\\'s really boring aside from one 3 minute long scene with Hanks. It should have ended where I thought it was gonna end. If you like Tom Hanks or Western movies then you might get something out of this but you can wait until it comes out on DVD, Blu-Ray, or rental to watch it.',\n",
       " \"Even Castaway had two characters (Wilson), but the lack of dialogue from the girl gave us almost no insight as to what was going on for her. We only see the Captain's story, and that is a shame. Even The Captain's story isn't really revealed until the very end. It's a good enough Western, but won't move people much.\",\n",
       " 'Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel star in \"True Grit 2: This Time It\\'s Personal\". All jokes aside, this is a rather routine western with good performances and lovely cinematography. A few of the obstacles that the plot contrives feel a tad forced... but ultimately, it is a nice little story about the meaning of home. Helena Zengel is a future star!',\n",
       " \"I was really looking forward to a Hanks western, he's such an amazing actor. This story made zero sense from start to finish. It was also shot in a weird way. A lot of handheld shots alongside steady camera shots, they added nothing to the experience. The acting however was really good. Too bad it was all wasted on such a poor story.\",\n",
       " 'I respect Tom Hanks as an actor who almost always picks great roles with great stories. This had neither. To save you reading an \" Average, Predictable, Cliched, Uninspiring, Not IMRAN Worthy\" review, 😉 ... just know that I\\'ve already said it all in the headline. \"Average, Predictable, Cliched, Uninspiring, Not Hanks Worthy!\"',\n",
