       "[\"Spanish movie. Great ending. Thriller the entire way. Assuming you are like me and don't speak a lick of Spanish, trust me when I say you need to watch with subtitles on in Spanish language. That is a must. Watching the dubbed over version in English will ruin it for you.About a police officer who's first day on the job is tasked with driving an armored police truck to transport a half dozen or so very dangerous cons. During the trip, the truck is attacked in the middle of nowhere by a mysterious maniac who will stop at nothing to get inside the truck and kill one of the cons. Why that Is exactly you don't find out until the end.This movie has suspense from start to finish. Not a dull moment. Very serious. I can't recall chuckling once. Not a horror film but it tiptoes the line with a very eerie setting.I throughly enjoyed the acting and for a movie that takes place mostly from the constraints within an armored police truck, it had me on the edge of my seat throughout. I planned on only watching a bit of this movie and then going to bed as it was already late in the night when I started watching. The adrenaline of the movie kept me going to entire way and I easily finished it in one setting Features a surprise ending I didn't see coming. Has an element of darkness that I find attractive in suspense thrillers like this.If you're someone who can sit though foreign movies while reading the subtitles and you like suspense thrillers, this movie is well worth your time.\",\n",
       " \"Like another reviewer has stated, when I first saw the trailer for Teen Wolf, I was totally uninterested. The only reason I watched the first episode was because it came on directly after the MTV movie awards and there was nothing else on TV. I was actually surprised by how good it was. The acting was good, the special effects weren't too cheesy, and there is something dark and edgy about it. I admit some parts of the plot are predictable, but then again, there are some things that flat out surprised me. The actor who plays Stiles is fantastic, and I think he is a big part of why I like the show. Also, Derek Hale's character isn't too bad on the eyes, either. After all this talk about how this is a Twilight rip-off online, I have to say that I think it's unfair to compare this to Twilight. Let's be real, Twilight has horrible acting, and the acting in Teen Wolf is actually decent. And the plot is completely different in my opinion. In Twilight, the story surrounds Edward and Bella's relationship; In Teen Wolf, I think the story is more about Scott's transformation into being a werewolf and the challenges it brings him. Yes, Allison (his love interest) is a part of those challenges, but the story does NOT revolve around their relationship. This show has a TON of potential, and I could definitely see them going above and beyond what they are doing now. But I am entertained for now and I will continue to watch the season until the end. 8/10\",\n",
       " 'Don\\'t judge this series from the title. Please simply don\\'t. There are various potential open to further interpretation and this piece is fantastically fun! I think the producers should seriously think about updating the \"name\" though. Now Watch and Love!! 1. The story line is pretty much satisfying in the first season. And definitely improves in the second. Great potential awaits.2. Amazing actors/actresses are discovered. Especially Dylan O\\'Brien (Stiles). He is awesome. Both Tyler s (Derek and Scott) are good including the rest of the folks.3. The tension and curiosity manipulations and surprise effects works wonderfully.4. Characters do develop through the second season. They become more appealing and sincere.5. Writers do not bore people with unnecessarily kept secrets (like Merlin who hides his ID for 5 seasons from Arthur... *sigh*) 6. Most importantly, this show makes you want to be a part of it. A part of that world, their world. This is important.Are you still here??? Go and start watching.',\n",
       " \"--MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS--The advertisements of Teen Wolf aired on MTV, or from my location, MuchMusic and I was skeptical of the show, thinking it was slated to be another Twilight. I am no fan of that film franchise that everyone seems to overrate, thus, I thought it would not appeal to me and grew annoyed with MTV about to feature another lackluster show, because the network doesn't have much interesting to offer in my opinion.So one night, I decided to give the series a look while on the web, running behind about 4 or 5 episodes and after watching and catching up on all of them, to my dismay, I was hooked on this series! Now, I anticipate every episode that gets aired and immensely enjoy all of them, something I never thought was possible with any MTV program. I have to commend MTV on creating a series that makes me feel upset if I happen to miss it.The show is loosely based on the 1985 comedy-drama film, Teen Wolf, where a young teen, wanting to be more than an average kid, has to cope with bearing the heredity of werewolf genes that derived from his father, and with the extraordinary abilities that accompany his life as a werewolf, makes him popular at school. I haven't watched the film factually, I only actually managed to seek out the trailer, and it looked pretty cheesy to me anyway so I couldn't care less about it or if the series followed its plot and characteristics bit for bit.MTV's Teen Wolf surely has a darker, suspenseful and edgier premise, and being an avid horror fan, is the reason why I really dig this show. One recurring factor about this show is that it has a great, well-balanced amount of horror, suspense and comedy. It maintains an fun thrill ride and by every commercial and by every end of an episode, there is always an event building up. A lot of potential is definitely going for the series.This show is about a teenage social outcast at Beacon Hills High School, and a lacrosse player at the school that spends more time on the bench than playing. One night, he is bitten in the middle of the woods by a werewolf while in search of a dead body he hears about. After discovering his unwanted inner werewolf, and the remarkable abilities he gains from it that help his normal life out, he is forced to balance two lives (hiding the werewolf one) and protect those meaningful to him.Tyler Posey plays the aforementioned character known as Scott McCall and does a pretty good job acting the role. He has quite the charm in his on-screen presence and has nice chemistry with Crystal Reed, who plays his high school dream girl, Allison Argent. Dylan O'Brien is his genuine best friend on the show playing Stiles Stilinski, and by far, he signed up for a very colorful character that contributes so heavily. Stiles is practically the comic relief guy, who is there to help Scott keep himself collected from harming people during periods of werewolf rage. He's nerdy and suffers from ADD, but that doesn't stop him from being witty, intelligent and sarcastic which leads to some hilarious moments that Dylan executes splendidly. His lines and delivery are certainly top notch. With certainty, Stiles is my favorite character in the show.Tyler Hoechlin is Derek Hale, a survivor of a fire that took out his family, is a mysterious werewolf in town seeking out his sister, Laura and allies and mentors Scott to help him master and control his werewolf abilities. A decent character so far in the show, the role is acted fairly. You also got Holland Roden as Lydia Martin, the mean-girl type and Jackson Whittemore, the lacrosse team captain played by Colton Haynes, both roles of which are being played pretty good.Speaking from a post-teen perspective, Teen Wolf is a superb supernatural teenage series right now on cable television. I have to compliment Jeff Davis on this project as well as Russell Mulcahy, who added the horror element. It brings me back to the days of enjoying shows like Big Wolf on Campus, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. My only pet peeve is how there is only 12 episodes in the first season, I mean in my opinion, seasons should have at least 20 or more episodes.Anyway, 8/10 from me for one of my new favorite TV shows.\",\n",
       " 'My friend had been pestering me to watch this show for a year but I would always refuse. From the little I knew, I had only heard about there being wolves and an unnecessary amount of shirtlessness. Both of course are true but there is another element to the show that makes it different.Mainly the fact that after season 1, they showed us another side of the supernatural world with all the different creatures like kanimas, kitsunes, notgitsunes (to name a few). Another reason being Stiles. Sure everyone talks about him all the time but him and his friendship with Scott really make the show. In seasons 1 and 2 he\\'s the sarcastic, lovable comedy relief which something like teen wolf needs with it being so dark.The characters all develop well as the plot goes on with some great additions. The running theme is always \"who is the -\" in each season like who is the kanima? Who is the darach?Overall it\\'s a really good show and my only regret is avoiding it for so long.',\n",
       " \"First time I saw the commercial to this show, I was really disappointed. Teen Wolf should remain in the 80's where it belongs. Why? Well... it's 80's cheesy to me, but I still love the film. I really thought this was going to be some cheesy rip off... oh how wrong I was. I LOVE THIS SHOW! It's about time that werewolves get the spotlight. No more Twilight glittery vampires that look constipated or stalk you while you sleep. No cheesy vampire brother love triangle with a girl that looks like a girl from their past that happened to change them into vamps. Don't get me wrong. I love vampires but werewolves are hard to make appealing because they are cursed with a curse that brings natural beast out of them.It's not cheesy, it's well acted, great looking.. mmm werewolves (Derek.. my baby!), and the story is very unique. The more and more it goes on, the more I want. I feel so disappointed when each episode ends and I happen to scream at my TV because the credits roll and I want more.There are a lot of werewolf shows that completely go dead because of lack of interest. Like for example 'Wolf Lake', 'Big wolf on campus' and I'm sure there are more, but I forgot them.I want this show to prosper and show that werewolves can be sexy too.\",\n",
       " 'So I heard about this show called Teen Wolf. My friends, both males and females, told me about it and said i should check it out. My first though was \"Oh geeze, not another cheesy, twilight tween flick..\" So I decided to check it out anyways. After watching it, I was quite surprised and much more impressed than what I expected it to be. This is NOTHING like twilight. Sure, it contains some of the clichés Twilight contains, but other than that there is no correlation and A LOT of television shows have clichés like the ones in this show. It also has an interesting story line that is actually pretty good. Although this show is actually quite good, it has its flaws. The acting at some times is forced, but for the most part it is good. The special effects are also lacking, but many good shows also lack this aspect and are still very successful (such as NCIS). I want to point out that I am in fact MALE and not female so this review is from the point of view of an average guy, not some girl who drools over these types of shows. In fact, this is actually one of the first that I am interested in. If this keeps up the pace and doesn\\'t turn into a cliché-fest, this show could be very successful. Although at the time I\\'m writing this there are only five episodes, it is nonetheless an interesting and thrilling show that everyone should check out.',\n",
       " \"Look, lets be honest and admit that season1 Teen Wolf wasn't great, it showed signs of great humour, horror and was extremely inclusive in terms of some real life teenage themes. Again, it wasn't great but it showed potential.Now after finishing it's third season, it is clear that, Teen Wolf has done something that not many shows have the guts to do, and that is, it has matured with its audience. The creator and producers behind the show have realized that people age alongside the show, that we are not the same people from season1 and thus they have enabled Teen Wolf to reach it's potential and beyond. Now we have fully fleshed out relationships, more adult and sexual themes (which c'mon everyone loves), some more suspenseful scenes with a fair amount of horror and still they have managed to include school into their lives consistently (something that is totally frustrating in so many TV shows). Plus the music on the show is awesome.Don't give up after season 1, persevere because I guarantee that it will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\",\n",
       " 'Okay, when i first saw this preview, i thought oh no ! not another lame MTV show! The trailer did not give this show its credit. I decided to watch the first episode , just to see what it was like. And I tell you what. Its fantastic. The actors have true talent for their age. Many people think this is a lame \"Twilight\" Copycat show, It definitely is not. It doesn\\'t even have vampires in it . Plus the storyline is actually based on the person with the supernatural ability, and his day to day struggles, of adjusting with his new ability of being a werewolf. It shows some actual storyline. Other than Twilight. The Plot is better than i expected. The storyline for each episode is well suited, ( the writer and producer are doing a good job of not rushing the storyline) Plus the swoon- worthy guys . (Derek and Jackson) sorry not a big fan of Scott! But to tell you the truth I am disgusted at how people are rating this show. Its unfair. Its only into its 5th episode, (the show is still explaining itself) . The highly commend Vampire Diaries, started out pretty mediocre if you ask me. So please guys give this a chance . Im sure we haven\\'t seen the best of Teen Wolf for ages. I am so excited each week to see every episode.9/10 And trust me im harssh. I just really liked something about this show, i had more to back up my view. Its just im really tired after watching the 5 episodes of Teen Wolf again and again. :P',\n",
       " \"OK first off I'm 36 and seen pretty much everything SciFi/Horror out there. Add to this I'm a fan of the original Teen Wolf (number 2 i mean what the hell was that) also watched the cartoon series which I enjoyed. Also I'm not a fan of much if anything this generation done by MTV.\\nI avoided this show even though a few people said i should give it go. So I decided to keep it for a rainy day. \\nIt started raining yesterday and I'm already on season 2!! \\nBrilliant, solid acting , great effects and fantastic casting around. Season 1 has drawn me in for keeps. I was expecting cheesey teen angst type stuff but no. Its dark, moody with just then right amount of humour. I've got to give a massive round of applause to whoever is in charge of music as it is amazing. \\nOne more thing ... Massive kudos to the guy playing Stiles, he is excellent.\\nSeriously give this a go, you won't regret it. If you do blame me. I'll even give you my address so you can come round and kick my butt.

       " 'The original Magnum, PI, featured the physically imposing Tom Selleck as the lead role, a humble, likeable character trying to make it as a private investigator. Set in the 1980s, Magnum and his cohorts were Vietnam veterans, with Higgins, who managed the estate where Magnum stayed as a security consultant, an older WWII veteran of the British armed forces. Much of the charm of the show was the interplay and banter between Higgins and Magnum.This remake is a travesty, They use the same music, the same helicopter, and the same cast names, but the new version superimposes the current PC dogma, rendering the show unwatchable to fans of the original, and presenting an uninterrupted stream of banal dialogue, ridiculous action sequences, and amateurish screenplay that will not win any new followers.Magnum himself (6\\'4\" WASP Tom Selleck) has been replaced by a diminutive hispanic actor. Rick, who in the original series was small and suffered from \"a glass jaw\" often to comedic effect, has been replaced by a new brawny version. The TC character, an African-American role, however, remains curiously consistent under the rules of this PC universe, although the new actor does not have the charm of the original. The most obnoxious casting change is to replace the curmudgeonly Jonathan Quayle Higgins as a yoga-practicing much younger British dish (who does not like tea). Why bother to leave Zeus and Apollo as dobermans?The new PC Hollywood strictures are very much in evidence: Nuzo, the ill fated white former Marine friend of Magnum, TC and Rick, has an African-American wife, and mixed-race wide-eyed son to fulfill some of the new diversity requirements. There is no doubt about the ethnicity of the villains, however, who are not just caucasian, but are also former US Marines, for good measure- who waterboard people, just in case anyone has missed the ham-handed messaging incorporated into the script.Will Ice Pick return as a trans-gender mobster? Luther Gillis as a St. Louis-based lesbian?I won\\'t bother watching to find out.',\n",
       " 'Wanted to give it a fair shot.I really tried.Felt so forced and fake from the beginning.The dialogue was as if actors were simply reading single sentences back and forth to each other.One of the worse things is they tried to cram 8 years of character development into the first episode.Zero magic here like the original (and only) Magnum, P.I.Hard pass on these rebooted classic TV series. Horrible.#NotMyMagnum',\n",
       " '...but it\\'s trying to be, which means it IS that bad!I swore I wasn\\'t going to watch the remake, but ended up doing so purely out of curiosity. How can I honestly say it\\'s good or bad if I don\\'t even watch it? This show should never have attempted to replicate one of the greatest TV series ever. I am a huge Magnum fan since it was originally aired, and used to pay respects at \"Robin\\'s Nest\" (\"Pahonu\") every time I was on O\\'ahu until it was torn down earlier this year (a large emotional hit already for all Magnum fans!). Now this show comes out...Obviously it has to be \"updated\" with even bigger fake action scenes (courtesy CGI) which distracts as the original never needed such \"tricks\" to make it interesting. The cast isn\\'t bad but they don\\'t come anywhere near the chemistry the original Magnum crew had. And changing Higgins into a woman, that just shows how desperate it is to cater to its audience. Why? John Hillerman was the quintessential actor for the role, and played it beautifully. Changing the character\\'s gender is only pathetic attempt to draw interest to her. Swing and a miss!Unfortunately, Jay Hernandez, Zachary Knighton and Stephen Hill are equally unsuccessful in their roles. Hernandez simply doesn\\'t have the charm and charisma of Tom Selleck (who does?). Knighton isn\\'t bad as Rick but it\\'s not a very deep role in the first place. Hill simply doesn\\'t bring to the screen what Roger E. Mosley did. Lastly, the desperate crossover appearances from the current \\'Hawaii Five-0\\' (another poorly made remake) simply fails. The original \\'Magnum P.I.\\' didn\\'t need Steve McGarrett to bolster its ratings.Overall, the show may have had some chance of success if it simply was another O\\'ahu-based cop/detective show; but as far as I am concerned this is yet one more in a long list of remakes that shouldn\\'t have been made (i.e. the rebooted Ghostbusters, Oceans 8, what else am I forgetting?!?). Has Hollywood really run out of premises on which to base new TV series? Has there been one reboot that actually was worth watching? The new Magnum simply proves that writers cannot depend on nostalgia to bring viewers to the screen. Go back to the drawing board, guys, and come up with something original! These remakes are destined to fail...',\n",
       " 'I know the title is outlandish but let\\'s review:--Disney, remaking animated movies with live actors.\\n--Classics being remade by mediocre actors and crew trying to re-capture the natural magic of the talent that made the originals such groundbreaking classics.\\n--Cinematic phenomenons adding sequel upon sequel in a never ending effort to milk an original until the cash cow becomes the goose that laid the golden egg.\\nand now...\\n--Classic television shows being remade or rebooted....all because Hollywood is devoid of talent - writers, actors, producers, you name it - and completely lacking in original ideas.Now it has come to this. Making a new \"version\" of Magnum P.I. (in which Higgins is now a woman no less - no political correctness there!), as if anything can improve on the true originality of the 1980s series.Sometimes I marvel at how the original came up with the whole concept and structure -- film noir style narration, set in Hawaii, ex-Navy Intelligence, down on his luck aspiring P.I. (no, I prefer Private Investigator), living on the estate of a perpetually absent novelist, under the supervision of an English major-domo with two dobermans, with two fellow Vietnam vets, one with a chopper to enable our hero to move among the islands (something Hawaii 5-0 was lacking) and the other with mafia ties that help our hero in his investigations, and driving a Ferrari, that was not his to begin with, to give him a flare and machisimo that nothing holds a candle to today. Truly original! and still a classic.Now there is this -- for the simple reason that such originality and creativity is TOTALLY lacking in Hollywood today.I am not even going to bother with this series! Instead I am breaking out my DVDs of the original series and will enjoy every minute of them, while this series dies and early, and deservedly undignified death, and their creators vanish into obscurity, hopefully never to enter the realm of television entertainment without taking a few classes on creativity, imagination and originality.',\n",

And instead of being simple PIs, they were complete bad asses capable of taking down international terrorists. That is exactly the same road this Magnum PI reboot is going down, only worse. The action is just as unrealistic, the characters just as unrelatable., character development just as weak and the plot just as nonsensical. But, the lead is even more miscast here than the Angels in that reboot. For the love of God, why can't we just have traditional American hunks like Tom Selleck or the late Robert Urich in lead roles anymore? The public is tired of this casting against type, anti-hero nonsense. And don't get me started about the recasting pivotal role of Higgins as a woman who can take down the same bad guys that later easily kick Magnum's ass, all after getting shot in the arm!And what happened to good old fashioned story telling, tongue in cheek humor and fun banter between characters? Why does everything have to be an all too serious but simultaneously mindless shoot em' up with all too frequent and unbelievable action? If you want an action series about Navy Seals, then write a series about Navy Seals. Don't rebadge a successful series about a quirky private investigator to attract viewers to your mindless action opus about a culturally diverse band of bad assess.\"]"
