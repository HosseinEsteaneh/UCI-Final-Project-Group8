       "['I am not a fan of CW superhero tv series since Smallville production was taken by this network after WB TV and UPN merged. I liked the first season of Arrow but other stuff I was never into it. But this... This is something different. Fantastic score gives every scene the PROPER - for me at least - Superman vibe - no just the hopeful vibe but kind of darker tone too. Something close to a sci-fi atmosphere. It\\'s hard to explain. It just fits perfectly and is enriching the show. The conclusion of the first episode wasn\\'t hard to figure out. I was only waiting for it to happen but it\\'s fine. It shows a lot of today\\'s world problems and it \"hits the spot\" with showing them. I would say that the world looks very realistic. I only don\\'t like the costume that much. I hope they will improve it. The upper part - near shoulders and neck doesn\\'t look natural for Tyler Hoechlin. I didn\\'t feel any excitment seeing him in that costume. But it\\'s the least of problems or may I say - the only that I had with the first episode. Of course it will stick for the rest of the series but I hope they will really improve it for the second season. The show looks promising and I think it\\'s taking a little bit from Smallville\\'s first few seasons. I am curious what will happen to Kent\\'s sons. And that the most important thing when watching a show - it leaves you with wanting to know what will happen next. Don\\'t want to give any details about the story but I hope that the hero part will only be Clark\\'s part if you know what I mean. I don\\'t want this to turn into another pseudo-Justice League flick. It\\'s a show about Superman and let it be about THE Superman and his wife Lois Lan - THE one and only - Clark Kent, the one and only Lois Lane. Good job. It\\'s nice that it\\'s on HBO GO.',\n",
       " \"Being that this is a Berlanti CW show I was NOT expecting much. The Arrowverse shows are all unwatchable now - with the exception of Stargirl, which Berlanti had nothing to do with.\\nWith that being said, I was pleasantly surprised here. Visually its a treat and both the actors playing Lois & Clark do a good job and have nice chemistry. The story and dialogue are pretty good for the most part (its a very basic premise) with only small amounts of the expected CW cringe, which was a welcome change from them.Some highlights were - the opening montage of Clark's life, the chat between Clark & Martha, the Sam Lane scenes & the fight which went half way around the world - and went from night to day. It was very well executed.Some things I didn't like - Jordan was extremely annoying and unlikable for majority of the episode. Being an introverted loner doesn't mean you get a free pass to be a d*ck to everyone. Also, they made Kyle way too angry. It should have been a more toned down performance - I know the Hollywood elite hate small town folks and want to make him a bad guy. But at least try for some nuance to hide your disdain.And lastly, the Luthor virtue signal at the end was laughable. The character is covered head to toe in armor and instead of just saying he's a Luthor, they made him remove his mask first to show black skin (but not reveal his actual face!). Its was the biggest 'Look at me, I added diversity, praise me please!' that I have seen in a while. *Edit - looks like I spoke too soon. JJ Abrams surpassed it in only a few short days.Curious what the season has planned. Would be great if Cyborg Superman (a robotic looking Tyler), Eradicator and Steel all appeared.\",\n",
       " \"It's hard for me to get into shows in a foreign language and I find when they dub something in English it looses all the original emotion and power of the actors performances. That said, I was hooked 30minutes in! Love the story, while the filming locations aren't exotic or elaborate the performances by the cast are more than enough to not really notice. Tone and pace are exceptional for most part and characters are very well written with plenty of depth to explore. There is a fairly strong sense that there may be some deep, surprising secrets in many of the characters and I truly hope we get to see them explored more in future seasons. Netflix has a tendency to cancel series that viewers love so hopefully this isn't another addition to that list. My advice, watch it all, episode 1 through 6, asap. Then watch it again! I gave an 8 out of 10 because they could have done better with building the world the story exists in as well as developing some of the more intriguing characters story for viewers. They only did 6 episodes, an 8 episode arch would have given ample time to add those little things in and would have resulted in viewers connecting with the characters and world better. Despite that, still amazing show!!\",\n",

       " \"I watched the first three episodes. Not because it would have been fun but because i couldn't believe how bad this series is. It's of course always easy to blame the actors for bad story telling in movies and yes they are bad. Very bad indeed. But in addition to that you get a cameraman who strictly refuses to use more than one lens which is unfortunately a super wide angle lens which distorts the faces to the extreme. Which is even more annoying because they use 90% Close-ups. In addition you get a very high depth of field to complete the look you're maybe used to get from your smartphone. I'm actually interested: did they had a storyboard? Did they plan these shoots? I doubt it.\\nBad lighting and often even wrong lighting complete this visual disaster. The sound is like so often in German productions just insanely bad. This series ist no exception to that.\\nBut let's not forget about the directors. Yes, it's also a very poor script and with even weaker and often embarrassing dialogues, but the attempt to bring it to life is even more feeble. Really, I cannot believe that they planned any of there shoots, there is no rhythm at all in any of these episodes, the dialogue is just text the characters throw around them without any benefit to character or story. Bad blocking, no thought behind the images when it comes to the relationship between the characters or their importance in the story.\\nThe whole series looks like a bunch of amateurs going into the woods with a smartphone on a gimbal, sometimes stumbling across some sci-fi film sets and finally sending the material to some unmotivated editors and no one to color grade this mess.\\nHonestly I'm shocked. No just for them not being sophisticated but for their complete lack of shame they proved to have.\",\n",
       " \"Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad\",\n",

They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!And then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some Dijon mustard on for good measure.You don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.That's essentially Game of Thrones. I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. There are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time I come back here I drop it one more star it seems like. Game of Thrones is a beautiful anchovy sundae.\",\n",

       " 'The first 5 Seasons of Game Of Thrones are exceptional, a beautifully structured series. The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.Season 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George\\'s earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as \"bigger than Helms Deep\" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect \\'favorites\\'. I am still going to watch until the end, but I thought I would warn any future viewer to prepare yourself, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than watching terrible writing ruin a otherwise tremendous series.',\n",
       " 'Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like \"Merlin\" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this.',\n",
       " 'As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. So when I saw the preview for \"Game of Thrones\" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn\\'t have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I\\'ve actually got faces to add to the characters that I\\'ve been reading about for a long time. If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. \"Game of Thrones\" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don\\'t get this impression with this HBO adaptation. Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it\\'s taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone.',\n",
       " \"So everyone knows that season 8 blows. It's common knowledge. For the people who haven't yet seen it, is it worth it to watch anyways?Well, yes and no. I would definitely say for most you can still enjoy the majority of the show. However, if you are the type of person that values the destination MORE than the journey, I would be cautious.Seasons 1-4: 10/10Seasons 5-6: 9/10Season 7: 7/10Season 8: 3/10Seasons 1-6 have some of my favorite moments in storytelling, ever. If you are a fan of intense, gritty realism, intriguing plot, and complex characters, I would definitely still recommend this show, just know what you're getting yourself into.MY WARNING TO THOSE STARTING: DO NOT get too emotionally attached to the show. Enjoy it for its quality alone, and understand WHY the last 2 seasons are not as good. This way you will not be depressed for weeks on end after watching the last season like I was.Let this show be the prime example of how a show goes from some of the most compelling narratives I've ever seen, to absolute trash at the end. From a purely analytical standpoint it is quite fascinating to watch.\",\n",
       " 'The first few seasons were genius: It was a refreshing new genre with an awesome cultural touch to it. Even if the timeline wasn\\'t accurate and some characters were thrown together to allow a great story, the show had close to no flaws.Ragnar was a great protagnist and many supporting roles were well introduced.The religious conflict some of the characters had to face was one of the most enjoyable part of the whole tv show.Unfortunately you can easily point out at what moment the producers decided to make another greedy show and ruin what was built during the first 3 seasons.This seems to be a rather frequent problem nowadays.In this show it they could simply have created a spin-off and named it \"the sons of Ragnar\". They could have carried on with whatever they wanted without bombing the story of Ragnar.I am pretty sure that the show wasn\\'t meant to be a financial succes, but once they realised it could become one, fan service begun.Hopefully this trend will end soon and we get producers that carry more about art than money. That will maybe allow us to get some shows that end at the right time and will be enjoyable to rewatch.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been waiting for someone to make a good series about the vikings. I\\'m from Norway myself, and I\\'m naturally interested in our history. I\\'ve only seen two episodes so far, but I have to say - it really looks promising. The surroundings and nature in the two first episodes is exactly how it looks in \"Vestlandet\", the western parts of Norway. Stunnings fjords with waterfalls cascading down the sides. It really looks authentic.The acting is mostly top notch, a few short scenes aren\\'t that great but it\\'s hardly mentionable. It seems like in the beginning, people are speaking an incomprehensible Norse/English mix, and then they continue speaking a modern English. It\\'s pretty clever actually. Fun fact: When the Vikings invaded the British isles they could understand each other\\'s languages.The story itself is really exciting, and I just want to watch more.. I can hardly wait for the next episode to be released. I don\\'t know so much about the Ragnar Lodbrok character, but Rollo (Gangarolf) is a very famous character in the Norse sagas.I highly recommend this show, and I really hope they continue making this for several seasons.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been looking forward to a viking film or TV series for many years, and when my wishes were finally granted, I was very worried that this production was going to be total crap. After viewing the first two episodes I do not worry about that anymore. Thank you, Odin:-)As a person of some historical knowledge of the viking era, I can point out numerous flaws - but they don\\'t ruin the story for me, so I will let them slip. Historical accounts about those days are, after all, not entirely reliable.Happy to see Travis Fimmel in a role that totally suits him. A physical and intense character, with that spice of humor that is the viking trademark from the sagas. Gabriel Byrne plays a stern leader, that made me think of him in \"Prince of Jutland\", and Clive Standen seems like he\\'s going to surprise us.Been pondering the Game of Thrones comparison, since I love that show too, but in my opinion Vikings has its own thing going on. Way fewer lead characters to begin with, and also a more straight forward approach. Plenty of room for more series with this high class!Can I wish for more than the planned nine episodes, PLEASE!!!',\n",

       " \"Maybe it isn't real 100 percent history. Some liberties were taken, but for the most part is seems to ring true.At times it almost seems like a contemporary crime drama, but the facts are there-the raids on British monastaries that did occur in the late 8th century, a fairly realistic depiction on what Norse life was probably like at this timeline, the spectacular countryside with its majestic forests and rivers, and the depictions of the Vikings themselves. Savage, eager to loot and plunder, but nevertheless bound by a sort of code of honor. Their acts are savage and the chieftan seems more like a medieval Godfather who uses his power for his own personal gain and who is not above killing somebody on the spot if he is displeased with his actions. The storyline is fairly literate and not the usual mindless adventure that too many of these movies present to us, and the characters are convincingly drawn and likely motivated. The music is good and the full size replicas of the ships are very accurate. Even the deliberate pace works to its advantage, we are never rushed and the story develops as it moves along. It is never dull and there is plenty of interest to engage the viewer. However, if you are put off by graphic violence , don't watch it. Those times were fairly brutal. Fine entertainment . Enjoy it.\",\n",
       " \"There have been one or two negative reviews posted about this show and I have to say that after 2 episodes, I really like it... nit pickers may say that there are historical inaccuracies, but there are also many myths dispelled ... and with the appearance of Valkyrie on the battlefield at the very beginning of ep1 to take fallen warriors souls, unless you are deluded and believe in that being factual it was clear from the very outset that there was always going to be some dramatic license used. Others say the show is too Hollywood, this has to be the case to some extent but by no means is this another mass produced piece of garbage, unless you want the show cancelled after the pilot it must appeal to a mass American audience as entertainment it isn't a documentary. I personally feel that the show DOES have a European feel which is absent in many historical dramas, the locations are beautiful, the cast has been well selected and act their parts fantastically well. The good guys are instantly likable where as the bad guys you just can't wait to see them get whats coming to them, that is always a good sign as far as I am concerned as i want to see what happens to them and am looking forward to the next episode. So don't be put off by the pedantic armchair historians out there give vikings a chance.. it is what it is.\",\n",
       " \"As usual on IMDb fictional dramas set in a particular period in history attract the bores that insist on bleating 'its not historically accurate'. Well just ignore them as this is a fantastic and exciting look at the relatively unexplored Viking world. In the same vein as other fictional historical dramas such as Spartacus or Rome the plot centres around a single character and their family. We then take a brief look into their world and are shown how dangerous a place the world was at this time. The show has a quality feel to it not like some of the more poorly made historical drama around today (sorry but Camelot was just awful!). The sets are impressive and believable and the direction and framing of each scene is obviously set by a skilled hand. The characters are all interesting and likable and the acting is top notch. The only negative I could draw on was that there could have been a bit more action in the first episode but what action there was was very well done. My advice to you, just watch and enjoy it for what it is and don't be out off by the history buffs. If we insisted on only ever watching historical drama that was 100% accurate I'm pretty sure we would be watching none at all. Great show, a solid nine out of ten.\",\n",
       " 'With the release of the last half of the 6th season we finished the epic seven-year saga of Ragnar Lothbrok and his sons. Whilst I am not sure I\\'d consider \"Vikings\" to be amongst the very top tier of shows I\\'ve watched in my lifetime; I\\'ve certainly enjoyed my time with the Norsemen.Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) is a farmer and raider who becomes a legendary figure amongst the Viking people by establishing consistent navigation techniques and leading successful raids on the various Kingdom\\'s that would become Britain. Rising to become King, his legacy is cemented by the actions of his sons, particularly Bjorn Ironside (Alexander Ludwig) and Ivar The Boneless (Alex Hogh Andersen) who would rule countries and influence politics far from their homelands.The first few episodes don\\'t really convey the scale of the ones that would eventually follow. There are lots of great characters that appear across the run but at the start the show rests on Travis Fimmel\\'s shoulders and he\\'s really good. Ragnar is not a good man, or father and the danger of the character always is present in Fimmel\\'s wild eyes but you still understand why his men fought for him and elevated him so highly that his sons could trade of his name. His sons each derive some aspect of him, Ubbe played by Jordan Patrick Smith is the explorer he wanted to be, Bjorn the noble King, Hvitserk, played by Marco Ilso, is the sufferer and addict and Ivar the vicious warlord. I don\\'t really think any of the characters across the run were poorly performed and it\\'s interesting to look back now and remember some of those characters and the stories that only played for a while.The scale of the show gets bigger and bigger and the battle scenes more and more expansive. I don\\'t feel as strongly as others that the show drops off as it refocuses on the sons of Ragnar but I would accept that some of the stories don\\'t quite end at their natural point or have deviations that don\\'t go anywhere.It\\'s not, for me, in that top tier \"West Wing\", \"Game of Thrones\", \"The Wire\" category, but it\\'s not far below and I\\'m happy to have visited Kattegat for these last few years.',\n",
       " 'IN A NUTSHELL:\\nThis action-adventure movie is based on the video game by Capcom. One of the cast members, T.I., said that it was his youngest son that convinced him to be in the movie because he is such a fan of the Capcom video games. I was curious to hear from real gamers what they thought about the movie and they all agreed the monsters looked awesome. They said the movie is pretty faithful to the original game with some fun fan-service, so that\\'s a good endorsement!As far as the actual movie goes, the fantasy flick was written for the screen and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. That\\'s where the reviews start to head south. The plot is extremely thin, so if you want to just watch an action movie with lots of monsters and screaming, this one\\'s for you. Movies based on video games have been notoriously terrible for some reason. This one will have big fans and haters.There\\'s a joke early in the movie that has gotten this production into serious trouble with its release in China, resulting in its being banned. One of the characters says, \"What are my knees? What kind of knees are these? Chi-knees\". Chinese audiences started posting terrible reviews on multiple platforms to damage the box office sales, accusing the movie of hurtful racism. Pushing their outrage further, the game Monster Hunter: World (2018) received thousands of negative reviews as well within 48 hours. Constantin Film later apologized for that scene, although it is still in the movie.Tip: Eat chocolate while you watch this movie. Just do it.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\\nLots of profanity\\nPeople and monsters in perilous situations\\nHigh body count with bloody, brutal deaths\\nTons of violenceTHEMES:\\nAll of us have our own unique weaknesses.\\nPersistence\\nHope\\nTeamwork\\nResourcefulness\\nSelf-relianceTHINGS I LIKED:\\nThe movie starts out with a bang...and a crash...and screams. In other words, there is no waiting around for something to happen.\\nLots of humor.\\nI\\'ve always loved Milla Jovovich for her unique look and fierce action sequences. I was a little bit disappointed though because she mostly just yells in this movie. Don\\'t get me wrong...she\\'s full-on action. There just isn\\'t very much dialogue.\\nReally good CGI. The monsters look super scary.\\nSome cool weapons. I hear that there are some accurate game mechanics that will please the video game fans. I heard that the director actually went to the game designers to see what they thought of the film and they gave him the thumbs up.\\nIf you\\'re going to watch this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.THINGS I DIDN\\'T LIKE:\\nThe big plot? To survive. Seriously, that\\'s it.\\nSuperfast, over-the-top action scenes that make it hard to see what\\'s going on. Within a 10 second period, there are quite a few cuts which is super annoying.\\nThe movie mostly consists of fighting sound effects and screaming. Oh....and monsters.\\nThe singing...not that great.\\nI would love to have seen more of Ron Pearlman.\\nA bunch of characters emerge out of nowhere but we aren\\'t told much about them, nor get to know any of them.\\nThe ending definitely hints at a sequel.

       " 'When you see the movie trailer, you can\\'t wait to see this film. When you see this film, you\\'ll wish you stopped at the trailer.Aside from the outstanding visuals, effects and landscapes, the awesome cast was wasted on an infantile convoluted screenplay riddled with plot and technical issues. There\\'s hardly any coherent continuity in the writing, and the ridiculous long dragged out and unnecessary scenes made the 103 minute runtime feel over 3 hours long. I don\\'t mind mindless entertainment, but when I feel a 5th grader could\\'ve come up with a better balanced script, the entertainment becomes annoying.Writer, producer and director of the Resident Evil franchise Paul W. S. Anderson, also cast his wife Milla Jovovich, as well as Tony Jaa and Ron Perlman. As a seasoned filmmaker, his directing was horrible. The fighting action scenes had the worst and amateurish choreography I\\'ve seen in a long time. I feel bad for Tony Jaa to have this nonsense on his resume.

It\\'s a shame because I know this had a big budget, and unfortunately it would\\'ve been better served donated to some cause instead of this garbage. It\\'s a very generous 5/10 from me, all going to the visuals and the cast, who I feel sorry for.

       " \"Monster Hunter is a new fantasy action film directed, written, and produced in part by Paul W.S. Anderson, the director of Resident Evil and Event Horizon.In the film, Captain Artemis (Milla Jovovich) and her military unit are transported to another world thanks to a strange storm. In this world they are attacked by dangerous, gigantic monsters, which they find difficult to stop with their military weapons. When Artemis meets the mysterious Hunter, she learns that every monster can be defeated in some way. Artemis decides to team up with Hunter to defeat the monsters and hopefully find a way back to her own world.Paul W.S. Anderson closed the film adaptations of the Resident Evil video game series in 2016. With this film he seems to have started a new video game series filming. Most video game adaptations turn out badly and are often more entertaining for those familiar with the video game the movie is based on. Unfortunately, this is also the case for this film, because the film lacks a real story and clear explanation of what exactly happened in the film. People familiar with the video game or playing it themselves can probably understand this movie a little better.Paul W.S. Anderson has put this film together with editor Doobie White in a messy way, just like he did with his last Resident Evil film. The film jumps from short, moving action scene to the next. This only makes the movie more difficult to follow and because the movie is in 3D this can lead to headaches for some people. They also use a lot of unnecessary slow motion effects, to convey the movie more exciting, but unfortunately the slow motion only makes the movie unnecessarily long-winded. The monsters in the film look good, but you can see that they were placed in the film with CGI, so they do not all come across as credible.The acting is not very prominent either, because no character gets a clear background story, structure or further development in the film. When a monster attacks the group and there are victims, you don't know exactly who they were.\",\n",

In a year where good movies are getting delayed left and right, this abomination somehow made it to the big screen.Video Game adaptations have always been a struggle and this one brings back the memories of Mortal Kombat Annihilation, when people's brains melted from the amount of onscreen nonsense. I do understand that things don't have to be perfectly logic and we just got to accept the events as if it is a game. Unfortunately, this Garbagio doesn't have any common sense, flow or even sensible dialogue.As a matter of fact, you can recreate the movie yourself. Take half bucket of sand, throw in some rocks and aluminum cans, shake it violently while shouting and spinning in a circle, add some water and repeat the procedure. I made a mistake of thinking that at least the action might be good in the cinema but instead, I got two hours of grunts, nonsense and nauseating camera work.

       " 'It\\'s one thing to bring back elements, characters, settings and stories, and to flash them in front of the audience to cash in on the nostalgia and/or recognisable memorabilia but without using it to further the plot and other to do exactly the opposite. It was about time that Star Wars directives understood that it is too unique a product to be lend to corporate filmmakers. Star Wars needs to be understood and its uniqueness has to be acknowledged in order to make the new stories feel like they belong. This may sound too obvious but if you ever wondered why the new SW movies are so controversial this may be the reason.Like with \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse (2018)\" and their comicbook-industry experts participation, the creators behind The Mandalorian were experts of the industry, connoisseurs of the Star Wars Universe and even long time fans. So they were able to not only recapture the aesthetic of the grimy, battered Star Wars but also build upon it taking the most \"subtle\" things into account. Things like the predominancy of puppets and practical effects over CGI, settings you can feel and touch over green screens and the abundancy of not only known elements previously seen in Star Wars, but a whole batch of new creatures, designs and overall plot elements that felt like they belong to this universe and had always been there.Exceeding expectations are not only the visual aspects but the narrative too. It might be too late for some story elements now, but it is of great importance that from now on you try to watch the unraveling of the story unspoiled. I was lucky to have seen the premiere of the show before the \"memefication\" of a certain \"element\" that went viral and became one of the biggest highlights of the show. But for me I saw the reveal of this element unspoiled and I was pleasantly shocked, a memory I\\'ll always carry with me. The ability of these creators to generate such shock value and deep moments it\\'s often baffling to me. This is proof that the creators behind the narrative are fully aware of the complexities of the universe they are tampering with and like an experienced surgeon, they are able to tweak, traverse and call back any Star Wars element as they please and with astonishing results.It seems to be obvious that series creator Jon Favreau turns to gold everything he touches, from his influence in the MCU with the first Iron Man (2008) movie (still regarded today as a favorite among the infinite Marvel movies) to the remarkable and commercially successful live-action Jungle Book and Lion King Disney movies. He seems to understand how to treat a franchise not by exploiting the nostalgia aspects but rather use them to fuel new stories and \"revive\" the experience. Not to mention the contributors to this amazing show hype up the expectations and the quality of the show, from beloved names like Taika Watiti to legendary Star Wars showrunner Dave Filoni. The show today is in the most capable hands possible and away from the corporate meddling of Kathleen Kennedy.Despite everything it does right, I have found some things that distanced me from it. It is merely one small and almost inevitable aspect I don\\'t think a huge lore such as Star Wars can escape from. Something that makes the world-building so real: the subtle callbacks and references found on names and other elements. This is an aspect that non-Star Wars Lore fans (in which I have to identify myself as even though I have read and know some of the deeper lore) will not like or get as they are cast aside for not picking up or straight up know these references. If people don\\'t know what a Gungan is they won\\'t get the \"you are as ugly as a Gungan\" joke, for instance. But as for the rest, the story can be followed and understood because it feels self-contained and you don\\'t need to know much about the SW status quo at the time other than (in simplified terms) an Empire ruled over the galaxy and now it\\'s over, in this world there are mercenaries that adhere to a code among themselves, there\\'s a magical energy flowing through all of us called The Force, there\\'s a group of Force-wielding knights that fight with light swords, and that\\'s about it. Anything else you need to know it is presented in the story or explained through exposition, which in a huge universe that is Star Wars it is a must in order to be able to tell a story worthy of SW.\\nAs for the show itself, these are some of the most predominant reasons why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right (reasons I believe stand out among many others the show has) -- WARNING: MILD MILD SPOILERS AHEAD OF SEASON 1:The treatment of the Force -- long gone were the days when the Force had nothing new to teach us. It seemed we have seen it all and had witness it being reduced to a \"superpower\" the Jedis use to move objects. But perhaps the biggest aspect that seemed to bring controversy is the treatment of the force as this quantifiable and immutable force presented in the Prequels. However, the most successful Star Wars stories have not treated it as such, despite the fact that this new addition was provided by its own creator, George Lucas; in fact, the most successful Star Wars stories have expanded on the capabilities of the force still considering it a mystifying and intangible energy that lives in all of us and the binds the universe together. The Mandalorian takes place post Empire, which means the force has started to be known across the galaxy thanks to the Legend of Luke Skywalker, auguring the return of the Jedi Knights. Therefore, treating the force used by the so-called \"baby yoda\" as a powerful and non-understanding power but in fact recognised by some who have heard of it is a genius move as it makes it magical and uncharted still, a long lost ethereal power that exists beyond our comprehension. The force should be something we don\\'t fully understand yet nor people in universe will fully understand either. By allowing the force to be pure and uncharted, there\\'s room for more creative uses of it that when done right can provide of elevated moments. This are shown especially on episodes 7 and 8 of season 1 where by using terms like \"a group of sorcerers called Jedi\", \"I have heard of this power\" and \"i have seen him move things with its mind\" makes the force more mystified and bewildering.The puppets -- say whatever you want about the incredible alien, prop and set designs of other Star Wars main stream media (TV shows, video games, movies with some really good exceptions of course) but I am one to believe that generally the main reason why none of the later Star Wars media released after the OT were really embraced by everyone as part of the universe is because the \"feel\" of the world we were seeing was not the same. Star Wars stood out from sci-fi like Star Trek and other more \"clean and smooth\" worlds by building a grimy, run-down and almost post-apocalyptic set and prop design with a huge contrast of advanced technology. So when The Mandalorian brought it back, not only by imitating the set and character designs and such but by expanding upon those by using new imagery and creating new alien species that fit with that new world, it was a display of world-understanding beyond any new incorporations Abrams, Johnson and even good ol\\' George Lucas had ever brought post-OT. By bringing back puppets and practical effects and make up it shows and it gives you the satisfaction of knowing in 30 years it will still hold up because they are physical things, tangible by the actors and even though \"baby yoda\" moves and when grabbed looks like a sack of potatoes, you don\\'t mind because you know it exists, it is there, you can hold it. I\\'ll take your fully-functioning puppet over the best CGI because truth is, in some years, the CGI will have improved so much you\\'ll start to see the cracks when looking back.Cinematic Special Effects for a TV show -- this may be known for those who keep up with Star Wars news or watch the Mandalorian documentaries in Disney+, but the innovative tech used for the background and other special effects is almost revolutionary and provides a high quality that resembles that of a cinematic film. Needless to say, the special effects, real-model sets design and other props allows the universe to exist and be tangible instead of rendering a scene that with tim we\\'ll notice it doesn\\'t really existEND OF SPOILERY STUFF --IN CONCLUSION, The Mandalorian is a worthy sequel to the OT, maintaining the same aesthetic, themes and recognisable elements but providing new and incredible ideas that amount to the incredible universe that is Star Wars. If they are able to keep it up it\\'ll become one of the best SW media to come in its history. Disney Star Wars seems to know what it\\'s doing now after stumbling a couple of time and I commend them for it. SW isn\\'t an easy franchise to expand and continue despite the amount of stories that are left to be told. You know the saying \"Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans\". But I praise the work done by everyone involved...... This is the way.',\n",
       " \"The Mandalorian (so far) has everything anyone could ask for. It is SO well-crafted, I have yet to see one flaw in it.Pedro Pascal (is it really him under that mask 100% of the time?) is fantastic as the imperturbable, or so it would seem, outer-space tough guy bounty hunter with a soft, heart-of-gold, and a helmet that into the third episode, still does not budge. We know it's coming though, don't we, and waiting, is a small fraction of the fun. At least it is for me.While it is somewhat on the side of slow-paced vs. fast-paced, in my opinion that just adds to the appeal. You can savor the onscreen antics, action and dialogue, while knowing more is coming. Actually, you find it kind of exquisite in its pacing. I literally dare you to look away. Not because you think you'll miss anything, but because even at its steady pace, you won't want to. Speaking of which, the visuals are quite impressive. The entire thing IS a Lucas Star Wars landscape. At no time can anyone see a 1-minute clip of The Manadalorian without knowing immediately that it belongs to the Star Wars universe. The twist, is that thrown into this universe now, is this strong proverbial cowboy of few words, who carries a big stick.I'm a fan, and can hardly wait for more episodes.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m a big fan of Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks, so I was looking forward to this 19th-century Western. Based on the book of the same name, it tells the story of a Civil War veteran, Capt. Kidd (Hanks) who now serves as a news-teller in Texas. He must bring a young girl, Johanna, to her aunt and uncle. The film is skillfully well-made and leisurely paced, as its tone feels almost lyrical. Its western setting is depicted as harsh and realistic, but still unique and powerful. The film\\'s cinematography of 19th-century north Texas is absolutely impeccable. After \"Nomadland,\" it\\'s the best cinematography of the year. From gorgeous wide shots of prairies and canyons and mountains to detailed sets of important towns at the time such as Wichita Falls, the shots look sublime throughout the film.While the film\\'s pacing is slow, it never feels too slow by any means. In fact, such leisurely pacing feels appropriate to the more lyrical tone of the film--almost like a more gritty version of a ballad. Even though the film is obviously very tonally different from Greengrass\\' other films, such as the original Bourne trilogy and \"Captain Phillips,\" Greengrass is still able to build up lots of suspense at appropriate times over the course of the film--such as a scene when Capt. Kidd and Johanna must out-maneuver a gang of outlaws, a bumpy and dangerous stagecoach ride, and a desert storm. The emotional core between Kidd and Johanna is very well done, and the performances are very strong. Hanks does a great job showing a range of both charisma and grit in the role, and the young actress who plays Johanna is superb. My only criticism of the film was that the film could have developed Kidd and Johanna better as characters, although the limited dialogue between the two of them (as Johanna does not speak English) may be one of the reasons why character development within the scenes they are both together in can sometimes be a bit limited. Otherwise, this is a gritty yet gorgeous Western made with passion and talent. Gladly recommended. 8/10',\n",
       " 'Having read the book made the movie easier to follow. The movie fixed some of the historical flaws in the book.If you are a fan of westerns and the virtues that used to be integral to the genre, this movie will appeal to you.This is like the classic \"Unforgiven\" - a movie that relies on subtle facial changes as the characters grow and evolve.It is a story, not a show.It is about a decent man in a time of turmoil in a land of chaos whose moral compass remains true north.The Captain and Johanna are polar opposites in every conceivable way.Old v young, civilized and urbane v uncivilized and illiterate, wisdom v intuition -It is a journey, like Lonesome Dove.

       " 'Tom Hanks is a 19th century newsman who reads newspaper stories to townsfolk in Texas. On his route of numerous locations, he comes across a young German-born girl who has been living under the care of native Americans who have been slaughtered. He takes it upon himself as her new guardian to escort her across the countryside to safety in the hope of finding her a new home. Along the way, they achieve an expected bond as two lonely souls in a treacherous world of danger of adversity.Hanks is great as always, as the film is told from his weary, anguished eyes. But newcomer Helena Zengel steals the film from right underneath him with a mesmerizing performance as a young girl traumatized by personal tragedy, untrusting of the world around her and just beginning to learn her communication. Together, they bring this rugged journey to life. Director Paul Greengrass makes a vivid recreation of 19th century American wilderness, a land of difficult terrain and occasionally bitter climate. Through it all, it becomes a battle for survival for both the old man and the child he is protecting. An old school tale of American grit, this one is expertly crafted and highly recommended.',\n",
       " \"I didn't really love this film. I think it is competently made and you can tell the director knew what he was doing, i just think it was pretty average.The story is very slow, it is almost a road movie. You can see the ending coming from a mile off. I just don't know if this was a story that needed to be told.The script was pretty beige to me too. It wasn't gripping. It wasn't really passionate either. It just felt like a movie script from a western from 2006 that we have all forgot and you may have rented from blockbuster once but you don't really remember it. It just wasn't fresh.I do think the set pieces were pretty good. They looked really nice and in turn provided some lovely shots. I didn't love the colour of this film. It was very muted. I get that it was a western but it just looked really grey and washed out. Maybe this was a choice i just didn't love it.The acting was pretty good especially from the two leads. Some of the other acting was a bit over the top and out of place. Some of the antagonists seemed like pantomime villains and i also think when they were on screen the script also sagged. It turned into Saturday mourning cartoons a little bit.I do think some of the action scenes were engaging however. I think they were pretty tense and enjoyable to watch.I think you could watch this, just keep in mind it is slow. Do i think it should win any awards. No. But you could definitely check it out.\",\n",
       " 'It wasn\\'t unreasonable for me to be properly excited for News of the World. The newest Hollywood western, and the first new theatrical release in about five months that felt worth taking a trip to the cinema to see, News of the World had two big talents on board: star Tom Hanks and director Paul Greengrass. If there were anyone to put a little blind faith in, it would be two men behind some of the great films of the last three decades. The Greengrass-Hanks pairing, so fruitful in Captain Phillips, is, however, pretty barren in their second outing. News of the World is a considerable disappointment from these two great artists.Based on the novel by Paulette Jiles, News of the World is simplistic to a fault. Tom Hanks is Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a Civil War veteran who currently makes a living reading newspapers to busy townspeople in a sort of theatrical storytime across the country. Kidd stumbles one day upon an orphaned German girl named Johanna (Helena Zengel). Johanna was taken in by Kiowa Indians as a youngin\\' and has completely assimilated to their ways. Kidd figures out that she needs to be transported to her surviving German relatives, and Kidd... takes her there. That\\'s the story for ya. Cross country road trips are not new to the Western genre, but Jiles\\' story strikes me as unusually thin. The attempts to create tension along the way are woeful. At two separate points along the trail, two separate groups of men show up out of nowhere just to announce to Kidd, in so many words, that they will be the bad guys for the next bit. Obviously, these characters aren\\'t the important ones. Kidd and Johanna are.Their relationship is the centerpiece, and I can\\'t really fault it. Hanks, the ever-reliable professional, rolls up his sleeves and says his lines with conviction as he always does. Zengel has an appropriate look; she isn\\'t an annoying little cutie or smug growler as so many movie kids are these days, and she gives a good performance. I might even call it impressive. A scene or two or three of their growing bond hits home. These are the moments when you can see that director Greengrass kind of knows what he\\'s doing.Elsewhere, things aren\\'t as pretty. Greengrass\\' reputation is with visceral shaky cameras and documentary-style filmmaking. That\\'s not what News of the World needs, and it\\'s not exactly what the movie is. But Greengrass is no hack. He\\'s also one of the preeminent masters of immediacy and excitement. Those qualities are what I miss. That is what is glaringly lacking with the approach he brings to News of the World. This isn\\'t a United 93-esque docudrama, brimming with that sort of intensity. News of the World is a traditional story and it is shot like a traditional \"movie\". Just not as painterly or carefully composed as some. However, the only thing that directorial restraint creates is a limp, boring visual look. I think I would have respected a full lean into documentary authenticity here, or conversely, a full lean into John Ford-ian grandeur, but what we get instead is a hesitant attempt to be a little (but not too much) different from Greengrass\\' other works. For the most part, it\\'s soft-focused, claustrophobic and close-up heavy, with only the occasional drone shot to highlight some dull Texan exteriors. Weaksauce. There\\'s a way to envelope an audience in verisimilitude that Greengrass has perfected in his oeuvre (make it tight, immediate, suspenseful), and there\\'s a way to do it on a giant canvas (look at the pictorial magnificence of something like Dances with Wolves). Greengrass and his cinematographer do neither with News of the World. You can\\'t just point a camera at a beautiful landscape and have it transport the viewer there.Nothing grabs in News of the World. Tom Hanks is out there doing his thing, but is Captain Kidd really an interesting character? Is Hanks\\' performance anything special? No. The story is blah, the filmmaking is blah. It\\'s very strange to see Paul Greengrass so lackadaisical. He seems uninterested in the material, and why shouldn\\'t he be? The material is uninteresting. But still, there was something to salvage here. I mentioned that father-daughter relationship. It works on its own, in those individual scenes. But I trusted these filmmakers to come at it with a considered point of view. To put some kind of spin on it. To find something worthwhile in there. That didn\\'t happen. What a shame.57/100',\n",
       " \"I know that people complain about Daveed's acting. I think people need to be aware that an actor should reflect the target audience. As a rule, the new generation is more cerebral than any that have come before. This takes on the appearance of being less animate and more tolerance for grey zone morality. We all remember Captain Kirk not lacking for an opinion on anything. That's not the new way of thinking. There are certainly enough decent actors that pull this show through; Sean Bean plays an excellent Wilford; we can witness both the menace, the desperate need for control and also the vulnerability. Jennifer Connelly's character is also highly engaging. Hers, imho, is the focal point of the whole series. Though seemingly morally grey, she is actually completely and selflessly dedicated to the survival of the human race. I also felt that Annalise Basso did an amazing job as a spoiled and demented rich kid but also with a character arc as well. Steven Ogg also does an amazing job as being, quite literally, the wild card; you never know what he is going to be up to.There are good actors in this show.

       " \"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series.\",\n",

It was pretty contained and I think used it\\'s script and budget really well together.This film does seem a lot cheaper than it actually is, I think most of the money was probably spent on Nicholas Cage. I do however think that they used it well and it didn\\'t really need any more spending on it. I think where it shows it most is the other actors. Some feel like they may have actually just found them in the town they shot at. It doesn\\'t detract from the film it just kind of sticks out a little bit.I think the story is pretty interesting too. It was a little bit different which I appreciated. I think the action was pretty engaging too. I will say at some points the film did sag a little bit and I was like this feels a lot longer than an hour and a half. But for the most part it clipped along.I do think the comedy let it down a little. Some of the jokes were just awful and not funny. You can tell it is meant to be a comedic beat but I honestly was like \"that was a joke?\".I thought the movie looked pretty good for the most part too.I would give it a watch.',\n",

Yeah, I actually wrote that and darn proud.The movie is 10 out of a 10 for fun and similarly, the soundtrack and cinematography was just as top notch.Movie is worth the watch and highly recommended. Most fun movie since 2021 and poised to be a cult favorite. 10 out of 10!\",\n",
       " 'If you\\'re going into this knowing it\\'s a B-grade film (Possibly C), purposely designed to be nothing more than a silly movie to pass your time, then you\\'ll have an okay time.I look at it this way, when watching a film there are two ways to view it: \\'Objectively\\' & \\'Personal enjoyment.\\' When I rate movies I do so objectively, so objectively this movie is a 3 out of 10 film. However, personally I didn\\'t mind the movie, so my own enjoyment was about 5 out of 10.My personal enjoyment level is based on the fact I knew what I was in for, had I just started watching this without knowing it was a B-grade affair I would\\'ve been thoroughly disappointed. However, because I knew what I was in for, I was able to turn my brain waaaaaay off and enjoy the ridiculousness on offer.The story line exists simply to make the events of the film happen, there\\'s no depth to it and it basically doesn\\'t matter. The bi-racial guy they hire to play the black guy is literally a caricature of what it means to be black. He says things like \"Dayuuum\" and \"ya\\'ll\\'s crazy\" and opts to leave his friends behind... Very poor representation of \\'being black\\', but it\\'s something I\\'ve noticed B-grade films do A LOT! Black people are nothing more than a caricature to ridicule in low grade films. It\\'s a real shame, wish movies would stop doing this.The film clearly doesn\\'t have the best budget, so the gore isn\\'t even as much as you\\'d expect, the actions not shot particularly well, lots of cuts, and reactionary shots (like blood splattering on an attackers face) rather than shots of the actual impact, especially when it comes to the human victims. One human they kill isn\\'t even shown dying on screen, another is killed so effortlessly you wonder if all the money dried up before they got to him.TLDR; If you want a crap film you can turn your brain off to and just watch the carnage unfold... have at it. If you\\'re looking for substance and want plot, good characters, theme, attention to detail and competent story telling... look elsewhere, this is definitely not the one for you.',\n",

Horror-Comedy, gore filled slash fest, tripped out gnarly artsy stuff... I love a lot of different types of films... love cult films.But... I\\'ll say it again. THIS MOVIE SUCKS. It\\'s got to be the lamest and worst movie I\\'ve ever seen. The teenage kids are AWFUL. The writing is TERRIBLE. The cinematography comes off as TRASHY and DESPERATE.The filmmakers were really relying on Cage and his cult following ( I definitely qualify for membership) to carry their movie... but even Nicolas Cage can\\'t save this horrible steaming pile.If ya like the concept, play the classic Five Nights at Freddy\\'s computer games. They\\'re funny and scary. They\\'re great. This movie is not.I truly feel sorry for anyone who paid 20 dollars to stream this piece of junk. Just because a movie is trying to be a \"cult film\" doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what makes it good or cool.Ya got 2 stars just cuz\\' my boy Cage is in it. Ya might have gotten 3 or 4 if you gave him some lines. But you didn\\'t. You just had him play pinball... which wasn\\'t cool or neat or anything. It was just outright lame and stupid.

       " \"As the first scene of Tenet came to an end, I looked at my partner and whispered, I'm lost. I'm lost and I don't think I'm ever going to get it.And I was right. What followed was two and a half hours of just an unreal amount of exposition that was distorted by music of SFX. If a film has to be explaining stuff to it's audience at the two hour mark then you've gone wrong. Plain and simple, I don't care if you're Christopher Nolan.Everyone I ask afterwards says that I will get it on the second, third or fourth try. Why does a film need multiple matches to understand it? Nolan is a huge advocate for his films to play in cinemas, which is great, but he must be detached from reality to think that most audience members can afford to go see the same film countless times, with the increasingly expensive movie tickets.Regardless of that, It's good that it was an original idea. But my god, if an unknown filmmaker had turned in this script to a production company, I'm pretty sure they would have thrown it away after 10 pages. The premise is cool, the effects are cool, but that is what you expect from a Nolan film. What I'm also coming to expect is a convoluted plot, terrible dialogue, and a film that will still hit over a billion at the box office.\",\n",
       " 'Its one hell of a complicated film. It will be very hard for an average viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first watch. But the more you watch it, more hidden elements will come to light. And when you are able to put these hidden elements together. You will realize that this movie is just a \"masterpiece\" which takes the legacy of Christopher Nolan ForwardIf I talk about acting, Then I have to say that Robert Pattinson has really proved himself as a very good actor in these recent years. And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus\\nJohn David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well. And I dont think there is a need to talk about Michael CaineTalking about Music, its awesome. I dont think you will miss Hans Zimmer\\'s score. Ludwig has done a sufficient job. There is no lack of good score in the movieGotta love the editing and post production which has been put into this movie. I think its fair to say this Nolan film has focused more in its post production.\\nThe main problem in the movie is the sound mixing. Plot is already complex and some dialogues are very soft due to the high music score. It makes it harder to realize what is going on in the movie. Other Nolan movies had loud BGM too. But Audio and dialogues weren\\'t a problemMy humble request to everyone is to please let the movie sink in your thoughts. Let your mind grasp all the elements of this movie. I am sure more people will find it better. Even those who think they got the plot. I can bet they are wrong.',\n",
       " \"Nolen tries too hard to be clever, all it does is lead to a overly complicated movie, full of plot holes.Nothing really happens, you feel absolutely no emotional connection to any characters, i couldn't have cared less if any of them died or succeeded, wasn't invested in any of them. No character development what so ever.Sound mix was terrible, i couldn't hear half the dialogue, and the action scenes were stupidly loud, my mother was covering her ears and said it was actually painful.Critics are rating it purley because its the great Christopher Nolen, and they are scared they'd be seen as stupid if they said anything other that this is an amzing film. I am not a Nolen basher, i love literally every movie he has done, and was very excited to see this, most disappointed i have been since IT Chapter 2.\",\n",
       " \"Christopher Nolan is my favourite director of all time. However this is an enormous banana skin of a film! Visually spectacular, but it falls way short on:General narrative and plot developmentCharacter development and any kind of emotional attachment to charactersPacing (It's ludicrously fast)Audio (Not sure what they did in post production to make it so bad but some dialogue scenes are almost incomprehensible).I felt angry watching the film, which is a first for me. Feels like Nolan is giving audiences a huge middle finger In trying to keep up, this film arrogantly revels in its own complexity.\",\n",
       " \"If you find movies with nameless characters pretentious, this will fit nicely into the pattern.Not only the protagonist is nameless, but he calls himself The Protagonist- how hilarious. ROFL. The Protagonist is the new James Bond, but not as funny. His story is a graceless mashup of Memento (reverse playing) + Inception (sharp-suited men moving in designer's environments) + Dunkirk (boys club of fighting and running around aimlessly).The Protagonist and his sidekick Neil also do a bit of time travel, to stop an evil - obviously Caucasian - enemy from destroying the world. Evil guy's name is Sator, and there's is also a firm called Rotas, somebody called Arepo and part of the plot takes place at the Opera.Once Nolan's done in trying to impress you with the Sator square, he adds the quantum arrow of time and reversing entropy, mixes it with the most banal female role you can imagine (a trophy, mistreated wife who loves her son very very much), a car chase, a couple of fist fights and an involuntarily hilarious and chaotic final scene involving a red and a blue team (Matrix anyone?).The ending involves a rip-off of Casablanca, with the two male heroes metaphorically kissing goodbye (or hello?) and more of The Protagonist being hyper cool.I understand Nolan likes 5 stars, slick hotels, luxury interior design, expensive suits and first class travel around the world. Also, he's not the sentimental type who can make you sympathise with his characters, but absolutely not giving a damn about any of them doesn't help enjoying this movie either, exactly because the plot is quite banal, but dressed up nicely with some smart - but condescending- gimmicks.\",\n",
       " 'The concept of \"show, don\\'t tell\" was completely lost on the writers room. Every character had to describe every other character as \"the best of the best\", \"the best the agency ever had\", \"the best I\\'ve ever seen\".If you have to tell your audience someone is the best, then they are probably not. The writers are just getting in their own way with excessive dialogue when some simple staging would allow viewers to come to their own conclusions., Instead, we\\'re being TOLD everything.Also, Queen Latifah is a good actress. She is, however, remarkably miscast in this series. The writers aren\\'t writing to her strengths-- rock solid persona and strong delivery. Instead, they\\'re trying to portray her as a seasoned fighter and are putting her in scenes where she\\'s shown being physically violent. Those scenes fall flat due to the excessive jump cuts needed to compensate for the actress\\' lack of natural physicality. The classic 80\\'s series did this well-- writing for McCall as a seasoned veteran in his late 50\\'s vs. a modern spec ops warrior. As such, the original McCall used intimidation more than direct physical violence as his key weapon.This series could be saved but it needs some heavy reworking. Right now it feels like \"Equalizer in Name Only\". Branding this as a remake of the original series is a disservice to all involved. Instead, create a brand new character for your very talented lead and stop trying to retread the past.',\n",
       " 'The only thing I was waiting for was to see Oprah show up as Queen Latifah\\'s sidekick. Now, I\\'m always willing to give just about anything a try and judge for myself if something is good or not. I\\'ve certainly watched enough movies and shows that weren\\'t nearly as bad as other critics made them out to be. I\\'ve also watched enough movies and shows that weren\\'t nearly as good either.Itunes had a \"free episode\" gimmick going with several new CBS shows. I guess CBS is trying to find a way to enhance their ratings. Perhaps they should focus on their racist decisions instead, such as giving Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim inferior pay compared to the rest of the cast of Hawaii Five-O.Now, I\\'ve always liked Queen Latifah, but for this series, she\\'s badly miscast. Even after watching the pilot episode, I just couldn\\'t buy the fact that she\\'s a former operative with \"a special set of skills,\" which would almost certainly mean that she would have had to have been a member of special forces. Much of her dialogue exchange with Chris Noth is about \"old times\" on various missions. In short, we aren\\'t given a plausible explanation that explains her skill set, especially given her age. By the way, only as of February 2020 has a woman been set to pass the Special Forces Qualification Course.The writing isn\\'t very good, which is evident in the overused number of times that cliched lines are given. Also, what is the point of blasting girlie hip-hop music everytime Latifah mixes it up?However, Latifah\\'s performance is good, as is much of the rest of the cast. I also found her style of parenting refreshing as well.The Equalizer would have been much more enjoyable had they focused on her intelligence of being able to out-think her opponents (which she does do a few times) and less on her--unbelievably--mixing it up like some Denzel Washington/Jason Bourne wannabe. In other words, make the show unique and give it its own identity instead of trying to imitate and copy everything that has already been done.',\n",
       " 'Cheesy. Just cheesy. This is a total DISGRACE and dishonor to \"The Equalizer\" character. In this show, the main character of \"The Equalizer\" is portrayed to be some sort of superhero with a mean mug who is also indestructible. That is NOT The Equalizer, not at all. The reason why \"The Equalizer\" was such a successful movie was because the character that Denzel Washington played was real. He was just another guy, another human being who lived like everyone else around him - the only difference being that he sort of lived a double life. This type of character development was done so well. The producers of this show, however, have totally undone everything that made \"The Equalizer\" so intimidating in the first place and replaced all of that juicy detail and character development with a handful of scenes of Queen Latifah jumping out of windows with fire and explosions in the background behind her. Why would they reboot this character and not even try to reboot it? It feels like the title, \"The Equalizer\" is being used simply to gain more attention and popularity. If the producers of this show are going to make The Equalizer a woman, that\\'s okay of course, but they must understand that when it comes to iconic characters in original films, especially successful characters such as The Equalizer, these characters have already made their mark. They have already filled the shoe, so to say. For somebody to just take up an iconic character\\'s position that a certain actor has already mastered, they must either go in a completely different direction with that character or try to use logic to explain why the character is so different. When I see Queen Latifah jumping out of windows and landing like Spider-Man with the title \"The Equalizer\" fading into the screen, I don\\'t say, \"Wow! That\\'s the new equalizer! So cool!\" I think that it\\'s phony. This show is a Halloween costume of The Equalizer. Nothing much else to say about it.',\n",
       " \"The first WW movie was amazing! It clearly demonstrated that a woman super hero can be strong, smart, funny and, most of all, can easily hold her own with her male counterparts. It was a monumental step forward for super hero movies and women in general and I couldn't wait for the sequel. It was very disappointing to see the direction Mrs. Jenkins took this character. The WW in this movie represents and displays all of the stereotypical cliches so many serious actresses have worked for years to dispel. In the first WW she was a badass who fought with passion against evil and stood up for her convictions. In WW84, when she's not pining for her lost love (because we all know a woman is lost without her man, right?) she's winking at little kids while she fights campy bad guys who are literally tripping over themselves to get caught. The female supporting cast isn't much better. Kristen Wiig is the embodiment of the frazzled, clingy stereotype that went out of style in most movies years ago. The only 2 strong women (Connie Nielsen amd Robin Wright) are gone after the first 10 minutes and we are left with weak, campy garbage. The WW in the first film was Christian Bale's Batman. In WW84 we get the Adam West Batman. Such a disappointment.\",\n",
       " \"I've been a reserve law enforcement officer and a volunteer fire fighter, yet somehow I knew going into this show that I wasn't going to be presented with accurate interpretations of the work. Why? Because it's scripted television.Do they get most of the tactical elements wrong? Yup. Are the situations these people put themselves into completely ridiculous? Yup. Are we supposed to care? Nope. It's scripted television.Take any TV show about any specific line of work - law enforcement, Fire/EMS, attorneys, military, hospital/medical - and anyone who works in that field is going to shred the show. Why? Because it's scripted television. I was a professional broadcaster for the better part of 20 years and even though a lot of what happened on WKRP, NewsRadio, and The Newsroom was completely wrong, the shows were still entertaining.If I were a full time cop, firefighter, or dispatcher, the last thing I'd want to watch when I get home is a dead-accurate TV show about what I just did for the last 12+ hours. 9-1-1 is unrealistic and sometimes very silly, but then again it was never meant to be anything but. It's entertainment, pure and simple, and if you go into this show with that in mind, you'll be far less ragey.\",\n",

I noticed most if not all of the negative reviews came from people with years spent as First Responders. Don't take the programme too seriously, it doesn't take itself that seriously. The calls they are responding too prove that and some are quite comical. I too have faulted shows that are not true to real life but those were reality shows where I expect honesty not entertainment like 911.They seem to have used a checklist when writing this show:\\nBlack man - check\\nGay black man - check\\nGay black woman - check\\nAddiction alcohol - check\\nAddiction sex - check\\nAsian - check\\nYou get the picture. I was going to roast it for not having transgender or cross dressers but I'd be stirring and not that serious. The acting is good and I love Angela Basset's sometimes moody character. They said that Hill Street Blues was an accurate show but we know differently now and so this isn't accurate but it is entertaining and a good way to while away an hour without straining the brain. Sort of like Chips when it aired in the late 70s, easy and not serious.One thing I do enjoy is that it is not chock full of the 'beautiful' people, blue eyed blondes who are overly endowed and stretch their performance but usually come woefully short. I can relate a lot better to this cast as opposed to many other shows. I was a bit annoyed that Abby (played by Connie Britton, a woman now in her 50s) was replaced by the much younger Jennifer Love Hewitt (late 30s). Hollywood is still struggling to give quality roles to older woman and 50 is not old!A good 6, enjoy iit for what it is.\",\n",

       " 'I really like this which is another hit rather than a miss for the BBC. The Last Kingdom now joins Wolf Hall and Poldark in its ability to transport me back in time.Obviously this depends on how well you know any given time period. I am more pedantic about the last two world wars so not every BBC effort achieves this. People might love The Crimson Field but in no way did people speak or say things in WW1 that they did in that particular drama. For a reality check watch The Great War: The People\\'s Story.Leaving that era aside we have now watched four episodes of The Last Kingdom and all have been excellent and \"believable\" if that\\'s the right word for what remains fiction. It must be difficult to get it right hence some people on here slating this series. Only slate it for historical inaccuracies if you are that obsessed but don\\'t knock the overall effort for what remains a \"Dark Ages\" drama.Yet it actually feels like it was way back then. This has been achieved in far less stylised way than say Game of Thrones which is obviously not really grounded in any time period yet remains an excellent drama most of the time.Also, with The Last Kingdom there is no gratuitous violence just for the sake of it as there is with some other offerings set in this same time period. You only get occasional violence within the story line so this gives you the opportunity to get interested in the love scenes too and these are not over the top. Also people are allied in all sorts of ways. The end scene in Ep4 was brilliant and sums up what I mean.You can\\'t expect killings all the time. If you want more detail buy a copy of the Anglo Saxon Chronicle. Apparently there are plenty of deaths mentioned in that!',\n",

Fantastic clothes and make up too.It's fairly violent in parts, but it's there for a reason, it never seems done unnecessarily, it's there to add to the story.The acting is fantastic, quite a few big names, none of them last too long it seems, how mean to get shot of Matthew Macfadyen, Jason Flemyng and Rutger Hauer after just a single episode.Alexander Dreymon is absolutely fantastic in the lead role of Uhtred, he's perfect for the part.Loved it 9/10\",\n",

The stories are sometimes lackluster and the comedy doesn't always fit, but as the first season progresses and you start to learn more about the characters and the stories become more inter-woven it all actually makes sense and stands as a pretty solid first season.As the show has continued it's aged like a fine-wine, it's got great stories with crazy twists and turns in every episode and enough great characters that you have to find someone to connect with, whether they be a hero or a villain. The acting is phenomenal, the writing gets better and better each season, and the show is always open to try new things.Even when I expect this show to disappoint me, it doesn't. It is easily one of the most under-rated shows on television, not just in the superhero and sci-fi genre, but altogether. This show deserves the world.\",\n",
       " \"Agents of Shield is one of the best superhero/comic book themed shows out there, and I'm not kidding. All of the hate this series gets is completely unwarranted, and the hate comes from those who only watched the first half season. Ever since then, this show has been on the up, improving every season. Sure, it has a slow and not very strong start, but Agents of Shield gets progressively better as you continue through the series. And the improvement is so drastic that this has become one of the best TV shows I've seen.One of the most special aspects of this show is how it ties into the MCU. Out of all of Marvel's TV shows, Agents of Shield is most affected by, and most connected with the Marvel movies. I can't stress enough how enjoyable it is to watch this series alongside the movies; it is the perfect companion. Only problem being, you'll be annoyed at how the movies rarely recognize the show, but hopefully that too will change in time.Season 4 of Agents of Shield is the real point where you realize just how incredible the show is. It is definitely one of the best seasons of a TV show that I have ever seen, and I've seen many shows. From the likes of what's largely considered some of TV's best: Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, etc. And also other superhero shows, such as; Daredevil, The Punisher, Jessica Jones, etc. Agents of Shield stands tall right amongst these, and season 4 is a must watch. Not just for fans of Marvel, but any Sci-Fi fans. The real strength of the phenomenal season 4 being, the amount of story arch's put into 1 season. It's fast paced, interesting, and emotional.The cast, and the characters they play, are fantastic; and Clark Gregg is the great leader needed for a show like this. I'm happy that they went through with giving the character of Coulson a TV show after the events of the first Avengers, because Agent Coulson in my eyes, is one of Marvel's biggest stars.To all those that denounced this show, give it another chance. Rewatch the show, and really get into it; you will not be disappointed.My Rating: 9.25/10\",\n",

It's not only the main characters though, I often find myself really loving characters that only show up for few episodes, all the props to the writers and the cast.\\nNow the show isn't perfect, it does take some time to gain momentum, the first season while enjoyable is rather slow compared to the rest of the show. also the show tends drop storylines or leave some things unexplained, that doesn't bother me personally, but might bother others.\\nThere is also the connections to the rest of the MCU, which some people see as not enough, others too much, and yeah it can be a bit frustrating when the crossovers you imagine don't come through, but it's not something I'd hold against this show, I think they write around the MCU well enough, all things considered. In fact, I like that the show adds a 3rd dimension to the movies, It is more interesting to me than characters showing up for a quick team up or the like.\",\n",
       " 'I reviewed the show during the first season, when it was just off to a rocky start, and I said it had potential. But that potential has been satisfyingly reached, and continues to increase with every consecutive season. Without giving any spoilers I\\'d like to know that there are a lot of twists later on in the first and second season, that really make it a lot more worthwhile to hang in for, and when you go and re-watch the first season with those twists in mind, you realize that it wasn\\'t just something they threw in to make it more interesting, it was something they planned from the beginning and dropped little hints towards that no one noticed. Ward was my least favorite character, until his true nature was revealed, and then when you go back and look at it with the experience of later events, you can see that there\\'s much more underneath the surface. They were playing the long con, fooling people and thinking they were an average episodic show, when they had much more in mind for it. I have never been excited for any episode of agents of shield as I am the season three premiere, and I can\\'t wait for the secret warriors story arc. The 10 I\\'m rating this is a bit preemptive, because I expect that season three maybe one of the best things to happen to the Marvel universe since Iron man 1, but it\\'s also a bit of an apologetic rating for misjudging it early on in the first season. I now prefer agents of shield to arrow which used to be my favorite superhero show, but is now trailing in a close second.The visual effects get a 10 out of 10, on par with supernatural or fringe The acting gets an 8 out of 10, added points for Agent may, Skyes impressive character development, and a lot of the humorous moments between Colson and Nick fury, or the infinite likable agent tripp, points docked for Fitz and Simmons \"trying to sound smart\" speak in season one, although a lot of their more annoying badly written character quirks are ironed out by season two The writing gets a nine out of 10, mostly because hard to write something I don\\'t see coming a mile away, though it might be a bit generous considering a few of the missteps in the early episodes of season oneThe fight choreography gets a nine out of 10 for how well it blends with the visual effects, though it might\\'ve been a 10 out of 10 if daredevil hadn\\'t come out with that awesome fight scene in the hallway the same yearI now have nothing but high expectations and hopes for the show and I hope it only improves further. A few areas of improvement include Bobbi Morse who is not likable at all, and maybe some kind of seriously superpowered villain, or possibly the skrull invasion, or something on par with that? So far the major antagonists are a bit interchangeable, Whitehall being the major exception, who is probably the best written villain yet. But I feel this show does best with the villain that is both superpowered and covert, mixing subterfuge, espionage and superpowers in action. But the good news is they set up the foundations to make something like that happen spectacularly',\n",
       " \"Its such a cliché to say that every season gets better, I know. But M.A.O.S does just that. As Season 1 wound down, there was speculation that the storytelling wouldn't support the longevity. We wanted to see our favorite heroes from the Marvel Universe but even tie ins with other marvel characters such as Jamie Alexander as Sif from Thor and Sam Jackson as Nick Fury felt like hand me downs from an older sibling. Luckily we got a season 2 and so on. The show's strength seems to be that every new season seems to turn the story on its head and milk more action and drama. With season 4, the show has finally reached a point where it doesn't need any gimmicks. At this point, who cares about the other MCU characters! These characters own their own universe right now. At this point I'd rather see them make an appearance in one of the MCU movies! Season 4 did give us the best Ghost Rider we've ever seen... Now I want to see a Robbie Reyes movie. The season 4 storyline with the LMD's and especially ep 4.15 reminds me of when Star Trek Next Generation finally grew out of the shadow of the original and proved it could carry itself on its own merit.

       " 'It\\'s not many series that age well. This did. My ratings for this series started around 6 or 7 and pushed their way through to almost perfect score. Is it objectively comparable to other 9\\'s or 10\\'s? I am not sure. Is it, subjectively? Hell yeah.I finished the series thinking that I will miss them all. You love the characters and you stay engaged no matter what. They all grow, they all feel and they all live the part. In this final season more than the rest, it is crystal clear that they love the show as well. They have their fun with it and that\\'s something really precious for any viewer.The show touches upon almost if not all the \"big\" hot sci-fi and science subjects. And it does so gracefully. Does it not have cheesy or \"no-sense\" parts? Well yeah it has, how could it not? But who cares? You learn to love even these small drivels as in the grant scheme of the show, they are even funny.The simple truth is that they rocked it on. Both the actors from the first pilot, to anyone else than joined in the later seasons. This is not a masterpiece series and it doesn\\'t need to be. This is not a filming/acting/etc. crew. It\\'s a family. And I am happy to have spent time with them all. To their ups and their downs.Yes, this is a review of a fan so it maybe doesn\\'t ring as objective. But this show got from winning my respect to winning my love, keeping my excitement topped along 7 bloody years, making it difficult for me to write an objective piece. I couldn\\'t have wished for anything different.If you, reading this, haven\\'t watched the series yet: do, you are in for a hell of a ride. If you, reading this, were a part of the people working for this series: thank you. Your work will stay with me along the years and that\\'s something you should be proud of.',\n",
       " \"When it first started, the flash was an exciting new addition to the arrowverse, with its first season being exceptional. Viewers immediately fell in love with Grant Gustin's Barry Allen (AKA The Flash). The first season was amazing and enjoyable, and the story was very complex, yet felt smooth and even.Well, how the mighty have fallen. Over the seasons, we see a decrease in quality. As the producers churn out more and more episodes, the drop in quality is apparent. This is especially so in Season 4, which is by far the worst season of the flash. The excitement has all but faded, as each episode repeats the same things over and over again, with the plot being extremely predictable. It is my hope that the main villain was given more time and that the number of episodes could be decreased, to reduce the number of filler episodes and to end up with a more concise story, that is better told.\",\n",
       " 'This use to be my favorite show. It was really compelling early on, but went downhill after about season 3. I see other people\\'s complaints are mainly about Iris. I do see what they say and agree to an extent - this show has quickly evolved into some weird comic book soap opera. The relationships have become really childish. The script sometimes feels like it was written by a team of 15 year old girls. I\\'d say my biggest complaint, is how stupid its become. The logic has become mind numbingly dumb. Soooo many plot holes. Sooo many inconsistencies. In one episode, called \"Flash Time\", all the Flashes are running near the speed of light. Then, in other episodes, Flash slips on some marbles and goes \"Darn it, the bad guy got away because I fell down. There is no way I\\'d be able to catch up with them now!\" I\\'ve forgiven them alot over the years for using dumb logic in their plot devices, in all their episodes , but its become way too much. The writers don\\'t even care anymore about making sense. They\\'ve relegated this show to pure stupidity. The crisis crossover has been the dumbest thing I\\'ve seen on TV. I mean seriously, in 1 scene, Barry must run on the treadmill to save the multiverse. I use to watch all the arrowverse shows, but I\\'ve dropped all of them but Flash, but soon I will be dropping flash. It\\'s obvious their target demographic for this show are 10 yr old girls. It\\'s become 90% relationships 5% dumb logic 5% flash stuff... I mean really, CW, if you\\'re going to make a comic show, why not make it primarily for the folks who watch this stuff? Why target 10 yr old girls? I know people want to hate on Iris, but I\\'d say she is 10% of the problem. The writers and the showrunner is the main problem.',\n",
       " \"If you had asked me a couple of years ago what the best super hero TV show at the time was, I would have said The Flash.The show started excellently well with a gripping pilot and a good story line. It starts with how Barry Allen becomes The Flash starting with how he gets his powers, then learns how to use/control them and then tries to solve the mystery of his mother's death to avenge his father. Overall season 1 was superb! Season 2 was weak when it comes to the story line but the excitement of seeing new metas, cross over episodes and 'team flash' developing some individual abilities of their own makes watching the season worthwhile.Season 3 has been average at best and my rating of flash that started from a full 10 has dropped to 7 over two years. Constant time traveling and meddling with things not only gets confusing in my opinion, but also makes you lose interest.I would definitely recommend people to give this show a go (especially if you are a DC fan) but the eventual and constant decline of the show is pretty obvious as you go on with the episodes.\",\n",
       " \"Fate is so much different than the colorful Winx from Nickelodeon, but that's OK. It's trying to be its own thing and I think it worked! I was scared it would be as terrible as the other time they tried making a Live Action version of a Nick show (Avatar the Last Airbender), but no, I thought it blew all my expectations out of the water! Abigail Cowan and all her cast mates did such a good job, there's so much to like here!!At first, I thought the characters were all introduced pretty fast, since it starts with Bloom already at Alfea. But don't worry, all of the main cast has their own moments and sub plots. Not going to spoil them here, but I thought Terra (who's basically Flora, with Flora's powers but a different name) had a good arc about finding her real friendships. The scary new villain/creatures called the Burned Ones were also really interesting to me, and there was also a lot of family drama since both Bloom and Stella had rocky relationships with their mothers.Since Fate was made by new people from totally different shows (like Vampire Diaries), there are obviously lots of differences between the cartoon and its tone. Just remind yourself of that, and you can totally enjoy it as a separate show- plus, I kinda love angsty drama, so this whole show was like the perfect pick for me. Please give Fate a chance!\",\n",
       " \"2D characters, overdone plotline, zero effort in clothing, and horrible relationship development between most characters.What I like the most about Winx was the relationship between the characters. The bonds that they made by getting in and out of trouble together and getting to know each other's backgrounds and hobbies. Barely none of that was present in the live adaption. The girls almost never spent time all together for fun. They were convenient relationships because they room together. And the love triangle! Relationship can develop just fine without them!!!!! In Winx Club, there were plenty of relationship troubles to pick from. They throw away friendship for some bad romance development. Aisha's first love interest died, Musa and Riven rocky relationship because of their personality. Stella's trouble with Brandon NOT being a prince and lying about his identity. Actually, between Bloom and Sky there was a third party in the appearance of his fiancé Diaspro. If a love triangle was really needed they could've used her and not ruin Bloom and Stella's friendship.\",\n",
       " \"I dont know too much about the original Winx animated series so I had no expectations for the show. But this show is definition of mediocrity. To summarized this show in as few words as possible 'poor person's harry potter'.I dont get why this show uses terms like Instagram, tumblr, snapchat or other pop-culture references. Why are these fairies communicating with each other using mobile phones? They literally text each other in between tense scenes. Why are people travelling in cars when they can use magic? Seems super inefficient. The technological advancement is all over the place.In the episode the mc unironically said to a male character that he is 'Mansplaining' when he was trying to tell her about various building and facilities in the school. Sometime the dialogues in this shows is total cringe. The lead acts as a spoiled child and super dumb as well, I am really tired of seeing this trope of 'ThE ChoSeN oNe' and everybody constantly reminding her how special she is. These actors straight up look older than 30 and are playing role of 16 yr old just like Jotaro.I think the lore is a little interesting so might stick around till Season 2 to see the direction this show is heading into.Seriously, Netflix, no need to give every high school adaption into this dark and mysterious atmosphere with faded colors.\",\n",
       " 'I could tell it would be bad from the trailer but I wanted to see how bad. Couldn\\'t finish the first episode because I was bored out of my mind. It was slow and they changed so many main points of the original that it wasn\\'t even worth the watch. They changed blooms origin story and made her more of a whiny, rude, white girl that doesn\\'t know how to dress. Also they changed the parent-daughter relationship from refreshing and sweet to disfunctional. Musa\\'s powers were changed, she was white washed, and they made her rude. Stella is bland, she\\'s not a fun friend at ALL. Terra is alright but definitely NOT flora. Yes, flora\\'s character would sometimes be a bit eclectic which got annoying to the others, but everyone got along pretty well from the beginning of the original. I\\'m glad they were being body inclusive but that doesn\\'t excuse the fact they white washed her. Things about the show that I didn\\'t like in general were the boring soundtrack, lack of y2k, everyone had accents (it would\\'ve been better if they mixed in others since it\\'s a school for all realms), all of the actors were too old, the lack of style, the filter on the show was so dark that I couldn\\'t watch without squinting, all the characters got monotone voices, it was missing the different schools and combined them all into one, SO MUCH unnecessary cursing (ig they were trying to be edgy), missing characters, bad magic effects. I really hope they don\\'t go for another season. The show was so painfully boring and I feel no desire to finish it. Honestly just feels like background noise. I heard that the director was going for what\\'s \"trending\" Rn amongst teens and the age group that lived og winx. Unfortunately, Riverdale, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and Vampire Daries has their time but that\\'s the ONLY kind of shows they\\'re putting out for teens.

       " 'This is merely an essay about \"diversity\" and being \"woke\" written by a liberal arts student that\\'s disguised as a TV show.It appears that the writers/producers had a checklist of liberal agenda items they needed to cross off. About the only things they missed (at least in the first half) - the \"me too\" movement, income \"inequality\" and global warming (sorry, meant climate \"change\"). Maybe they are saving those for the 2nd episode?The writing is a cheap and an obvious attempt to paint Texans as a bunch of bumbling intellectually inadequate racist rednecks. I\\'m shocked they didn\\'t get in their jab about Christians in the first 20 minutes of the show, maybe they are saving that one for the 2nd episode too.If the writers/producers/creators want to make a show based in Texas, maybe they should do a little research about the state first.Also, the scene where the lead characters are entering the State of Texas is all wrong. They showed the western part of Texas; if they were driving in from New York, they would travel through the Eastern part of Texas which is NOT desert and mountains. Wow, they couldn\\'t even get that part right.I couldn\\'t make it halfway through this awful show. Too bad too, I really like Rob Lowe as an actor.Looked forward to this show for a couple of months. Highly disappointed.Really tired of political undertones and backdoor agendas (from both conservatives and liberals) being shoved down viewer\\'s throats. I tune into a show to be entertained, not \"woked\".The creators of this show must receive royalty payments from the woke fair or something.',\n",
       " \"When this show first aired, I was not interested on watching a fire fighting drama. Besides, I've been watching another Wolf Production since 1999 and that was good enough for me. However, when Chicago PD was introduced, I decided to watch it because it came on directly after my favorite show and I love TV drama series. I feel in love with Chicago PD because of the zest and criminal kick-ass and I was hooked.When Chicago Fire crossed over with Chicago PD recently, I was forced to watch Chicago Fire. Hummm, Chicago Fire very interesting and exciting I thought. I went to HBO On Demand and watched Season 2 of Chicago Fire. Let me tell you, I didn't cook, I didn't answer my phone, I ordered food delivery service and didn't move off of my sofa(only for bbreak) until I watched every episode. I then went to a local retail store and bought Season 1 and the disconnect from the world started all over again. By now you know where my review is going.Watching Chicago Fire help me to understand Detective Voight, Dawson etc.. and how Chicago PD was piloted. I was upset with me for not watching Chicago Fire initially. Readers, to understand Chicago PD, you have to watch Chicago Fire. I love the intertwining of the shows. It is so damn interesting.Chicago Fire is a potpourri of diversity, family, loyalty, emotions and laughter. A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.I commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled. I am aware it's only entertainment. However it's entertainment in a true and realistic form.One of the Best Shows on TV.\",\n",
       " \"We've all seen shows that started with a very exciting pilot suffer a slow boring death. A good show needs more than a good concept at the start, it needs good storytelling, good acting, likable characters and it needs to find a good pace.The pilot of Chicago Fire was very weak. The story lines felt too familiar (old friends drifted apart through tragedy, secret painkiller addiction, unrequited love etc) and didn't blend together. And, as you can see on this IMDb page, in the next few days a lot reviewers burnt Chicago Fire to the ground.For some reason I kept on watching. The second episode was a bit better, but by the third episode the show really found it's stride. I've just finished watching the fifth episode and came the conclusion that 1. Chicago Fire somehow ended up to be my favorite new show of the year and 2. All the negative IMDb-reviews are now really unfair. Which is why I suddenly felt compelled to write a review of my own. I never do this, so bear with me. Chicago Fire is not a procedural 'fire of the week' show. It actually does the ensemble drama really well. There is nice balance between the characters and I especially like how these characters connect with each other and how the story lines are slowly developed. In a way, it reminds me of The Good Wife, but with more action scenes (which is a great compliment in my world) The friendship between roommates Leslie Shay (Lauren German) and Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney) is great. Severide plays the tough on the outside, soft on the inside guy, who walks away from his medical problems by secretly taking lots of illegal painkillers. Not very original or interesting, but I've got to admit that my cynic self is really warming up to Kelley. Partly because Kinney plays the part very well, and partly because of his genuine scenes and aforementioned friendship with Shay. Shay is gay, but that's not an issue on the show, just a part of who she is. As it should be, I applaud the CF writers for the way they portray her. Her scenes with fellow paramedic Dawson (Monica Raymund)are among my favorites. Dawson also has some cute scenes with new kid on the block Peter Mills (Charlie Barnett), but is too much in love with lieutenant Matthew Casey to notice their chemistry. Sadly for her, Casey is already engaged to another medical professional. This may sound a little soapy or gooey, but actually, Dawson kicks ass. Literally. Which gets her in to trouble sometimes.Lt. Casey is arguably the real star of the show. He is played by Jesse Spencer, whom I liked in his House MD days, but who really impressed me on Chicago Fire. He plays the classic good guy, but not in a boring way. His intense storyline involving a dirty cop truly propelled the show to greater heights. I'm not gonna name every character or storyline, but they're all getting better very fast. (Quick shout out to Eamonn Walker who plays the awesome Chief Boden.) The show may be a bit unrealistic, but that's not what I look for in a good drama. I'm a big fan of Breaking Bad and Dexter, both are very entertaining, and excellently written ánd acted shows, but both are also very unrealistic. Chicago Fire may not yet be on their level of awesomeness, but it is getting there. My point just is, I am really glad I gave this show another chance and I hope that you will too.\",\n",
       " \"After twenty-five years and six Law & Order series, creator Dick Wolf, decided that it was time for a change. His latest idea centers around the heroes of Chicago, and what he did was basically take the show Third Watch, and split it up into three different TV series that interact with each other, on a semi-regular basis, with a fourth one coming later this year. Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., Chicago Med, and Chicago Justice, make up the new look of drama on NBC, and the ratings have been hotter than the show that started it all, Chicago Fire.As I said the show, the story lines, and the realistic way that it's filmed are very reminiscent of Third Watch, which was one of my all-time favorite shows, however, by splitting, the Firemen, Police, and Medical personal into three shows, the story lines run deeper, and the characters and character development is much stronger. This is why Chicago Fire works and is the only real stand alone show about Firemen to actually last more than just a couple of seasons.Every character, even the part-timers have story lines and there is a deep connection to everyone involved in the show, but the main focus of the show is on Jesse Spencer who plays Ben Casey, one of the two guys in charge out in the field. Casey is very by the book and believes in the system, although that faith is tested on a regular basis. The other main focus is Taylor Kinney who plays Kelly Severide, who is the complete opposite of Casey. He will do anything to save lives and get to the bottom of a situation and the rule book be damned! The dynamic often causes conflict and causes people to choose sides, which further lends to the drama of the show.The one negative I have is with how believable the stories are. Obviously it's a TV show and Hollywood is going to take it's liberties. The firemen are going to do things that are impossible and take risks that no one would ever take or survive if they did, but my issue is with things like the time. Someone will be injured and we'll be told they need months of rehab and could be out a year. The captain will talk about not having the money for a replacement and having to work short handed, putting the other men at risk. Then the very next episode, the injured man is back at work and cleared for duty. The actor doesn't even miss a couple of episodes, he's back the very next week. I don't know about you, but things like that bother me. Another timeline issue is involved with the crossover cameos, which don't always line-up. For example, Severide was involved in a Chicago P.D. matter, that was serious, and involved his whole family, but at the same time, there was no mention of it on Chicago Fire and it was business as usual? Obvious timeline issues aside, the action is fantastic, the story lines are gripping, the actors and actresses are as hot and exciting as the fires they are fighting, and there is a reason this is a top ten show. If you haven't started your journey into the heroes of Chicago, start at the very beginning with Chicago Fire Season 1, you won't be sorry.\",\n",
       " \"I love this show!I had been recording this show but didn't get around to watching it, I never really felt like it as it can take time to get into a new series. However, one day when I was flicking through the channels trying to find something to watch, I came across Chicago Fire episode 10, already 15minutes in and as I watched I became hooked! I couldn't even make myself stop watching it and start from the beginning of the series! I watched episode 10 and then episode 11 the following night and then I went back and watched the series from the beginning. I love the story lines, and the characters are brilliant. Nobody cares if the show isn't 100% realistic, it's not a documentary! If you want realistic shows then don't watch Drama TV! It's classified 'Drama' for a reason. I can't wait for the next episode and I really hope this show keeps going for more series to come.\",\n",
       " \"I started watching this show when this was renewed for season 2 because of it's poor season one rating. Now i know why it was not cancel after season one poor performance. It is because every script of every episodes are well crafted and has brilliant characters(not to mention eye candies for the ladies and gays) and has depth in their history. Despite it's lack of excitement and thrills in the storyline it is humbling for a show to give it's viewer a fresh and realistic drama.It doesn't focus all of it's story on firefighting actions and the drama develops in accordance to their character's actions which avoid the feel of rushing in the storytelling which usually every network shows has. I admire the writers courage to develop the underlying plot and suspense in a pace which the story deserves rather than focusing too much on pleasing the viewers. This also gives the audience to connect to their fav characters. This is one of those shows in which if it continues for a while (may be longer than 6 seasons) you will be left very fulfilling and satisfying yet sad and feel hollow when the show ends.Not a cup of tea for everyone but to those who love contemporary drama and has lots of patience, it will be a wondrous treat which more than likely you will ever forget in the future.Like Greys Anatomy i am sure i will be watching this show over and over again.\",\n",
       " '....a freakin\\' awesome movie is what I just watched.Give me some leeway here, as this is my first IMDB review. The way I judge a film is primarily is when I finish watching I ask myself \"Was I entertained enough to such that I would pay to see that again?\".While I admit openly that my threshold for entertainment is low, this one far exceeded that.I have seen Frank Grillo in a few movies, he seems like a bit of a B-Grade Action Movie Guy - boy was I wrong. My opinion has changed greatly such that I shall go seek out other Frank Grillo movies.As the main guy Boss Level, he delivered an outstanding performance. His blasé deadpan attitude was very funny - after all he is a guy who was just over it, starting each day, dying, rinse and repeat,There are some real parallels with Groundhog Day on the journey he takes - the ups and down, and how he games it to his advantage.Mel Gibson was ok, a typical Action Move Antagonist - some of the other quite unique characters maybe be somewhat clichéd, but still very funny.There are no Oscar\\'s here, then again who cares about the Oscar\\'s anymore? What I want is entertainment, and that is what I got, and then some.',\n",
       " \"I going to come clean and say I flat out loved this film. It has a great cast, script, action, direction and of course special effects. Equally important, the choreography in the fight scenes is excellent. I never thought I was being hoodwinked or short changed by careful cutting, rapid shot changes or careful camera placement.Although it has a pretty good if somewhat simplistic storyline, it has been adapted very imaginatively with what is actually quite a lot of forethought planning and development. I felt a little cheated with the ending but on retrospect, I couldn't really have asked for too much more... maybe they're doing a Boss Level II.Normally I expect Frank Grillo to be either a second tier good guy, when the likes of some A-lister is unavailable or possibly out of budget, or a first rate bad guy, a role he tends to somewhat excel in. Here he's the star attraction and with Naomi Watts and Mell Gibson bringing up the rear and it's a good combination.Grillo is sharp, witty, romantic and... well, displays a range as an actor that we rarely see him portray, and he does a great job. As an action actor there are few who can walk in his shoes, both physically and with his on screen presence, let's face it, he gets a lot of work in this area for a good reason, but I wasn't expecting him to be a lead in a role that really demands a lot more of his acting ability, and quite frankly, I'm pleasantly surprised. Not that I'm saying he couldn't act before, just that, well... I've not seen him in many parts where he's had much more to do than be/look hard, and or beat people up.Gibson is Gibson at this stage of his career, gritty, unhinged and accomplished.Watts is never truly convincing as a scientist/doctor/researcher. The rather alluring slinky dress that functions as a lab coat or some other type of boffin garb was ill thought out, but she nevertheless manages to deliver a competent performance whilst adding a sultry appeal that doesn't go unmissed... perhaps the dress isn't such a bad idea after all.The minor cast is for the most part an accomplished line up of add-ins who do a pretty good job in filling in the necessary spaces for villain-hood, goonish ineptitude and thuggery. Some are quite enthralling and I loved the way that a multitude of baddies are employed for skulduggery, even if it is (given the protagonist and his lack of superpowers) somewhat excessive. Whilst Michelle yeo is largely unused, she nevertheless gives the story some credibility.Anyway, I won't give away any details on the plot but it is a good film with a pretty solid delivery all round. I'm not going to nit-pick on the fine points of the story or temporal mechanics of the notions therein, and even though I do like the fact they didn't try and explain away some aspect of science, I didn't so much like that a fair amount of meat was left off the bones of the science aspect of the film... not that it mattered much since it wasn't really the focal point of the film... well, not really.Anyway, go see it. Solid 7.5 out of 10 for me but I'll give it an 8 since it was an unexpected pleasure to watch.\",\n",

Those guys did their best and at the end of the day, they achieved it.\\nI'm one of those people who doesn't get impressed easily, I hate CGI and think that most movie makers these days don't have the balls to make characters with unique, even flawed attributes that go against the Hollywood stereotype.\\nIt ain't the best CGI I've ever seen but I was too busy having fun to judge how well made it was.\\nI'd never score a movie based on it's budged but instead on how well it all works as a whole within its own limitations. 9/10\",\n",
       " \"Now in no way is this show as bad as people thought it would nor is it as good as some of the other reviewers here think it is either.\\nFirst of, Henry Cavill as Geralt is the best part of this show 100%. No doubt about that. The show is worth watching just for his portrayal. He really cares about the character and it shows.\\nPros:\\n-Henry Cavill as Geralt. Can't say this enough.\\n-The fight Choreography is just insane. GOT could have really used some of the insane fight sequences from the witcher series.\\n-The Really amazing moments between Jaskier(Dandelion) and Geralt. They did Jaskier perfectly in my opinion.\\n-Roach\\nCons:\\n-Really bad casting choices like Triss,Foltest and the Driads. Also they butchered an entire portion from the books which was one of my favorite parts from the Last Wish actually.\\n-Nilfgaard Armour. Like who in the right mind actually thought that it looked even remotely good. I wanted to skip the parts where they came up in the screens.\\n-Very unfriendly to people not familiar with the books or games. This is a fan-service. Not entirely a con but you get the point.\\n-DESTINY THIS DESTINY THAT. GOD STFU. I know destiny is a main focal point in the books but it was over done even there. I just got so tired of that word after watching for a while.All in all its worth the watch if you're a fan of the Witcher games/books. I can't praise Henry enough for his performance though. Seriously.\",\n",
       " \"I have played Witcher 3 and read some of the books, I'd say I love W3, they did an excellent job with the characters, the world and the overall writing, and the books are brilliant as well. Now coming to the show, starting with what I liked - Cavill's Geralt is absolutely spot on, he nails it. The production value is also decent and some of the side characters like Tissaia and Jaskier are done well. Fight scenes are top notch, Cavill brings the physicality to them that was required.Now to the bad. Everything is rushed, the pacing is terrible and it's full of awkward timeline jumps that are done so badly that it will confuse even the avid fans of the series. Dialogue at some instances are horrific and the majority of the jokes did not land. The storytelling suffers because of the terrible pacing and the timeline jumps. There is no room for character development, if you do not already know these characters, the show doesn't make any efforts to make you relate to them or care for them(except for Geralt). Infact some of the character and their arcs are changed for the worse in the show. For example, in the books and in W3, Yennefer is sometimes arrogant but she's also genuinely intelligent and cares for people she loves. In the show she does nothing smart, we are just forced to believe that she's intelligent and she throws everyone around her in a dustbin. Yennefer's character segments are all either her whining about what she didn't get from life or acting smart(instead of doing anything smart). She's a complete fool in the show. Other characters like Calanthe, Vilgefortz and Eyck of Denesle are also portrayed horribly.The casting is bad as well. Except for a few actors, none of them seemed like they belong in a Slavic/East European medieval fantasy setting. Beauty is subjective but some people look better than other in general, Triss looks nowhere near as good as she's supposed to, and infact the minor female character(Renfri) that we meet in the first episode looks better than almost the entirety of the rest of the major female cast whom we know are supposed to look beautiful.And talking about Slavic roots, well, there doesn't seem to be any here. There is no hint of the Slavic folklore and culture present in the show. W3 did the adaptation of the folklore so brilliantly with all the different East European(and Scandinavian) dresses and costumes, the various folk monster/beast designs, the stories and superstitions of the land, the little intricate details within the accents and the language, and the rituals and customs of the local people. These are the things that differentiated the witcher series from other medieval fantasy stories. There none of that here. But I'll tell you what's here that CDPR didn't put in their games and neither did Andrzej Sapkowski put in his books - The politics of 2019. There is forced diversity, there is the b***sack Nilfgaardian armor which is intentionally made to look like a d***, to show Nilfgaard as a generic evil patriarchal empire of d***heads, there are characters ruined by the feminist writers' take on them like Yennefer who acts like a snowflake instead how she's supposed to from the books. We have all this and more that no one asked for. It feels like a generic 2019 diversified medieval show with high fantasy elements. This ain't witcher.To sum this up, it's not a straight up bad show, but a painfully mediocre one. Though if not for Cavill's brilliant portrayal of Geralt and the very obvious high production value of the show, maybe I would give this a 3. What they needed to do was to take it slow and do what they did in the first episode(which was the best of the season imo) i.e. start with Geralt's adventures and stories and build up the main narrative(a shorter, more focused one than what this show had) towards a longer season of 13 or 24 episodes. That gives us more time with the characters, and gives the writers more room for exposition and world building, which would have eventually resulted in a more coherent experience. For season 2, I'm hoping they would honor the Slavic foundations and the identity of the witcher series, improve writing and pacing, and deliver quality over quantity without a rush for completing the saga. They might need to change up the writing staff and rethink their decisions for this to happen; but looking at the fan reception of this season, I highly doubt that will happen.\",\n",
       " 'Some context:\\nI have read all the books and stories - love them, for having a good story and being different than other LOTR clones and I have read more than a few of those.\\nI have played all the games - love them, not all equally but they are good taken in historical context.\\nI have seen most Fantasy shows worth watching and some not worth watching, my interest Started with Hercules and Xena and have been watching ever since.Now this show:\\nThe main problem is that it feels like a fan fiction without understanding the source material. I get it that they have to change to suit the TV format and redo the story a bit but the main thing that should not change is the fell of the story. There is too many WTF moments and bad acting. I am no stranger to bad acting and can usually ignore it for an entertaining story as I have done with the Hercules and Xena shows but this show is not entertaining either.The bare bones of the Witcher universe is that the characters should act more or less like real people in a less then friendly world with many injustices and where the protagonists usually get screwed in some way, either by \"destiny\" or by other people that are being petty and cruel or sometimes they get unusually lucky but very rarely.What made Geralt an interesting protagonist is still there to some extent so that aspect is fine. Geralt is essentially a knight errant constrained by a personal moral code that contradicts with the Witcher code, which produces some less than ideal situations for him.However what made Yennefer interesting is now completely gone and what replaced her is an idiot instead of a mature and powerful sorceress, we get a petty child that is angry at the world she asked for.Then there is the casting of this show that is done purely for political correctness to fill some diversity quota and ruin immersion. I care little if they are not the right color but when they suck at acting too then I will call it what it is: a diversity hire.The writing is probably the weakest part of the show with modern colloquialisms and bad story telling, it is an attempt at a less linear story telling that ultimately fails and just confuses people because there are no markers and events to give you a hint of what story tread you are following.The directors and show runners simply suck in most aspects and were also probably hired to fill a diversity quota instead of merit. Something to the effect of we need a woman to direct this instead of someone that understands the Witcher universe and what makes it unique. Bad is bad I don\\'t care who you are, your work sucks.The cinematography is weak and the production values suck, you have a party in medieval times that looks like a pretentious modern party with bricks partially exposed and cheap lighting. The best that can be said about the CGI is that they are equal to the Hercules and Xena CGI.This show is objectively bad and I think people are defending it out of pure fandom for the other material.',\n",
       " \"Production has an incredibly important place to shoot a series or film. Sometimes even a very minimalist story can reach an incredibly successful point after the right production stages. The Witcher series is far from minimalist. The Witcher is one of the best Middle-earth works in the world. Production quality is essential if you want to handle such a topic successfully.The world that The Witcher goes through is a world with its own rules, races, characters, creatures, beliefs, even if it does not seem too strange to those familiar with fantastic narratives. In particular, the first two chapters carry the risk of being too confusing while reflecting the details of this world to the audience. After the chapters where it is difficult to fully understand which character serves whom and why, the story becomes more beautiful as the other characters gradually increase in the narrative. There are two main characters in the narrative except Geralt. One of them is Ciri, who was advised to find Geralt when her lands were taken over by the enemies. The other is Yennefer, a kind of witch whose aim is to gain as much power as possible. While the goal of these two characters is evident, the fact that Geralt at the center of the narrative does not have a significant motivation due to the character's characteristics causes the story to be thrown from one place to another. However, the story deepens as the characteristics of this character become evident and the dynamics of the world in which events take place gradually emerge. It is the primary factor that gives the dark tone of The Witcher's world that people use their power and material resources to seize land. The dark narrative that expresses the evil within man is supported by the visual language of the series. The visual language, dominated by darkness and shadows, brings The Witcher closer to a gothic horror narrative from time to time when combined with the characteristics of the characters it contains. This dark atmosphere also gains a realistic tone with the violence of the series. The Witcher, one of Netflix's most courageous works to date, relentlessly conveys the mess of the world it tells. It creates a consistent and dark atmosphere thanks to well-captured battle and combat scenes and technical details such as image management and music usage. 9/10\",\n",
       " \"The Witcher could have been an epic fantasy and I had high hopes as it seemed like Netflix put a lot of work in to make the series good. What I ended up witnessing was some cheesy show that reminded me of a bad fantasy you'd see in the 90s.The Witcher is based off a series of books, the first being The Last Wish. I've only read the first book but am by no means a purist. Changes can be made to the source material and still be good, as seen with LOTR. It's just that everything else has to be good and that's where the Witcher fails.The overall production of the show is garbage despite the fact that it had a large budget of $70-$80 million. Where did all that money go? Many of the costumes are akin to something you'd find in a bargain Halloween store (looking at you, elves). CGI is also noticeably poor. The world doesn't feel real and it's hard to get immersed when so many things look fake. It's rather impressive that the show looks this awful with such a big budget.The script could definitely use some work. The dialogue at times is hilariously bad, often making a scene that should be exciting turn into something more like a parody. And even the non-dialogue actions ruin battles, like someone taking their helmet off during war to make a cringe scream while being immune to enemies for 30 seconds, or kissing mid battle to unleash a powerful spell.The show is structured in an odd way with different timelines. For me it wasn't too hard to follow but I have seen many others wondering what the hell is going on. The problem with the timelines is that they throw the pacing off. I think the show would've been better if it focused mostly on Geralt and his adventures as those were by far the best parts of the show.The Witcher isn't all bad. Henry Cavill is fantastic as Geralt and I also enjoyed the character Jaskier. There's some good battles with the swordplay being a high point.And it looks like the showrunners are listening to criticism and said that season 2 will have a tighter story. I hope the show can get a bigger budget to improve effects and that the writers can fix some of the bad dialogue. There's potential here, but unfortunately this first season falls short.\",\n",
       " \"Let's start with the good: the protagonist is a fanboy and he's a damn good actor. It's obvious that Geralt is an emotional role that speaks to him and he knows the character and how to portray him. The music is sublime. The discordant fiddles in the music really capture the raw nature of the world that's being portrayed. This might be based in folklore, but it's no fairytale - here be monsters, kings and peasants and all the violence that accompany them. The cinematography is what I least know about, but I find it to be exceptional.The writing and the pacing is where it falls short. Herky jerky backwards and forwards through time, with no notice and integration between the periods. Too much is left unexplained to the uninitiated, those unfamiliar with the Witcher universe, which is a rich and engaging source of storytelling and entertainment. Quite frankly, I didn't recognize this portrayal of Ciri - it didn't feel like her at all and I have no idea what her manifestations of power were meant to signify, why they were important, or how they pertained to the overall plot.I just hope they pull it together for the next seasons.\",\n",
       " \"I neither read the books nor played the games and I really question if they did the show for the people who already were hardcore fans.\\nFor the ones who weren't, the show is a confusing sequence of not so great swords' fights, low-budget monsters and random naked women's scenes.Dialogues are awfull, sometimes even over melodramatic, soap opera-style. The pace so rushed you don't get invested in any character. They say they are in love with a character they met for two minutes and you questioned if is a joke. Or they develop a completely different life driving need from one episode to the next.\\nThe time jumps didn't help either, it could be interesting but is badly done which result in even less coherence of the characters development.The only thing they bothered to build-up is the meeting between Geralt and Cirri, which is the reason why I'm gonna watch the three remaining episodes.\",\n",

That's what happened to me with 'Banshee'.It's amazing this show hasn't found a bigger audience. It has its fans, sure, but as far as the amount of steady viewers is concerned, it's nowhere near playing in the big leagues – yet. When I started to watch the first episode, I expected a decent, but low budget 'neo-noir' crime show with some sexy women and a few good shoot-outs. What I got instead is high-octane pulp cinema that gets your heart pumpin' with adrenalin from the first second, and an opening chase/shoot-out that wouldn't have to hide behind any mega-budget action production Hollywood has churned out recently.Needless to say, I was hooked. This show is raw, gritty, brutal and over-the-top; it's got everything most action films lack these days – and it's absolutely NOT PG-13. Granted, it's pulpy, trashy, sometimes even down-right ridiculous – but I loved every minute of it so far. The production values are among the best I've seen on TV and the cast is fantastic.

       " \"Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.\",\n",
       " 'In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he\\'s just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks \"illusion- woman\" and \"not-the-flash\"....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON. Instead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more \"the next few days of Ultron\". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man\\'s new \"hulk buster\" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie\\'s massive Budget.In The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.And that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously. Fights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights. And yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies. It is here that Marvel studio\\'s continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that\\'s the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.I like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren\\'t for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.',\n",
       " 'The task of bringing together Earth\\'s mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012\\'s \"The Avengers,\" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of \"The Avengers,\" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in \"Ultron\" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.Yet \"Ultron\" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of \"Sokovia\" to New York to the African nation of \"Wakanda\" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of \"Age of Ultron\" is a non-stop blur.The film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in \"The Avengers.\" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.Added to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) – also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch – who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.The fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in \"Ultron\" that it\\'s impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words – it\\'s all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you\\'ll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.Whedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film\\'s best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor\\'s hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it\\'s simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.\"Ultron\" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it\\'s carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with \"Ultron\" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.As \"Phase III\" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel\\'s cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part \"Avengers: Infinity War\" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more',\n",
       " 'I have noticed a trend of negative reviews directed at the humor in the movie. Listen...humor is subjective. It\\'s also a big part of these types of movies. When I read someone criticize the movie because the heroes are dropping one-liners during intense fighting scenes and to them, this downplays the seriousness of the situation or shows a lack of concern for safety from our heroes, I shake my head so hard I get dizzy.This is a comic book movie! It\\'s a fantasy/fiction/whatever you want to call it! I\\'m not a comic book expert, but have been a big fan of the Marvel Universe on film since Iron Man 1. I found the writing in AoU to be sharp and witty. And yes, I laughed more than I thought I would. \"There\\'s not enough character development!\" I\\'ve seen this in the negative reviews, too. Look, we\\'ve had 3 Iron Mans, 2 Captain Americas, 2 Thors, and a Hulk movie to develop the characters. At this point, there isn\\'t much more we really need, is there? Yes, we see more about Hawkeye\\'s personal side here, but to me, that only feels fair since he\\'s not big enough to carry his own film. And given that he\\'s very much just a human with a great set of physical skills and is less protected and faces his mortality far more than the others do, I felt like it made perfect sense here. We see and learn more about Black Widow in this one, as well. So the complaints about character development don\\'t hold any weight to me. It sounds like the angst of a group of people expecting to see the Empire Strikes Back version of the Avengers. In Age of Ultron, we get immediate, sustained action. I don\\'t know about you, but if I\\'m going to watch a movie with a cast of characters that have the abilities of the Avengers, I want to see them in action! The creativity of the collaborative fighting was improved as well and was featured much more so than in the first one. That was something that I think the first film lacked, the side by side teamwork. This movie held my attention from start to finish. As my summary says above, Mjollnir is a pleasantly surprising star of the movie. When you watch it, you\\'ll see why and in my opinion, if you don\\'t enjoy its role here, you really just have a bad attitude!',\n",
       " \"being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now.\",\n",
       " \"It hurts to rate this so poorly, but it certainly deserves the low marks. There were so many things that ruined this movie for me.1) The Storytelling - Or lack thereof. There was not a compelling story to be told here. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story and it felt flat and unfulfilling.2) Plot? - The movie opens with our heroes in the middle of a battle for reasons that are largely unimportant. That pretty much sums up this whole film3) The Love Interest - Totally underdeveloped. We're basically told by the script writer that these two people are in love, but never are we SHOWN that they're falling in love. It rang completely hollow.4) The Humor - There were WAY too many jokes in this movie, and that wouldn't have been all that bad if so many of them weren't eye rollers. Many of them left me groaning.5) Ultron - This guy appears out of nowhere and is woefully underdeveloped. Plus, he's supposed to be some kind of AI but he's constantly cracking off stupid one-liners and making facial expressions that I thought were inconsistent with what and who he was supposed to be.6) Character Overload - There were WAY too many characters to do any of them any justice. I would have liked the film to focus on a smaller group of characters and their relationships with one another, instead, we got a who's who of the entire Marvel universe leaving a lot to be desired.I could go on, but my heart is still aching and I don't want to talk about it anymore. I see that a lot of people liked it and I'm happy that they did. I only wish it hadn't been such a colossal disappointment for me.\",\n",

At what this is the second, improved version of this, which came last time.The only claim that can somehow put up the \"Era of the Altron\" - the presence of the previous film, which though not on purpose, but leveling part of the effect. Nevertheless, we have already seen something similar, and we approximately know what to expect. A group of diverse heroes forced to unite for the common goal, a charismatic villain at the head of a crowd of faceless clones ... It\\'s not that we would not see it, or we did not want to look again ... And it looks like Joss Weedon knows all the pitfalls in itself a sequel. It is no longer necessary to tell the stories of the main characters (just like last time, actually), and we do not even need to disclose the reasons for their interactions, and therefore the movie tells the stories of the characters who were deprived of attention last time. Altron is a jerk, he sings songs, runs over himself and avengers, sincerely not understanding why they are needed, if he is - all such in vibnium. And the Scarlet witch and Mercury, having lost the status of mutants, contributed a huge share of diversity to the action and history, not to mention that there are not many sympatians in the frame.The narrated story serves as a flip bridge to the further development of the cinematic universe, but it was done in a large and effective way, being a worthy continuation of the first part. Joss Weedon thus secured us with you, yourself and the co-owners of the need for the third part and the story of the same story for the third time. Wisely, considering that the history of cinema has repeatedly proved that the same approach in a trickle does not work in ninety-five percent of cases.\\nOne way to hide the roughness and surpass the original is an action, and it was brought here with a surplus. Beginning exactly with what the original ended - the interaction of the Avengers as one, one-piece team, shown by one shot, the second part thus hints that there will be even more. And, believe me, \"The Age of Altron\" does not disappoint, and the viewer will receive a huge amount of beauty and effects, the performance of which is honed in all the previous parts of the universe. Well, we will not forget that this is Marvel - there will be plenty of humor, and even the hammer of the torah will become a real joker.The second phase of the cinematographic universe is coming to an end, and the result of its evolution was presented to the audience. This is no longer a novelty, but no one promised, honestly on the heart. \"The era of the Altron\" - an ideal blockbuster, which is the result of the development of entertainment movies.This is not a streaming production, it\\'s not an attempt to keep up with someone, or to prove to someone something - it\\'s a one-off product, quality and collected manually. Not creativity, not invention, not art. Quality of manual assembly, that\\'s all.',\n",
       " \"Given how teeming with multiple awkwardly-diverse characters the AVENGERS franchise is, you can imagine how difficult and mentally-exhausting it is to gather all these uniquely vivid plot lines, with all their interspersing expositories and asides, and still be able to form one coherent and fluidly-constructed narrative. The first Avengers movie proved itself able to carry the weight of such challenge, and came out successful in delivering one the most poignant superheroic tales ever told. This year, AGE of ULTRON blasts into cinemas carrying the load of mammoth anticipation. While it is expected to perform better—if not as well as the previous release—it will not be totally surprising, and will still be forgivable, if it falls just a feet beneath the staggering anticipation. Well, you can thank Joss Whedon for helming this projec. This movie soars past expectations.In AGE OF ULTRON, as the characters further expand, new names join the team, proving how much more difficult it must be for the screenwriters to still cling to their material's soundness, and make that further engaging and compelling. Nevertheless, Whedon and his prolific team of scriptwriters, come out triumphant over these apparent hurdles, managing again to weave all the heroes' divergent story lines and confine them together into one solid plot. Whedon effectively mines the capacities of these individuals and turns them into the very foundation of his epic superhero saga.Robert Downey's Iron Man/Tony Stark remains as a formidable figurehead in spite of his ever cynical and highly confident posture, while Chris Evans provides a dependable alternative with Captain America's leadership. There's an implicit undertone playing beneath the trajectory of these two leaders' relationship, and that might serve as an indirect catalyst to what is set to unfold in Captain America: Civil War. Chris Hemsworth's guileless 'Thor' is ever militant, yet innocent. This movie also draws more of the previous installment's less-utilized characters, into the scopes of its spotlight. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, enjoys his expanded character whose interaction with other avengers, has immensely improved, and he also has some of the best jaw-dropping action sequences here. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk still smashes, he's as diffident as he is dangerous, and yet still charmingly funny. Scarlett Johanson's character, Black Widow, has been treated with bigger attention, and her presence is never less if not as strong as her male counterparts. To forget the newcomers, Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, is totally unfair too, as these two cemented their fiery presence right at the very first battle sequence of the movie. Same can be said with Paul Bettany's Vision, whose mysterious power might be the very weapon that could propel the Avengers to winning their battle against their biggest enemy: ULTRON. James Spader's voice strikes as the perfect embodiment of the indomitable android ULTRON who is hellbent to rendering the planet to extinction. Spader has the utmost command of the character and has fueled it with utter rage and bitterness, and calm and ease when needed. You're not going to forget Sam Jackson's Nick Fury too, and the rest of his team, including Falcon. He's as effectively leading his team here when he is needed to be as he was, the first time Avengers were called to assemble. It features Andy Serkis' entry to the franchise too, and while it's brief, he manages to established a commanding presence in the movie. The film grants everybody the right amount of exposure to shine, letting both their inner fragilities and physical prowess speak volumes for who they are. Their imperfections claim pivotal share in their greatest undertaking—winning their very own internal battles so they could emerge able to save the world from the wrecking weights of annihilation.Straightaway at the beginning, Age of Ultron throws our heroes into roaring action, drawing us immediately into a surfeit of explosive and visually-omnipotent action extravaganzas that allow every smashing, pounding, flash of beams, flight, and basically everything, assume near-impossible forms of eye-squashing spectacles. It is when all these heroes engage together in combat against their enemies, that the movie subjugates all those hungry eyes, and grasps total domination over the audience's attention, letting the awestruck reception hum along the visual drama as it extends its reach beyond imagination. It is also when all the death-defying sequences and breathtakingly choreographed action set-pieces, spin out to full throttle, that the underlying cause why this band of superheroes fight with their lives, becomes blindingly evident—humanity. This is what had put them into this circle, in the first place, and it's what they are now aiming to preserve even when they have to wrestle with death. Whedon has never deprived these characters of humanity, making each of them similar, albeit their much readily-perceived differences. This summons affection for these characters, which right away the film gathers, whenever it puts the narrative's soul into the spotlight.AVENGERS: Age of Ultron is without fault, but too few and little that they're not even worth-noting. To be able to gather all these radical personas and bring their different worlds into one concrete universe, is already a colossal feat. Whedon proves to be capable of pushing the limits of the movie's accomplishments past that milestone, and the result is never less than monumental. The whole experience imparts an overwhelming sense of satisfaction, yet it also makes the audience hunger for more. Well, the movie lays ground-works and unleashes potential backdoors for the franchise's next chapters, and that makes everything that follows something to look forward to.AVENGERS: AGE of ULTRON is visually enthralling as it is emotionally profound, a cinematic achievement soaring above the previously reached heights in the ever expanding universe of superhero movies. 9/10\",\n",
       " 'The humor, angst and drama are remarkable for a superhero film. In fact, most will consider them remarkable for any type of movie. I can\\'t think of a weak moment in the film, as it is strong from beginning to end. Anyone doubting that this entire cast (new and old) couldn\\'t work well together or that characters would be cheated out of screen time need not worry. EVERYONE gets to shine. Downey as well as Evans are Oscar caliber good in this movie. (Setting up what has to be an amazing next installment in \"Civil War\") All the performances are straight to the point perfect. Hulk is again perfect in his CG transformation and Spader\\'s Ultron uses his wonderful voice and mannerisms to perfection. Each new character is exquisitely cast and the old school guard has never been better. That includes RDJ as Tony Stark. We all loved what we\\'ve seen before from him and this evolution of Stark is even more intriguing. Elizabeth Olsen gives one of the best new character portrayals in recent years. People are going to want to see a LOT more of her Scarlet Witch in the future. Also, Jeremy Renner is finally given Hawkeye material worthy of his abilities and worthy of the character itself. He truly does steal more than one scene and has some of the best one-liners imaginable. This easily fulfilled and the exceeded all of my expectations. I can\\'t wait to see where they branch the Avengers team and concept from this point forward. There are so many great possibilities. This really is everything anyone would want in a movie. It delivers everything I had hoped to see and quite a bit that I didn\\'t even think possible.',\n",
       " 'When the TNG series premiered in 1987, it wasn\\'t greeted well by many of the old-time Trek fans, including myself. It didn\\'t help matters that one of the earliest episodes, \"The Naked Now\" was a superficial retread of the classic \"The Naked Time\" from \\'66. The new episode should have served as a way of spotlighting several of the new crew, but all it did was show them all in heat. I wasn\\'t too impressed. What did work was keeping the central theme of exploration (something lost in the offshoots, DS9 & Voyager). The new Enterprise was twice as large as the original, with about a thousand personnel aboard. Capt. Picard (Stewart) was a more cerebral, diplomatic version of the ultimate explorer we had known as Capt. Kirk. Again, Picard wasn\\'t too impressive in the first two awkward seasons, as some may mistake his caution for weakness. The Kirk-like first officer Riker (Frakes) was controlled by Picard, so the entire crew of Enterprise-D came across as a bit too civilized, too complacent for their own good. It\\'s interesting that this complacency was fractured by the most memorable episode of the first two years, \"Q Who?\" which introduced The Borg. All of a sudden, exploration was not a routine venture.Other memorable episodes of the first 2 years: the double-length pilot, introducing Q; \"Conspiracy\"-an early invasion thriller; \"Where No One Has Gone Before\"-an ultimate attempt to define the exploring theme; \"The Big Goodbye\"-the first lengthy exploration of the new holodeck concept; \"Datalore\"-intro of Data\\'s evil twin; \"Skin of Evil\"-death of Tasha Yar; \"11001001\"-perhaps the best holodeck story; and \"The Measure of a Man\"-placing an android on trial. Except for \"Q Who\" the 2nd year was even more of a letdown from the first. Space started to percolate in the 3rd season. I liked \"The Survivors\"-introducing an entity resembling Q in a depressed mood, and \"Deja Q\" with both Q & Guinan squaring off, as well as other alien beings. A remaining drawback was the \\'techno-babble\\' hindering many scripts, an aspect which made them less exciting than the stories of the original series. As Roddenberry himself believed, when characters spoke this way, it did not come across as naturalistic, except maybe when it was Data (Spiner), the android. The engineer La Forge (Burton), for example, was usually saddled with long, dull explanatory dialog for the audience.In the 3rd year, truly innovative concepts such as the far-out parallel-universe adventure \"Yesterday\\'s Enterprise\" began to take hold, topped by the season-ender \"The Best of Both Worlds,part 1\" in which The Borg returned in their first try at assimilating Earth. After this and the 2nd part, the TNG show was off and running, at full warp speed. There are too many great episodes from the next 4 seasons to list here, but I tended to appreciate the wild, cosmic concept stories best: \"Parallels\"(s7); \"Cause and Effect\"(s5); \"Timescape\"(s6); \"Tapestry\"(s6); and the scary \"Frame of Mind\", \"Schisms\" and \"Genesis.\" There\\'s also the mind-blowing \"Inner Light\"(s5), \"Conundrum\" and \"Ship in a Bottle\"(s6), \"Second Chances.\" The intense 2-parter \"Chain of Command\" was almost like a film, and the great return of Scotty in \"Relics\" was very entertaining, though it showed you can\\'t go home again. The show also continued to tackle uneasy social issues, as in \"The Host\", \"The Outcast\", \"First Contact\" and \"The Drumhead\" as well as political:\"Darmok\", \"Rightful Heir\", \"Face of the Enemy\" and \"The Pegasus.\" The series ended on a strong note, \"All Good Things...\" a double-length spectacular with nearly the budget of a feature film. But it wasn\\'t really the end. A few months later, an actual feature film was released \"Star Trek Generations\"(94). It\\'s rather ironic that the TNG films couldn\\'t match the innovation and creativity of the last 4 seasons of the series. \"Star Trek Insurrection\"(98) for example, is a lesser effort than any of the episodes mentioned above.',\n",
       " \"I have been hooked on this show ever since I rented a couple of episodes on video over 10 years ago. The series was shown on Norwegian Television, but they stopped it at the end of the forth season. I then bought the whole series, one season after another on DVD. I watched all the episodes, and I realized how great this show is. Over the course of the series, the characters deepen and it gets to be more and more interesting. There is the mishap of the second season, but although it was the worst season, it did have some very good episodes, like 'The Measure of a Man' and 'Q Who?'. I have seen this show now five times from start to finish (and I think that will be seeing much more), but I have found that the episodes which are much action oriented, like the double episode 'Chain of Command', was quite boring. I love episodes like 'Darmok', 'The Inner Light', 'Disaster', 'The Nth Degree', 'First Contact' and 'Who Watches The Watchers?' where the crew meet new races or find themselves in a situation that they are not used to.This is a series that can be appealing to people who like to see action in their science fiction and people who like to see, meet and know new races in their science fiction. This was a fantastic show.\",\n",
       " \"Even now it's hard for me to believe that Star Trek: The Next Generation only ran for seven seasons. Watching the reruns on the Sci-Fi Channel the future world we saw is as alive for me as it was first seeing it back in the day when it was initially broadcast.Gene Roddenberry had a boundless faith in the ability of man to overcome his animal nature and make a better world. I've always felt that was the real secret of the success of the first Star Trek series, that it came out at a nasty time in our history and showed us a better world if we're willing to make it so.The initial series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy introduced us to worlds and cultures beyond our's. But it really was only an introduction. TNG took us deep into the politics and culture of various alien races throughout the galaxy. We learned a whole lot about Klingons and Romulans, their thought processes, their culture, their politics and shifting alliances with each other and with such new alien races like the Ferengi and the Cardassians.Jean-Luc Picard as played by Patrick Stewart was an extraordinary man, a really fine representative of civilization on earth. As captain of the Enterprise I felt he was called on more than William Shatner to be a diplomat as well as a warrior. We got to see a little bit more of Star Fleet and the traditions of that future service with Picard and the rest of the crew.As befit a future where races are actually trying to live together we had a great crew on the Enterprise. It consisted of a Klingon security officer in Michael Dorn, a Betazoid telepath as ship's counselor in Marina Sirtis, and even an Android lieutenant commander in Brent Spiner. When Data was off kilter for any reason, with his capabilities he could be dangerous foe.My favorite on the show was young Wil Wheaton as Wesley Crusher, son of ship's doctor Beverly Crusher played by Gates McFadden. A young friend who is now gone envied so much the make believe world that Wesley inhabited. His own life was not so hot, but when he watched TNG he believed in a boundless future and would have given anything to have been having the adventures young Mr. Crusher was having. By the way when the series ended and Wil Wheaton's character was given a resolution of sorts, I thought for sure he was going to come back either in a future Star Trek film or one of the succeeding series. Make It so.TNG's stories and characters since we have several hundred years to see what we make of our future and see what the universe holds offers exciting possibilities. As far as optimism, this show boldly went where no one has gone before.\",\n",
       " \"I only started to watch Buffy recently, 20 years after the first episode was aired, got to say I am very impressed. Now remember this is 2017, people are used to 1080p streaming, Blu-ray / 4K video, and HDMA sound quality, 480i, 2 channel sound and 1.33:1 screen ratio are simply not going to cut it anymore. However, in this case, despite the huge technical disadvantages, Buffy still stands out as a serious and entertaining show, one of the best of its kind. The screen-play are well written, characters well developed, dialogues are actually interesting and thought provoking, plus great acting all around. Joss Whedon is a real genius.Due to the age of the show, I don't know if they will ever release a Blu-ray set, but I can only imagine what a tremendous joy it'd be to watch it on Blu-ray (again). Buffy really sets the standard and example for today's Hollywood, if there is show you can relate to 20 years later, then you know it is not the picture quality or special effects, but the story and acting that speak to you. Comparing this to some of modern day shows, it is clear to me that technical advances don't always improve the quality of a show.\",\n",
       " 'I started watching Buffy when it was almost finished. It wasn\\'t that well-known in Germany at this time and, come on, \"Buffy- The Vampire Slayer\", what kind of title is that? It seemed to have a quite large fanbase and so, one day, I started to watch an episode. From than on, i couldn\\'t stop. Despite the wacky premise of a highschool-girl hunting vampires, i had great fun watching it. I liked the characters. Buffy, the titular character herself was a lot more fleshed out than i expected, and by the end of the first season, i had a feeling that i kinda related to her. How many times can a man in his mid-twenties say that he relates to a highschool girl that kills vampires? The secondary characters were even better, they were relatable, they were funny and you could really feel with them. The dialogue and jokes were brilliant, i laughed out loud quite some times. When the story got tragic, most memorable in the episode \"the body\", i couldn\\'t help but cry a little with the protagonists, something that happens to me very rarely in movies or series. I even feel kinda sad just writing about it right now. Other episodes like \"Hush\" got really scary, something i deemed impossible in a series mainly for teenagers. Of course, some episodes are not as good as others, but the self-awareness, the tongue-in-cheek humour, the characters and sheer creativity of many of the episodes makes easily up for it. And while the underlying moral of some episodes is a bit too open, other episodes really make you think about it.So when i finally reached the finale of season 7, i had the feeling that i had been on a very satisfying journey alongside the characters, having cried with them, having laughed with them, and, most importantly having a ton of great fun. Something i can only recommend to everyone willing to indulge in it.And when its over, you can always watch it again. Once more, with feeling...',\n",
       " \"Sarah Michelle's performance across the 7 seasons is in my opinion the very best by any actor in any TV show or film, ever. It is intense, emotional, witty and very believable. Technically and artistically you will not see a better character portrayal. The first three seasons were probably the best, but there are highlights in later episodes. How she maintained such perfection for so long is beyond me - it must require great dedication, understanding and skill.Buffy TVS is many things to many people, but mainly it is about love and friendship. Buffy and Angel's love story is beautifully crafted and realistically played out, against a rather surreal backdrop. I have always considered the various creatures to be largely metaphorical and mythical in the sense that they are physical manifestations of human characteristics and also take many references from classical literature.There is no doubt that by accident or design, the creators of BTVS turned what may have been a silly kids' show into a meaningful, involving and everlasting tale about humanity. BTVS should be on the school curriculum alongside Shakespeare, for it is at least as well written, and even more relevant to every one of us.A brilliant supporting cast around a core of Gellar, Brendon, Hannigan and Head, give lifetime best performances. Writers, directors, set designers, lighting technicians ... just everyone on the payroll ... nobody involved in the making of this show gives less than 100%.Why Buffy The Vampire Slayer did not gain a wider audience, more awards, and a much longer run is perhaps down to the greatest crime committed in the art of making moving pictures - those pulling the purse strings failed to realise the true worth of the treasures they let slip through their greasy hands.As long as I live I know that every two-bit TV show that comes along with a wannabee Sarah Michelle, and pathetic production-line vampire rip-offs, will just make me cringe and mourn the passing of Buffy, and of Sarah Michelle who with one or two exceptions has never been given a decent feature film role.I love and admire Buffy and the girl who brought her to life, and pray for the day when she returns to rescue me from the humdrum banality of living in this world.\",\n",
       " 'I was left with the general feeling, that \"Captain Marvel\" is a major disappointment.First of all, there is a good story here somewhere, but it\\'s just not well told, and there\\'s too much of it crammed within about 115 minutes. The movie is fast-paced, but never really works, because the pacing is flat and timing is off. Aesthetically, \"Captain Marvel\" has been processed through the same \"Marvel filter\" as the rest of them. Dull. The filmmakers (indie directors of the great \"Half Nelson\") have given absolutely no attention to the music: the score is completely forgettable as are the 90\\'s songs.As for the themes, the MGTOW people are going to have a field day with \"Captain Marvel\\'s\" less than subtle \"feminist agenda\". I\\'m putting that in quotations, because it\\'s more accurately described as simply female agenda. Which is absolutely fine and commendable; the problem is the infantile in-your-face way the filmmakers address the theme. The movie is set in the year 1995, and it really feels made for that year\\'s audience. \"Captain Marvel\" lacks a fresh perspective. And, by the way, any fans of \"Buffy, The Vampire Slayer\" will immediately recognise one pivotal scene lifted from a truly powerful scene in the series finale. In any case, Carol Danvers of the comics was always a decidedly feminist character, so this shouldn\\'t cause any waves. What\\'s lacking, is Carol\\'s wide array of problems: her character history in the comics is one of the craziest in the Marvel universe (which is saying something.). Movie\\'s much simpler.The biggest disappointment, however, is the resourceful Brie Larson. She\\'s just off. I don\\'t know what happened, but the brilliant actress from \"Room\" is nowhere to be seen. She was just the wrong choice, I guess. Still, I\\'m surprised by her lackluster-ness. The cast isn\\'t great, anyways, but at least Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn seem to be having fun.Unlike me, for the most part.',\n",
       " 'This is a very controversial Marvel film. Which seems to be a running trend with Disney films recently. The hype around this film seems to be very mixed, some want it to succeed and some want it to fail, and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons. There seems to be a lot of agendas involved. I do not have any stake in either side because I do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to judge films from that perspective in a positive or negative way. In the same sense that I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to judge a film from a positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved. I don\\'t care if films succeed or fail financially. Film is an art form to me and I just want to see films that are well-made by people who have a lot of passion for their craft.\\nTo start with things I liked, there\\'s some spurts of entertainment that come from this film. Some fun action scenes, the chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson was very on point. The de-aging effects for Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg were surprisingly great. The first act overall was relatively enjoyable, especially the opening action scene. The music/score was pretty good. And the cat was a fun addition. But overall the film was very bland and disappointing.\\nHonestly, I was hoping for better. To me a superhero movie needs to have an interesting story, well developed characters, and it needs to grab me and make me care about what\\'s going on. This applies to film in general. One of the saddest things about this film that I was genuinely hoping I wouldn\\'t have to say is that I don\\'t think Brie Larson did a good job in this film. Brie Larson is an incredibly talented actress so I don\\'t necessarily think she\\'s to blame for that, it might have just been the poor material she was given to work with. As the film progresses she gets increasingly more stoic, and the film never showcases any emotion or vulnerability towards the character for some reason. And her character is given almost all backstory with too much exposition and very little depth. And at the same time there isn\\'t enough given to make you care about her or any of the characters. Overall I don\\'t think she fit the character, the performance was very wooden and uneven. Which is sad to say because you can tell how much passion she\\'s giving towards this character.\\nThe narrative is so scattered that she kind of gets lost in the shuffle & they forget to develop her character. Which was disappointing for me. The storytelling was very messy. This film is trying to be an origin story, a connecting piece to the past as well as to what\\'s going on now, and a set up film for what\\'s to come later. So the film kind of collapsed in on itself because it\\'s trying to do too many things at once.\\nThis honestly felt like Phase 1, which is not a good thing. That\\'s not to say that Iron Man and The Avengers weren\\'t good, it\\'s just that this film feels a lot like the early Marvel films in the sense that it felt like they were still in an experimental phase. They were still trying to figure out what works and what doesn\\'t work about their films. They\\'ve passed that point and they know what works by now so this film as well as all the other new ones should be progressive steps forward, and this film was definitely a gigantic step backwards.\\nThey also don\\'t do a good job making this character feel important or relevant to what\\'s currently going on in the MCU. We\\'re told she\\'s the most powerful character in the MCU, but they never show us that or make us feel that way. The film is a lot of telling rather than showing. Needless to say the writing and directing were pretty lackluster. Also the action other than the opening was not very good or memorable at all.\\nThe Skrulls were fun villains, and relatively unique compared to other Marvel villains, but they weren\\'t really given any character.\\nThere was a lot of fun 90s references but I think the film relies on this as a crutch way too much. Which caused the tone to be very disjointed. They have 90s nostalgia for a little bit, then it feels like a buddy cop film with Nick Fury, and then it\\'s a story about the friendship between her and Lashana Lynch\\'s character. And there\\'s no effort given to make the audience feel emotionally invested in any of these stories. And since it\\'s always jumping back and forth between these contrasting tones, and that made the film uneven as a result.\\nThere are some needless explanations for things that happen in the MCU and when they happened it felt corny and forced.\\nThe film was a fun time but this is the 21st Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so at this point generic fun action films are old and tired. And since there have been dozens of Marvel films at this point they need to live up to a higher standard. So in order for me to like their films at this point they have to do something more than just making a fun movie. I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but DC did it better. Wonder Woman had charm, charisma, and character development. And I Captain Marvel definitely fell flat in this regard. Again, there are moments of potential here, but they are hiding under the bland cliched Marvel formula. It\\'s a very generic film that we\\'ve seen many times before not just when it comes to superhero movies, and I was hoping for more than that. 5/10.\\nPlease see the film though and make up your own opinion on it. Don\\'t listen to what others say, don\\'t give in to online agendas no matter what side they\\'re on. Just go see the film, make up your own mind, and when you do be honest about it, because that\\'s how we get better films, by letting the filmmakers know what works and what doesn\\'t work about their films.\\nBut at the end of the day the fact that this film didn\\'t live up to its potential doesn\\'t matter, and I\\'m still very excited because...\\n\"We\\'re in the Endgame now.\"',\n",

Moment) you find out how she gets her powers near the middle-end) so most of the film Your just wondering how she got them and when you find out your like \"oh right ok was that it\" I just felt like it had lots missing to it...I didnt really care much about her..I was never really woried or felt much toward her like I did for wonder women or any of the avengers...I think the actress who played captain marvel was very woden and not a very good actress...scarlet johanson played her part really well In the avengers so hopefully she can get some tips of her!....I was just really disappointed that this is the hero who\\'s supposed to save the day in Endgame...I thought her powers were not amazing and felt like when she used them they didn\\'t really do much(unless your a juxbox or door) tbh if your seeing this to the up to endgame you don\\'t need to!...has nothing in it that ties to endgame apart from the credit scene which you can get on YouTube and tbh it wasn\\'t all that(if you wondering how fury gets the pager.......*Little Spoiler*********** ******************she gives it to him after he hands it to her earlier in the film but this time she modified it to call her) overall I\\'d say it reminded me of a Netflix marvel show I\\'d say it was watchable but nothing more...annoyed at myself for sticking up for it before I saw it and now I actually want my money back!',\n",

All I can remember is that my mood wasn't hype or down, it was neutral, and as I finished the movie and left the cinema, I was like wow! The action scenes are really beautiful.Imagine, not being fan of any movie like this in particular and just go to enjoy and you remember the sense that the action scenes were exceptionally well done.

The movie is high on action and stunts with some great car and bike chases.It is advisable for you to watch M:I-5 in order to understand what is happening in the movie as both the movies are somewhat inter related.The plot of the movie might not be fresh as we have seen similar plots in the franchise but credit should be given to the makers for it's execution as with some unexpected twists the movie will keep you glued to the screens till the end. The acting is one of the strongest factor of the movie apart from it's stunts and action.Cinematography and it's powerful visuals is the another strong aspect and also the movie is shot in some of the very beautiful locations and is been captured nicely.Climax of the movie is like typical Mission: Impossible climax and will give you goosebumps. The stunts in the climax should be appreciated.Overall in my opinion this is the best movie of the franchise and a must watch.\",\n",

I hope they won't spoil this in the future, and raise their bar, it has really good potential. Just don't be fooled by the trailers like i was.So, just finished the last episode of the first season.

There's almost no budget, so Starfire looks nothing like Starfire, same for Beast Boy. In this universe dropping f bombs is the only way to complete sentences. It's a very dark show based with relationships so fractured, you're left wondering how these people ever came together to begin with.\\nIt's baffling that Geoff Johns is involved. Not only from a writing standpoint, but from a destroying the incredible world Wolfman and Perez created. If he thought he was improving on these heroes, he's sadly mistaken. The writers don't respect the characters they're using here. So many of Dick Grayson's actions goes against the core of who he is. The Titans are a family, they care for one another and build each other up.

There's no substance to anything. Nothing matters. Nothing is important.In season one, more than 3/11 ENTIRE episodes are dedicated to things that have nothing to do with the main plot. Do you know how frustrating it is? Do you know how badly it hurts the pace of the show? Especially with 2 episodes missing from the standard 13 episodes?Season one is dedicated to Raven being emotional and being rescued more than 3 times. Now I get why they'd go for a younger actress and go in that direction. It's to show growth and her transition from an emotional girl who can't control her power to a more mature teenager who's much more relaxed, mono-toned and in control. However the show never capitalizes on it and the difference isn't shown. Even after her heart is broken.Everyone is so angsty about each other when they barely know each other. They talk about each other like they do but they just met or at least didn't spend a lot of time together.This isn't the Titan's show. This is Dick Grayson and the Titan's show. Too much of the focus is on him. Of course he's involved in a love triangle, if not more. Just... ugh.It ends in what would probably be the lamest season finale. Also a cliffhanger. The way it concludes at the start of season two is also super lame. Also season 2 finale is lame.This is disappointing to me honestly... the start of the show really seemed promising, and then it didn't go anywhere for two fricking seasons.Such a shame. I followed the news of the show ever since there were rumors, back when it was supposed to air in TNT. Massive TT fan. You can't imagine my disappointment.One thing the show did right was the costumes. I think most people hated Starfire's costume at the start but later it grew on them. I loved the risk they were taking and how they were trying to reinvent the character. Too bad anything else just... failed.I disagree with anyone about the casting. Maybe Rose isn't that great, but the rest are incredible. It's just the atrocious writing and lack of good directing. But hey, at least they look good.Conclusion: go watch The boys. Much more coherent, comprehensive, realistic, entertaining, much more growth, a lot less predictable, less Easter eggs / name drops to throw you a bone and finally, THINGS THAT HAPPEN ACTUALLY HAVE MEANING.

The answer is that Anna Diop can act, however she is stymied by the script she is given.I wasn't expecting an Emmy caliber show, as long as the writers don't eventually sink the show, the actors seem to be doing a good enough job with a so-so script.\",\n",

Only things that Robin lived with Batman are attractive. The balance between the occasional jokes and the scenes where the heads are blown out is well established.Dick Grayson got tired of Batman and his teachings and started to work as a detective in Detroit. We see Dick has lost control while trying to get out shadow of Batman. This incredibly darkened character almost beats people to death and cannot stop himself. The most successful character of the series, and of course Brenton Thwaites, who plays the character in this success, has a great role. The character on which the series is based is Raven, as anyone who knows a little about the stories of Titans can guess. It's a tasteful to watch Raven. Starfire is an overdone character. I think they wanted the character to look cool, but it was too much for me. Beast Boy's well-known joke and funny are well used. It is successful in scenes where the character turned into tiger. And the CGI wasn't bad either. It is also possible to see the characters from the upcoming Doom Patrol series. And I liked Jason Todd, the new Robin.\\nAll the characters in the series are in a pretty good condition, despite some of the cons.DC has done a good job and has been a promising series for future DC productions.

Aidan Gallagher does a great job portraying an old man in a 13 year old body, it is a believable performance and it is a great character. When it comes to the rest of the characters, Vanya seemed a little flat, and she didnt give me much up until the last few episodes. The story line with Luther and Allison was unnecessary, and at some point i found myself skipping through them. Klaus is a great comedy relief, but we still see a deeper side to him. Definitely one of my favorite characters.The first episode is a bit slow, but it gains some momentum at the end. The story line builds up nicely througout the rest of the episodes. At some points the plot seems a little predictable, but nothing that bothered me too much.I definitely recommend the umbrella academy, and I am looking forward to season two!',\n",

It has a more original scenario than the original story. There are so many aspects of the series that leave the comic book. This is both positive and negative. In addition to all of this, the series has very strange references. In the series, the black comedy is combined with the drama and added fantastic powers onto it. I can say that a good job has emerged with the processing of the subject, family relations and post production. Compared to Marvel productions or superhero teams like X-Men, The Umbrella Academy has less action and slow but is good enough. Acting, music, visual effects were fine. The most successful actors in the series are undoubtedly Robert Sheehan, who plays Klaus, and Aidan Gallagher, who plays Number Five. The series focuses on a family that has been severed from each other, hidden secrets and the past. So if you are expecting the heroes wearing costumes and advanced weapons and vehicles, you will not find you want in The Umbrella Academy. If you determine your expectations accordingly, The Umbrella Academy will be your liked a production. 8/10',\n",
       " \"This is absolutely NOT Star Trek. Star Trek has always been an exciting uplifting series that gives humanity hope and inspires us to look towards a future where we can be better than we are. Discovery is dark, dismal, depressing, one dimensional, and completely devoid of personality. Normally when I watch Star Trek, I find myself wanting to jump into the tv screen and be a part of the crew. But when I watch Discovery I find myself desperate to never be like these horrible, mean, and unfriendly people. Star Trek has always made me excited for the future. Discovery makes me horrified at what the future may hold. Here are a list of specific things I HATE about this series:1.) The people are completely unlikeable. They are mean, unfriendly, miserable and have perpetual resting b-word face. They have no personality. I want nothing to do with these people. I don't like or care about any of them.2.) It's dumbed down. The philosophical focus of Star Trek that attracts people who appreciate thought provoking material has been replaced by the over-use of CG, explosions, fight scenes, and sex to attract the lowest common denominator.3.) There isn't any real discovery on this show, despite being on a ship called Discovery and the series called, Discovery. It's a science vessel that doesn't go out and discover interesting scientific stuff.4.) It should be called Star Trek: Discovering Michael Burnham instead because this show is all about Michael Burnham. Since when has Star Trek been primarily about one person?5.) The Klingons are no fun anymore. Klingons used to be chock full of personality and have always been a rowdy good time to watch. These new Klingons have even less personality than the humans. They are absolutely boring to watch.I could go on and on about how horrible this series is but I don't want to waste anymore time on it. Discovery has no heart, no soul, no personality, and I have no hope for it.\",\n",

(And afterwards the actors who do a great job)THUMBS DOWN FOR THE FOLLOWING ACTORS:1. Sonequa Martin-Green as Michael Burnham is a drama queen and cries way too much. She is far too intense and overacts in situations where a relaxed smile would have been better. After 2 seasons it's clear that she isn't up to the lead character of Star Trek Discovery. Her role as the main character should be more subtle and there isn't any chemistry when she interacts with the other crew members/actors. It seems forced. She's the show's main problem because the crew revolves around her, but she's not likeable, a Mary Sue and hasn't managed to earn respect and gain any real authority over the last two seasons. It's hard to say it that clear but the failing of Star Trek Discovery is due to Sonequa Martin-Greens bad acting performance as the lead and also her incapacity to step back and let other actors and characters shine.2. Mary Wiseman as Tilly just isn't believable as an ensign. It is very hard to accept that in this position on a spaceship you are so confused and unfocused. Her acting is mediocre which makes it even worse.3. Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets is painful to look at - he's boring and his facial expressions are almost always the same: worried and compassionate.4. Wilson Cruz as Dr. Hugh Culber is the most boring and uninteresting doctor in Star Trek history. Where are the rough edges, where is the personality? Drinking a glass of milk is more fun than watching him!HERE THE ACTORS WHO DO/DID A GREAT JOB:1. Doug Jones as Saru is an interesting character and plays his role absolutely believable. He is perfect! And he is a fine captain!2. David Ajala as Book is funny, cool, easy going with his own agenda. Cool character played very well!3. Jane Brook as Admiral Cornwell was very convincing in her role!4. Jason Isaac was fantastic as Lorca!5. Michelle Yeoh as Philippa is a great villain!6.

A couple of great ideas like the mycelial network and alternate dimensions were explored, but we were only treated to superficial whip cream, not the sundae.Klingons degenerated into barely comprehensible villains who have to spit out every word. Their bleached skin, one-dimensional characters have no redeemable value. I miss the warrior race bound by ritual and honor we both loved and hated in past incarnations. The female empowerment clap trap was not consistent with their misogynistic culture and seemed slapped on like a dead fish.Season 2 held promise until episode 7. New Eden almost transported me back to the TNG days. As soon as Spock joined the plot, the story became grade school and every character's IQ dropped below 90. The last episode of Season 2 redeemed it a bit, but not enough to make me pick up season 3.Don't trust the studio hacked ratings. No Trekkie would rate this over 5 stars.

Ohhh dear...yup...we\\'re in for quite a ride. So with Superman dead, Batman and Wonder Woman must arrange a team of gifted individuals to stop the world destroyer Steppenwolf from, you guessed it, destroying the world. Sighhhh...I kinda just want to hug this film and repeatedly whisper \"there, there...it\\'ll all be alright.\". Apprehensively, I went into this unmotivated and expecting the worst superhero film since Suicide Squad. Fortunately, this isn\\'t that bad. But, it\\'s not great either. The film\\'s greatest achievement is the coalition of the Justice League members. Their interactions, mannerisms and even their physicality was pretty much on point. Aquaman, although absolutely useless in this, had the physical prowess of a beastly underwater warrior. The Flash was quirky and provided several comedic moments. Cyborg was essentially the technological logistics manager. Wonder Woman and Batman were the parents who lead their children into battle. Heck, she even refers to them as children! Yet it all worked so well. Remember, this is a comic book adaptation, so the humour and light hearted nature of its source material does show. The human CGI for the most part was actually executed well (far better than \"Thor Ragnarok\") and the slow motion scenes with The Flash were gorgeous to watch. Snyder is typically style over substance, which is apparent here. The story is so boringly uninspired that it defines the word \"lazy\". I cannot be dealing with another \\'save the world\\' situation. I\\'m also becoming irritated with underused, bland and weak villains who are supposed to be absurdly powerful. Steppenwolf was wasted potential. Constant use of green screen, hit and miss script, rushed third act...just too many flaws I\\'m afraid. Was it too soon for a Justice League film considering no origins for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg yet? Personally, I think so.',\n",

Of course there\\'s nothing new in the photo department but that\\'s to be expected, it\\'s kind of an identity for the whole DCEU. I don\\'t like it but hey, that\\'s an artistic choice I won\\'t criticize here, at least it\\'s coherent. But some flaws are more crippling than that. Every single characterization was a bit off and some of them felt like they were forced, especially Barry Allen. Still, the actors do the best they can with the material so it\\'s not unbearable. Every situation (and even the chain of events) is so predictable (cliché even) that it gets you out of the movie. This level of \"nothing new\" is damaging to the story as it stops you from caring about anything. And it seems like the producers knew this cause they threw in the mandatory helpless family so that you could sense the danger a bit more. After all, it\\'s just the end of the world, how could you care if there was no kid in immediate danger ? Oh wait... Still, even that falls flat as their scenes (and they\\'re not the only ones) are filled with incoherent behaviors that were put there just so that the plot can go forward. I attended a screening where the only bursts of joy (or emotions at all) occurred when a new character appeared. Kind of a \"fanboy effect\" that fills you with hope at the sight of one of your beloved comics characters. But the rest of the time, everyone was quite bored and numerous sighs were heard. In a sense, it reassured me as I understood I was not the only one who was disappointed in the movie.*****The following paragraph might contain a minor SPOILER (depending on what you consider a spoiler)***** Plus, something else bothered me. But I know everyone won\\'t agree on this one cause it\\'s kind of a speculation. All the points above still stand even if I\\'m wrong about it. So here it is : Justice League felt like it was a failed attempt to adapt the Avengers in the DCEU. And I\\'m not talking about the strangely similar theme. Nor am I referring to the tension inside the team before they reconcile that felt like a watered-down version of what we saw in the 2012 movie by Whedon. But the characters are bent so that they match their Marvel counterparts. The Flash takes the place of the slightly weaker and wisecracking Hawkeye, Aquaman clearly corresponds to Thor with his royal and out-of-place persona, Wonder Woman goes through the same soldier- leader dilemma as Cap did and even Batman is slightly changed so that he\\'s closer to Tony Stark (making decisions that make absolutely no sense for the world\\'s best detective that we all know and love).

       " 'You have to feel sorry for DC Comics.Sure they\\'ve made more than a bucket load of cash with many of their releases, including of course this year\\'s box office behemoth and critical darling Wonder Woman, but overall the company has been living in the shadows of Marvel for a number of years now and have been late to the party when it comes to superhero team-up events until now.Suffering a troubled production that saw original director Zack Snyder depart the project late in the piece due to a family tragedy and replaced by Avenger\\'s mastermind Joss Whedon, Justice League has had a far from smooth run to cinemas, that includes the fact we\\'ve never truly been properly introduced to its new main players, Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg, with DC keen to get this ensemble together as quickly as possible.Considering all of this, Justice League is not what I\\'d call a \"bad\" movie, in the sense that I\\'d warn everyone against seeing it, but this often jumbled and sometimes just not that interesting blockbuster is still far from the all-round winner DC would\\'ve been hoping for with Snyder and Whedon\\'s film lacking both a genuinely good story arc (new villain Steppenwolf is just generic baddie 101 or even worse) and any true memorable set-pieces or set-ups.At what feels like a fairly brisk 120 minute runtime, Justice League is always on the move as we initially get to witness the first meetings between this collection of new friends (the highlight of which is probably Ezra Miller\\'s pizza eating Barry Allen/The Flash) but with so many people, so many different arcs to play out, Snyder and Whedon struggle to bring it all home and action scenes often feel haphazard, some scenes feel rushed or unwanted (a Russian family is given far too much screen time), while all the films colourful characters don\\'t get the airtime they perhaps needed.After the middling response so far to his take on Batman, Affleck won\\'t be gaining or losing too many supporters here, the verdict is well and truly still out on Cavill\\'s take on Superman, while Gadot is once again great as Wonder Woman. Of the new cast Miller is a fine addition as the awkward Allen, Jason Momoa gives fans hope that his standalone Aquaman will be a lot of fun, while it\\'s surprising just how affecting Ray Fisher is as Cyborg even if his character doesn\\'t seem cut out to get his own standalone feature.It\\'s a shame then that we don\\'t ever feel like this team is given the scenarios they needed to really gel together. There\\'s chemistry to be found here, even Cavill and Affleck benefit from the likes of Gadot and the new additions, their rather tiresome portrayals enlivened by the fresh, energetic nature of their co-stars but overall the film lacks an energy or pizazz that would\\'ve been the kicker to elevate this genuine middle of the road experience to something else entirely.Final Say – All in all huge fans of DC will be kept happy with this sometimes enjoyable, sometimes downright bad big screen culmination of hero\\'s and one badly CGI\\'d and generic villain.Devoid of anything of true note and without a memorable set-piece, Justice League is unquestionably the poor cousin of The Avenger\\'s but with the talented cast involved, there is enough hope here to suggest that this band of hero\\'s have some room to grow into something special if all the stars align.2 1/2 terrorised Russian families out of 5',\n",
       " \"Let's start with the most obvious weakpoint: the villain. Steppenwolf is a laughably bad villain, ripped straight out of a 90ies direct-to-DVD film. He is just a big bland CGI character with absolutely no personality whatsoever. He has no motivation other than being the generic evil guy trying to destroy the world. Apparently it's not even hís plan. If I understood correctly, he's the henchman for some other character that we never learn anything about. His entire design was just uninspired, and he looked and sounded more like a weaker version of the Beast from the live action Beauty and the Beast than one of the strongest characters in the world, hellbend on creating destruction. Then there are the problems with the entire way that DC is approaching these movies. Making this an ensemble movie, just like with Batman v Superman, feels entirely unearned and a cynical attempt to cash in on the widespread brand recognition of Batman and Superman, and to a slightly lesser degree Wonder Woman, and of course the success of Marvel. It's really hard to look at this film and not conclude that this is DC's failed attempt at creating their version of The Avengers. However, whereas The Avengers' meetup felt natural, having been build up throughout its previous 5 movies, Justice League decides to introduce half of the entire league in just this movie. This makes most of the first half of the movie an uneven and boring bunch of random character introductions. Only Wonder Woman and the segments on Themyscira felt natural, because we were already introduced to their culture before and therefore had some connection to them.The rest of the Justice League itself is also lackluster. Jason Momoa's Aquaman was kinda interesting, but it once again feels incredibly cynical that they would introduce the character in this movie instead of in his own one, just because they knew that it would be hard to get people excited for an Aquaman standalone movie without an introduction to the character first. They don't care that it's to the detriment of the quality of this movie, it's just a way too get people to buy into a future film, exactly as they did with Wonder Woman. In this case they actually would have done well to look at Marvel, as they were able to introduce obscure and silly looking/sounding characters like Ant-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy in standalone movies, and make it a critical and commercial success.Cyborg was just boring and uninteresting. He has no personality, there's nothing to his character, because there was not enough time for a proper introduction. Even his suit is making the decisions for him sometimes. The CGI was also quite distracting, as his face looks rather fake.And of course while The Flash has been around for a long time, I find it hard to believe that they would have introduced his character the way they did without the success of Spider-Man in 2016's Civil War. He's pretty much an exact copy of Spider-Man, playing the teenage boy that is overenthuastic about being a superhero, and deriving humor from that.They even found a way to make Batman look uncool. He's pretty much just collecting the team for most of the movie, and does very little on his own. What is most disappointing is that Ben Affleck is never really Bruce Wayne. Whenever you see him dressed normally on screen, it's just him doing Batman stuff without his suit on. Even Wonder Woman has a scene of her being Diana Prince, but it's all only Batman throughout. Then there's Superman, whose return was very poorly done. First of all, if you have a character that is supposedly dead, don't make the actor's name the second one to pop up on the opening credits. That's a surefire way to ruin any potential surprise about his return. Of course that return was inevitable and obvious, but at least put in a little bit of effort to hide that fact. I don't even have to put in spoiler tags in here because DC doesn't even consider his return a spoiler.Secondly, because his return was so quickly - halfway through the chronological follow up to the movie in which he died - there is absolutely no relief or emotional climax to his arc, or any sense of urgency, really. You never really care that Superman's death has supposedly thrown the world in disarray, because his death barely has had any time to have resonated with the viewers. Hell, his supposed death didn't even make it through the end of the previous movie without some hint of his upcoming return. If they had some patience and balls, they would have had him stay dead for a few films, preferably those in which the rest of the Justice League got introduced, and in which the threats get increasingly challenging and hard to overcome due to Superman's absence. This way when he finally does return after the rest of the League is facing a truly frightening and unstoppable enemy, his come-back would feel earned.Overall, there's so much wrong with this movie that although I wrote so much, there are still many flaws left untouched (like Zach Snyder being Zach Snyder doing too many Zach Snyder things, or the nonsensical process of resurrecting Superman that actually put them in more danger than before). It's amazing that after the disaster that was Batman v Superman, they went pretty much the exact same route for its follow-up, setting up an illogical and unearned conflict and resolving it in a cliched and nonsensical manner.At least Batman v Superman had some really cool action scenes instead of the uninteresting CGI fest that was Justice League. And while Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was a terrible villain, I'd take him over the soulless CGI monstrosity that is Steppenwolf any day of the week. Justice League is a terrible movie in every regard, and really does not bode well for the future of DC's cinematic universe.\",\n",
       " \"My rating of 1 does not indicate of how bad the movie quality is rather my disappoint with the ultimate result. My review doesn't comes out as a pure hate machine but rather due to the epic disappointment of one might feel after waiting for so long to witness the most epic team up quite possibly of this century to turn into a mediocre generic film.This should've been the most epic saga in DCEU's continuity but alas rushing to compete with Disney finally took a toll on this franchise. The characters are well enough on their own but their development as individuals are rather paltry. The cinematography is awkward at times as evident from multiple re shoots done by Joss Whedon.The CGI in some parts are terribly glaring to avoid and it feels too much green screen effect that makes your head hurt while watching in a dark room. Some are too bright while some are too dark. The color grading is very inconsistent with the background. As you all know Superman returns from the dead (which is kinda given at this point) but his resurrection isn't handled well enough. What should've been the rekindling of the hope people lost like the Rebirth of a Phoenix is marred by botched character interactions and idiotic dialogues. The supporting characters such as Mera, Martha Kent and Alfred are wasted even further. One of the most highlighting parts of BVS was the interactions between Alfred and Bruce engaging in both morally and logical decisions. Sadly it's been reduced to banal banter between them and others. I'm not going to highlight the humor since it's overdone and doesn't fit organically in this film narrative. Humor is good and should be present but not forced and overstuffed like Disney films recently have become. The villain is generic along with musical score by Danny Elfman which is just rehashing of the same old stuff. Wait for the 4K or bluray release to see edited scenes as consistent with DC's film which might be better.\",\n",
       " 'When you think superhero films, you probably remember such hits as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Avengers. The last thing that comes to mind is any DC movie that has come out in recent years. Many people thought that after the end of the Dark Knight Trilogy that we would see a resurgence in the DC nostalgia that made the company bigger than Marvel at one point. Those hopes were dashed when Man of Steel turned out to be a dark, gritty CGI mess that tried way too hard to be relevant. The moody and drab undertone of the film made us feel to glum to remember the old Saturday morning cartoons that were filled with fun, adventure, and action all rolled into one brilliantly performed show. Next was Batman v Superman which had been hyped for three years, and all we got was eight minutes of fighting and over two hours of talking and exposition that we just didn\\'t care about. Suicide Squad was lacking in the department of character development. Instead the producers wanted big names and flashy effects to sell the movie. That didn\\'t work. Finally, we have this: take all the previous DC movies mentioned (Except the Dark Knight Trilogy, the only films DC got right), put it in a blender while adding aqua man, flash, and cyborg, blend it all together, then turn off the lights. The resulting disaster is Justice League. This is what you don\\'t do with superhero films. It would be like Joss Whedon making the Avengers in 2005 with Iron man being made eight years later.The movie does not follow any of the source material, instead relying on Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot to carry the weight of the film. Everyone else just seems to be along for the ride with none of the other characters getting their own movie yet, so we have no idea what their motivations for joining the Justice League are. The film once again goes into dark and gritty territory with everything happening at once with little to no previously known information about half the main characters. Anyone who isn\\'t a comic book junkie was asking \"Why is there a robot and a fireman in this scene?\" Just another too serious flick that betrays the source material and hopes that big Hollywood names will save it (Spoiler alert: they don\\'t).',\n",
       " \"The second half of the season took a noise dive after Crisis. Full of filler episodes that have not anything to drive the plot forward. We are two episodes away from the finale and the villain is non existent. Lex is there (still) but his manipulations are going nowhere and it looks like the whole plot will be revealed and resolved in the final (with not build up). I don't care for any of the characters this season. Where is the character development for Kelly, Nia, and most importantly Alex? J'onn is phoning it in, William is there contributing nothing and could easily be removed from the season and whatever plot there is would continue as if nothing is missing. Lena who is supposed to have a huge impact is stuck in a lab or following her brother around. Where is the strong character we've seen in seasons past. Kara is especially weak, anyone can beat her in a fight. She's the strongest person on earth and also a genius but she's always losing and never uses her powers. Super hearing, super speed, super strength nah she has none of it. Romance ? Don't worry somebody will be there to tell Kara she likes someone, even if she visibly cringes near that person. At this point the show only continues because it's on the CW and standards are especially low.\",\n",
       " \"Keep in mind that some shows take a while to find themselves. Arrow had the same problem during its first season. Just give the show some time before making any drastic judgements.If there's one things that the pilot has shown us, it's that the CW should handle all DC related TV. They clearly know what they're doing, what with Arrow, Flash and iZombie. CBS already failed with the 1990 version of the Flash, and if they don't do something they're going to kill Supergirl before the show gets a chance to get off the ground.The pilot is cheesy, and ya there are plenty of screw ups, but the overall feel for the show is good. Again, just give the show some time. It may get better, it may get worse. The only way to find out is to watch and hope for the best. The best thing in the series for me is Melissa Benoist.I know this is a rare female lead in a superhero show; but does female empowerment need to be referenced continually? Why can we not have a Ripley or a Sarah Connor where gender is secondary to a character fulfilling a role? You can give it a chance, but it's not a good series. 5/10\",\n",
       " 'Okay, I\\'ve read the reviews too.. My main complaint is that the writers seem to never have read any of the comics. Apparently unfamiliar with what the title \"Super\" refers to, they put an otherwise promising character into the most absurd situations. Supergirl is very nearly as strong as Superman, yes, but she is also just s fast. That means super- speed. Does \"faster than a speeding bullet\" ring a a bell? I watched as Suppergirl just stood by and watched a switch thrown in this last episode, the one used to activate the killing weapon. Just stood there as if she couldn\\'t move. This is just bad writing, you writers. Super- speed, get it? She could have been there before that switch was thrown easily. Think of how the Kryptonians moved in \"Man of Steel,\" or \"Smallville.\" That\\'s how Supergirl should move. Her reflexes match that. It\\'s almost impossible to take any Earth-resident Kryptonian by surprise. So get with it. There are other plot devices which would be infinitely more interesting if writers just dealt with the character\\'s powers instead of hobbling her this way. And, yes, this is written immaturely and unprofessionally. You don\\'t have to write down to kids in the audience. They appreciate the mote intelligent story lines, so give it to \\'em and save everybody the pain of watching these episodes.',\n",
       " 'After all the harsh reviews I\\'ve seen, I decided to actually sign up for this site just to give a more balanced review.First, I won\\'t lie. I\\'m a big time superhero lover. Truth be told, Wonder Woman was my true inspiration when I was younger. I could relate to her and admired her strength and courage. I felt like if she could do anything, so could I. Sure, I was just a kid, but that kind of thing is great for kids.With that said, I feel like this will bring up a new generation of superhero lovers. Everyone basically keeps saying this show is too tropey. But who started those tropes? The classics, of course. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman. These were our go-to since comics existed. Supergirl was later created so that girls could have a feminine figure to admire as well.I feel like so many people are missing the point of this show because they think it\\'s too silly, the writing is too immature, or the plot seems too on-the-nose. But look at it from a new perspective: Can parents see themselves watching this with their children? Arrow shows some rather steamy scenes when that sweet lovin\\' is going on. What are parents doing? \"No, sorry kids, can\\'t watch this.\" But Kara is cute, dorky, and the Everygirl. She wants her boss to be more understanding, she wants to help people, and she always has an encouraging word to say. The most important thing -- she values her friends. What better lesson to teach your kids in a modern age? And for those who are kids at heart, it\\'s still an enjoyable show. There\\'s a great cast with lots of people we recognize (at least I recognize several). It reminds me of my youth and why I loved superheroes to begin with. She\\'s a *clothed* feminine figure who isn\\'t relying on the size of her chest or butt to show how capable she is. Wasn\\'t that the biggest complaint of all scifi and fantasy? Now, anyone who remembers the classic Disney movie, Hercules, and loved it regardless of what age they are, I feel like that\\'s the movie that best describes this show. I was young enough to appreciate it, and I\\'ve even re-watched it out of nostalgia a few times. The more I think of a dorky person who didn\\'t know their own abilities, including that inner heroic capability, the more I see a parallel between that movie and Supergirl 2015. Both wanted to be more. Both wanted to find a purpose in life. Both found it by being a hero and saving others.For people who missed that 90s happy campy nature, I feel like this show brings it back, but without feeling like an entire \"camping\" trip. Having also seen Arrow, Flash, and Gotham, Supergirl show is worthy of all ages. I just believe people need to give Supergirl a chance. Like any show, it will find that \"groove\" and improve. We\\'ve barley even started.',\n",
       " \"I am not one to go out of my way to write a bad review; I'd generally prefer not to spend any more time than necessary on a terrible terrible show. For Supergirl I make an exception for two reasons: I am too disappointed not to, and I simply can't help but feel obligated to echo the sentiments of many other disappointed comic book fans. I'll explain...Although I like the actors for Supergirl, Kat, and Winn, I am less than thrilled with pretty much every other. Mechad Brooks is a badass and absolutely cut out for a killer role in a super hero movie but that is exactly why he should not be Jimmy Olsen... Jimmy is a scrawny nerd and that's the way I like him. The rest of the characters just seem too contrived with the exception of a few cameo characters I could love in anything. Yet, admittedly, I'm not convinced that the issues are because of the characters they cast or because of the incompetence of the writers and directing team.My most severe problems with Supergirl are the story lines and scripts. Riddled with political agenda topics, whiny and jealous main characters, and childish fights, the show has left me cringing so bad for three whole seasons that I'm ashamed to admit I've watched as much as I have. The only reason I've made it this far is because of a deep- rooted loyalty to DC and a misguided hope that the writers would figure out what isn't working. I've given up hope. I will not be continuing on past he third season with anything short of replacement of the writing team and/or director. I truly hope that happens...\",\n",

And here also you will not get bored while watching this whole season.There are plenty of twists that made it much more nicer. 10/10 🔥\\nSeason 3- This starts with flashbacks too with main story going on. That part was nice but the ending was not so good. I was hoping for a different type of ending but it was same like other series . This season was having so much potential for a good season but in the end they really failed to give what I was expecting.\\n8/10 for season 3.\\nSeason 4 - So I have completed season 4 and it was actually nice.People hated this season for no reason and yes there was some downers but this season is all about good plot and good action scenes . The ending was nice too. The fours seasons are actually nice. 9/10 😊\\nSeason 5- I hate the starting of this season . Why they need to add more members in team when there is enough of members already there.But actually this season was much better than last two seasons and the return of some people make it superb . Loved the last two episodes. 10/10 again\\nSeason 6 - So the hate for this season is not real. Yes , there were some disappointments too but it's all about how much you love arrow from starting and yes the plot was good. The people saying Oliver got beaten up by a thug are just a bunch of haters who don't like the plot. The ending was surprising too .Hats off.Good season but not so great.

So 4/10 .You literally failed this season...\\nSeason 8- So the best part of this season was it's length but the worst part is to add that crisis multiverse in it . There isn't any need of that but the creative of this show really failed this season and the plot makes no sense now. There are alot of things you can only understand If you have watched crisis on earth . The story was going in a right way but they literally spoiled it in 8th episode.

       " \"This show isn't perfect, there is no such thing, but I thoroughly enjoyed every storyline this show tackled. I definitely favor certain characters and storylines over others, but taking it as a whole, I loved it from start to finish.A lot of people hate on this show, taking issues with the writing, acting, special effects, etc. But considering the limitations set in place by DC Comics as well as budgetary limitations, this show holds up.The fact that this show successfully kept its fanbase on its toes for EIGHT SEASONS and lead the way for multiple other DC series to take off (The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, and Black Lightning to name a few). Sure, Smallville takes the credit for starting the superhero craze, but Arrow created an even bigger universe and brought so many more DC characters to life.This show is worth the watch, I don't care what anyone says. Again, it's not for everybody, and it's not a perfect telling of the story of the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen. But I think people should give it the due credit it deserves. Without Arrow, there wouldn't be an Arrowverse.\",\n",
       " 'Let\\'s take a moment of mourning for the TV plot arcs of yore. Back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and, if indeed there was action, it took place precisely in the last 7 minutes of the episode, and was all done with before the close, giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter, close down the storyline, and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet. How many TV shows followed that formula I cannot say, but the number was in the 100s. Now all that has changed. You can now have action many times in the body of a show, it is permitted, even encouraged. And you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed. All this is positive evolution I think. But here the catch. There are no more \"closed\" story-lines. In the multi-band, multi-channel, multi-device electronic age, where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird, nighttime TV has astonishingly borrowed the Rule Book of daytime soap operas and, lo!, plots never actually resolve, they just become more complex. ARROW is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic-book-derived drama, arguably as good as or even better than SMALLVILLE (which was, thematically, all over the map). Amell is great. He has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting. The supporting cast is great. In fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a \"10\" are the flashbacks. They are terrible. They are like some silent Hell the viewers must go through to get back to the actual episodes. It is almost as if the lead writer, as a small child, was locked in a closet with a DVD looping KUNG FU, and grew up to believe that you cannot advance 10 minutes of plot in the present, without 2 minutes of flashback to fortify it.',\n",

       " \"I used to really like The CW's DC Comics TV Universe, better known as the 'Arrowverse', as the first couple seasons of Arrow as well as the first(and most of) the second season of The Flash were fantastic; the first seasons of Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow being solid; and everything after in at either 'alright' to 'meh' to 'pretty poor'. The yearly crossover events are still kind of fun though...I'd be lying to say that I am not at all interested in what Crisis on Infinite Earths is going to present. However, the longer the keep growing it the less the creative higher ups appear to care about good storytelling and trying to work best with their restrictive budgets and instead focus on just pandering to certain political ideologies and try hard to be 'hip' and 'trendy'...What were once very solid superhero programming have become bland, flat, and generally uninteresting. I am of the opinion they should probably stop with this year's big crossover event and Arrow's finale but it looks like they want to milk the cow more...Sadly, Batwoman, the newest entry in the universe, does not reignite interest.I will start off with the good(which is very few); both Dougray Scott and Rachel Skarsten are great as Kate Kane's father Jacob and Alice. The color grading is effective and definitely gives the series its own identity(accompanied with a tighter, more cinematic aspect ratio and use of wide angle lenses). The music is fine too, though fairly generic. That's pretty much it though. Now the bad:1. The character of Kate Kane is written as very cold and uninteresting and Ruby Rose plays her as such on screen. She was fine in Elseworlds, but it seems that that presentation was the beginning and the end of her personality, or lack thereof as a character. Rose also struggles a lot trying to fake an American accent, and sounds pretty much the same in tone no matter what is needed for a scene.2. The action is fairly poor. I understand this is TV and you only have a short period to choreograph and record on camera but come on anything here can be easily done by the average person with much less of the budget. Nothing is uniquely staged or reveals anything about the characters and how they handle such dramatic situations.3. The flashbacks. My goodness whoever made the decision to edited it that way should probably be let go from their job, you can barely make out what is going on because of how jittery and overblown the image quality is. It adds nothing to the story and is just an annoyance.4. Politics over story. Okay we get it she's a tough female who is highly skilled and her romantic interests are for those of her own gender, that's all great but when you keep hammering that in every couple of minutes it just gets tiresome and shows that the producers probably do not understand the character of Kate Kane beyond a surface level description. Batwoman is a very complex character with a rich history, but this does not appear to be made by actual fans but those who would rather like to use them to pander to a few people on Twitter.5. Disrespecting one hero to make the heroine better. It seems that the producers of this show really want to make it seem like Batman isn't such a good hero to begin with and want to make Batwoman out to be the real hero Gotham always needed, this totally disrespects the source material and Bruce and Kate's relationship.Unless the rest of the season is a major improvement I see this as being another nail in the coffin of the once fine Arrowverse, and it might also bring the hammer along with it too.\",\n",
       " \"This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had a moment to shine in Thanos' story.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly.

The minute you think you really get a character, something is thrown at them to make you and them have to reevaluate and grow.The technicalities of the show are amazing and because it's so on point (I believe what actual service men and women have said about it's accuracy since I never served), it makes it easier to see the characters and team dynamic. I'm less distracted by occasional bad CGI moments because the intensity of the moment is from the action and the emotion. There's some great acting at work here, and it leaves room for a lot of thought from a regular citizen's perspective.I came for the action and excitement, I stayed for the realistic acting and character development. I just want to see how Jason, Ray, Sonny, Clay and co. are gonna handle the next hurdle. Whether it's emotional or tactical.PS, the jargon aspect is so fun.

After watching the first film, however, I definitely will seek out some of the other material, as I enjoyed the film quite a bit--it earns an 8 out of 10 from me. At this point, however, I can\\'t compare it to any other instantiations of Mortal Kombat.The film is basically a combination of a classic Hong Kong-styled martial arts actioner and a fantasy that leans slightly to the horror side of that genre. To the film\\'s benefit, it\\'s also not something that either director Paul W.S. Anderson or writer Kevin Droney take too seriously--the film is ultimately an adaptation of a popular video game, after all. There is a tongue-in-cheek, slightly campy sense of humor and playful cheesiness throughout the film, the humor being primarily fueled from two characters, Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert). True, Lambert has a kind of almost smarmy campiness to anything he says or does, in any film, but for me, that\\'s part of his attractiveness--it\\'s a large part of what sold me on the Highlander films.The fantasy aspect was something I didn\\'t expect before watching the film. It was a very pleasant surprise. Being a huge horror fan, I was especially taken with the set design. The fantasy characters, such as Goro, and the fantasy traits of other characters, were well done and even subtle at times.As for the fights, which are the propelling force behind the film, they\\'re pleasantly varied and well choreographed, although having just watched Master of the Flying Guillotine (1975) again recently, I was slightly disappointed that the fights weren\\'t more brutal and gory (and in fact, this is one of the areas where I subtracted a point). But they almost make up for the lack of violence but their imaginativeness, especially the fights with Sub-Zero and The Scorpion.

No need to tell anything except a few things... a few good things. The acting crew is great - Robin Shou (Liu Kang), Linden Ashby (Johny Cage) and Bridgette Willson (Sonya Blade) were great in their parts. Robin Shou is not the best actor around, but he proved to be great as Liu Kang and I find him, for now, to be the best who portrayed Kang in live action film. Linden Ashby was an excellent choice for Johny Cage. He was funny, cocky and sarcastic as a character, and I think that Ashby did a great job. Bridgette Willson was OK, but not all that great. Maybe because they give her so little to work with. And when it comes to that, our leading characters are not that much developed. They are just there to win the tournament, but their backgrounds are pretty solid, and that\\'s about it. Too bad that they didn\\'t give them more to their character. Christopher Lambert was fine as Rayden, mysterious and tall. But his acting was a bit wooden. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was excellent was Shang Tsung, his performance was inspiring and he made Tsung with such unmitigated charisma. So far, he is my favorite Shang Tsung. Talisa Soto (Kitana) was also good, alas just like Sonya, little developed and two dimensional. She was there to increase the plot for Liu Kang. Now, the one I really found most entertaining is none else than Trevor Goddard (Kano), his Kano was very fun! His Australian accent and charm were just through the roof! To mention the fact that most voice actors in video games based their performances on Goddard\\'s. Thanks to him, this Kano is memorized and trademarked forever. Love this Kano! The martial artist that played Reptile (Keith Cooke), Sub Zero (Francois Petit) and Scorpion (Chris Casamassa) were amazing in what they do best - kicking some butt! They really gave a 200% effort and hard work in fight scenes. Fights are excellent, dynamic and well choreographed. The atmosphere in certain scenes is good, in a way, it gives us a decent impressions of \"fighting locations.\" The locations and studio sets were good, CGI, was not that great. But, don\\'t despair. One of the most beautiful things in this film is Goro. Performed by special effects master and student to Stan Winston - Tom Woodruff Jr. Who did an impressive job on Goro. You just can\\'t deny his puppetry and animatronics. All that is pretty well mixed with voice acting of Kevin Michael Richardson who voiced Goro. For the end, Paul WS Anderson is not my favorite director, nor I don\\'t find most of his films good. But, this one is very special and it was one of his early works in Hollywood, so he had to prove it. And he did it. He did a good job. Keep it in mind that this movie offers you only a tiny amount of blood. Whereas the game is extremely violent. This movie, reasonably is not. It\\'s a decent fun! Watch it!',\n",
       " \"I've always believed that video-games will never make good movies. But Warner don't seem to understand what a goldmine they're sitting on when it comes to Mortal Kombat. The franchise has so many characters, complex back-stories, and mythology that it honestly dwarfs the X-Men. There is a huge amount of potential in Mortal Kombat. This juvenile 1995 effort only scratches the surface of that potential, but still manages to be an enjoyable no-brainer.I remember when this was released back in October 1995. It had been No. 1 at the US box office for three straight weeks. The audience did actually manage to go along with the silly, tongue-in-cheek hokum, and it worked. By modern standards this film is laughably awful. The CGI effects look like they were rendered on a Commodore 64, even when the technology to make much better was readily available at the time. I feel so old thinking about how dated and retro Mortal Kombat is.A bunch of muscular tough-guys are called to an exotic island to take part in a fighting tournament that could decide the fate of the planet. The Outworld Emperor wants Earth as his new dominion and is one tournament away from victory. His mortal, demonic minions, led by the brilliantly over-the-top Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa as dark sorcerer Shang Tsung, must fight Earth's toughest warriors. All but three are expendable: Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade. The film follows them as they fight their way through many colorful environments.It looks and feels very much like an old-fashioned kung-fu movie. The production design is frequently wonderful, and there's hardly any unlikeable characters. Even 4-armed Prince Goro (brought to life by lovely puppetry) is fun to watch. The story however is paper-thin. Like I said, it could be so much more but the talent or motivation to make such a film in 1995 just wasn't there.I've never been a fan of Paul Anderson (as a matter-of-fact, he's one of the worst filmmakers currently working), but his US debut is a fun, little pot-boiler with some funky 90s techno.\",\n",
       " 'The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie.Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro.2. Scorpion has his iconic \"Get over here!\" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands.3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game.4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones.5. Three words: Johnny Cage\\'s nutshots.Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven\\'t played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible.2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn\\'t Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved.Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn\\'t drag out for a long excessive period of time.2. The acting wasn\\'t mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games \"should\" be made. I put \\'should\\' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie.3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he\\'s best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal).Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film\\'s CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect.2. The costumes weren\\'t bad, but they weren\\'t as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn\\'t look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that\\'s why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous.3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It\\'s understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That\\'s not something I would usually say, but hey, it\\'s Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality.Despite the cons and differences it doesn\\'t make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It\\'s all around pretty good, could have been better, but I\\'m still fine by what I received.',\n",
       " 'Mortal Kombat (1995) is my favorite martial arts sci-fi action classic flick based on a video game that I have grown up! I grew up playing Mortal Kombat II video game, I played in a hospital with my friends. I heard about Street Fighter (1994) movie that played Jean-Claude Van Damme in it and that time I thought that movie is one of the best Van Damme movies, that just come out recently in the 90\\'s but boy was I wrong! Street Fighter sucks ass! Jean-Claude Van Damme sucked ass in Street Fighter! Mortal Kombat is the opposite of that film, I love this film to death and it is my favorite Paul W. S. Anderson film that he ever directed! In my honest opinion I think is the best video game movie ever made, that was before Resident Evil movies were made! I love the theme song Techno-Syndrome (7inch mix) by The Immortals! I love this movie to death it is a classic my favorite childhood movie of all time!! Too bad it got a sequel 1997 and ruined this movie. This in my opinion is a classic Sci-Fi underrated martial arts flick that I love it so damn much!!! \"A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?\"Plot: Three unknowing martial artists are summoned to a mysterious island to compete in a tournament whose outcome will decide the fate of the world.\"Nothing in this world has prepared you for this.\" Summoned to a mysterious island, three martial arts warriors engage in the ultimate battle of good against evil -the supernatural tournament of Mortal Kombat. Starring Christopher Lambert (Higlander), Talisa Soto (Don Juan DeMarco) and featuring world class martial arts champion Robin Shou (Tiger Cage II), it\\'s the most awesome, action-jammed, reality-shattering adventure the Universe has ever witnessed! In this movie we have a beautiful cast as Christopher Lambert from Highlander, Linden Ashby, Bridgette Wilson, Robin Shou from Tiger Cage II and Beverly Hills Ninja, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as the bad guy, every time I watch a movie from the 90\\'s, I see this guy in it been a bad guy! Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was a perfect choice for playing the bad guy sorcerer Shang Tsung, who killed Liu Kang\\'s brother. I absolutely love this film, it is my childhood film, I love the fight choreography in this movie, the plot and story was really great. I really like the special visual practical effects and the fight choreographer did a decent job showing those martial arts. It has a beautiful ending, a beautiful song to the movie, I love the fight scenes with Johnny Cage and Scorpion and it is the best one in the movie, the fight scene between Liu Kang and Reptile is perfect the second best martial arts scenes. This is an awesome movie and the games are incredible. That has the REAL Mortal Kombat song. This is a film that is actually about martial arts tournament, it has a great characters. Johnny Cage is my favorite character of all time! Linden Ashby was so great and excellent as Johnny Cage I wish he would play more roles like he did his character. I really love this movie one of the most underrated 90\\'s movies, I really enjoy and love this film it is fun flick to watch and I grew up with it! Overall: I own this movie on Blu-ray and I absolutely love this movie! I used to had on VSH both of the movies that my mom bought me Mortal Kombat: Annihilation on my wish list and I love this one but Annihilation was such a disappointment I hate that movie. I also don\\'t get why this movie got so many hate? I love this film and I don\\'t agree with critics and haters with this film! I think your wrong this movie get\\'s 10 out of 10!

       " 'Mortal Kombat is by no means an intelligent film. It isn\\'t deep either, and the martial arts aren\\'t especially original, overly impressive or violent,  but it\\'s an amazingly enjoyable film. From start to finish I sat bolt upright almost forgetting to blink taking in the action, loud techno and dodgy one-liners. As a huge fan of the Mortal Kombat game series since I was a kid, this film meant a lot to me. It was everything I wasted the last five years with on the big screen with real humans and inevitable cash-ins. It even came complete with quotes straight from the game such as \"Finish him!\", \"Get over here!\" and \"Flawless Victory\" as spoken by the head programmer, Ed Boon himself. The narrative itself is extremely simple, with classic binary oppositions of good vs evil and regular humans vs freaks and sorcerers. It\\'s Earthrealm vs Outworld in an adrenaline pumping tournament ripped straight out of Enter the Dragon. There\\'s nothing cinematically brilliant about this experience, it\\'s just put excitement, perfect for watching with a group of friends or on a late hyperactive night. Definitely a film for fans of the series and people who spent too much time on the Sega when they were younger!',\n",
       " \"OK the plot isn't great, but luckily for this film it doesn't really require one, as the senseless fighting and violence makes up for it. some of the fights are extraordinary! especially the fight between scorpion and johnny cage, it's a superb fight and contains some of the best martial arts i have ever seen, also the fight between liu kang and reptile is very good.some of the scenes are very well made and the special effects are superb considering when it was made. i have already mentioned it but the fight between scorpion and cage is good enough reason to watch this film, it is so well made and is just superb viewing, also some of the other fights including kang and sub zero, kang and reptile and kang and shang sung also help this film great entertainment.all in all this film is just loads of fun and is great for martial art fans and for some good Friday night entertainment.\",\n",
       " \"Watching this video game adaptation again 26 years after its original release I must say it was aging well. I'm honestly impressed by the care that was put into set design and the art involved. The costumes are very authentic and the characters are nicely portrayed. All fight scenes work perfectly and especially after the first half the choreography gets wilder and draws you even further into the game world. I have to remorse claiming this is one of the best game-based movies and also the fight scenes are more enjoyable than most of the modern productions. There is a lot of hand-made art involved. Even the characters develop nicely throughout the film. Paul W. S. Anderson made another classic. However he wasn't involved in the sequel but from what I've heard of MK-Annihilation he and other crew members disliked the follow-up. The first movie was assembled ambitiously and set the bar for future things to come.I didn't know Christopher Lambert was the most expensive actor on set but he must have been charming and such a nice guy. I read that in the trivia section. Be sure to check that out after watching the movie.\\nNow let the games begin...again!\",\n",
       " 'I sometimes \"test\" TV-show concepts for fun and this has got to be one of the stupidest shows ever now.They arrive at a crime scene all the characters have dialogue by standing in a circle saying one line each clockwise. They get back to office using large holographic mega TV-displays with drag and drop functions never seen in reality. The \"plots\" evolve either by them getting access to info in their mega-computer or by letting the computer nerd genius in the series provide them a new clue.This is show might be the prime example (at least from what I have seen) of lazy screen writing on mainstream network TV crime shows today.The of these writers are to be politically correct and that\\'s it. They don\\'t care if they ruin the show in the process.Do not, I repeat do not waste your time with this anymore!',\n",

       " \"Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money.\",\n",
       " \"You could practice with your hands for exactly the same amount of hours, but that still wouldn't make you Liberace. Some people, whether its cooking, tennis, or snooker, seem to put balls in pockets with ease. And so it is with some actors.In this film, High Grant and Colin Farrell shine, and they have some big hitters around them.If you've seen a Guy Ritchie film before, you know exactly what you are getting. Fast edits, narrative overlay in slow motion, punchy dialogue with multiple storylines, and this film does the usual. In some ways its directing style detracts from the film as a whole. Static camera, actors on their marks, quick shots, twenty cuts, fast speaking, and Ritchie letting you know you are watching a Ritchie film. But I still like it.And the reason was Hugh and Colin. They shine in every scene, no matter where they are in the shot, you cant help but look at them, If there is a sequel, make it about these two, the Sutch and Bumdance of London, and it will win everything.\",\n",
       " \"When all the critic reports come out and the inevitable 'mediocre' scorings appear don't be worried: this is a very good film and Ritchie is back to his best.Snatch is a favourite of mine and I must say that this film surpasses it, in story, tone and cinematography. The twists are good, the jokes are great but what stands out are the performances. A 'star studded cast' seems to be the highlight of every movie nowadays but let me tell you, the majority of the performances in this film are oscar worthy and pure gold. I say majority of course because Jeremy Strong enlisted one of the worst acting performances I've seen this decade!It is by far a better tribute to cinema than that 'Once upon a time' nonsense and I urge you to see this film.The only drawback for me is the third act. Too many pipes are introduced late in the film which contributes to a somewhat lacklustre and crammed finale. But apart from that a solid film.\",\n",
       " 'I was excited to discover this week that season 3 was available on NetFlix. I was a little surprised, though, when I had to enter a NetFlix access code to watch it.I\\'m part-way through episode 1 of season 3. Apparently they have decided to move the show to a TV-MA rating by lacing it with frequent and totally gratuitous profanity (GD, F* S*). And it\\'s from every single character. (Even the President\\'s daughter uses the S* word in casual conversation with her dad. Really??)Memo to NetFlix:\\nLacing a show with profanity cheapens it--always. No exceptions. Maybe in your Hollywood bubble, you believe that nearly everyone wants to hear this sort of language for entertainment. And I\\'m sure you justify it with rationalizations like \"Hey, that\\'s real life.\" Well, maybe it is among some segments of society--and I\\'m not naive enough to think that our corrupt politicians don\\'t speak that way. However, I have spent many years in the corporate world and I can tell you that it is still regarded--thankfully--as unprofessional to speak that way in the workplace.I understand that, compared to much of the smut that passes for entertainment these days this is extremely mild. However, the show at a TV-14 rating and gained it\\'s audience based on programing at that rating. If this sort of language had been used in Season 1, Episode 1, I would never have started watching the series. I have now invested 2 seasons of my time in the show, and you have changed it. Sorry, whether you admit it or not, you have abandoned a significant segment of your target audience. It is not loyal to your customers to suddenly switch to offensive content after you have them \"hooked.\" Your marketing research may have indicated that this change would grow your market. Sadly, it may very well do so. However, regardless of the consequences, the change you have made is immoral. Immoral because of the content itself, and immoral because it is disloyal to your dedicated viewers. Count me a one of your lost fans.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve just binge watched it up to the end of Episode 18. The initial premise is interesting, whether or not it\\'s actually based in reality. You always need to grant some leeway with \"initial premises\", especially these days. I stopped watching 24 after the second season because I found it too infantile and silly. I did watch The West Wing through to the end. This is a sort of 24 meets The West Wing. The show lets itself down with too many loving gazes between the President and his wife (does she have any flaws at all?), some terribly clunky lines and worst of all, the relentless US Patriot, buzz word laden speeches. \"The American people deserve...\". \"Rebuilding our amazing nation...\". \"Rebuilding our fantastic Government\". There\\'s no mention of lobbyists or Corporate involvement in Government. There\\'s no mention of the profound disconnect between citizen and Government that is a feature of contemporary politics. The various \"third rails\" of US politics are briefly mentioned. It is a show about a fantasy America and a fantasy American Government. It\\'s the TV Show version of America that is challenged by the initial events and it responds the way TV Show script writers think such a world would respond. Having said all that, it moves reasonably quickly and the split between the two story arcs is well handled and engaging. The only caveat is - if you find \"true blue, Mom and Apple Pie American sentimental patriotism\" too much to bear, you\\'re going to struggle with this show. But it\\'s probably worth bearing with, all in all. There are far, far worse shows on TV.',\n",
       " \"As a watcher of Supernatural, my eye caught this series because of Jared Padalecki. He was a fine partner to Jenson Ackles in 'Supernatural', although perhaps he isn't as strong an actor. I love him anyway. I gave this a shot since he was starring in the show, and because it is a remake of the classic 'Walker Texas Ranger' of yesteryear.But sadly I was irritated through most of the first episode. It largely focussed on forced drama and family drama elements that you usually won't see in a pilot episode. What I want to see is some action, tension, thrills, and a goal for the season. I want that set up in the first episodes so I know what I'm in for, even if only hinted at. If his wife dies in the first 2 scenes, then is this show not supposed to be about Walker getting revenge, finding out who/why? This event seems to have made no impact on the character by halfway through the episode, just a forgotten fact that isn't relevant to the plot.Here also the timelines were very confusing for me. The current status of Walker, his wife (did she die in the first 3 minutes of screen time?); the time skips, the family reunions. I don't know, it was all too much.The casework that Walker is thrown into was very light on the material, even Supernatural gave us more case work, crime scene analysis, and detective work than this show did. The crime that Walker was working on in this episode was glossed over and I have no idea what was happening. After greeting his new partner on the scene in the morning, they immediately cut to a lunch date scene with these two (romance plot?). I'm sitting there blank expression thinking what the heck is this show, and who is it for?The music was too numerous with different songs playing at every moment. I felt this completely drowned every scene, and was too teenage angsty and manipulative for my ears.A note on the camera work; sometimes it was competent, most of the time too wobbly and the editing with too many takes and cuts. Something that the 'Supernatural' production team were completely on point with was the music, the audio, the camerawork, and the editing. In this show there is nothing.I won't be watching the rest of the season, it seems to be aimed at teenage girls; and sadly nothing like 'Walker Texas Ranger' or 'Supernatural' for that matter.3/10 poor storytelling, bad editing, too much family drama, no plot or sense of where the season is going; and poor audio/music. Jared was fine but this production isn't good enough for him in my opinion.\",\n",
       " 'The pilot is choppy and forced. The flow is all o er the place like they are trying to get all the drama connections done in episode 1. Or some sort of new tv show where the drama is played out at 300% speed.Show seems to dance all over raw edges of white cop privilege and the very one else hating cops. Lacks the finesse of shows like The Rookie.The plot just just seemed so forcefully fast and all over the place.The family dynamic is my least favorite part of show by far. I am really hoping that the show does not turn into Blue Bloods where one families dinner table rules a city.And everyone seems to mumble. Almost to the point I need to turn on subtitles.I think if the show settles down. Literally slows down and focuses better in the plot/script it might be a 6.5 show. And hopefully is less cliche in the family dynamics.So far it feels like they took a New York cop show, doubled the show speed to a frenetic pace and made all the white people talk with a sock in their mouth, dressed up the stages like a southern farm to make it feel like Texas. Everyone else is clearly spoken and I almost wish they were the main cast. As they are more interesting charactersBut I get that a cop show in the south can be a hard one to show in this day and age with current topics. So hopefully in the first half of the season or so they can find their pace and a good vision to work with',\n",

I'm not a fan of wild West/cowboy shows (except for the brilliant Alias Smith and Jones back in the 80s) and find that I generally avoid TV cop procedurals. I never watched the original Walker TR so I'm not comparing it to that. The sole reason I tuned in was to see how Jared Padalecki performed after leaving Supernatural, a show I watched from the very beginning and loved.Now that's out of the way, I can say that I've struggled through two episodes of Walker and I am bailing out. I always try to give a show the benefit of the doubt and give it at least two episodes to get going but this one really doesn't deserve a third. There are too many other decent TV programmes out there to waste any more of my time on this one.The dialogue cannot be heard properly over the extremely loud and unnecessary music. I would have turned the subtitles on if I were more interested in what was actually going on on the screen but it is mind numbingly boring. Nothing ever really happens. It's all too predictable and dull and as others have already said, it's cliche after cliche after cliche.Sorry Jared, I know this is your special project but it's just awful.

Not \"showing\". Every scene rolls by like a collection of random cliche moments lifted from any and every tv show before it. The characters are cookie-cutter archetypes placed before us like generically paper dolls.... Angry & troubled daughter who\\'s just mad at daddy for not being around? Check. Overly assertive junior partner who just \"shows him who\\'s really boss\"? Yup Understanding mom who (was too damn boring to listen to) I mean.... so comforting & understanding. For sure. Father? Ditto. Tough boss (Coby Bell who I love) who \"tells it like it is\". - Yawn.Then there is Walker (Jason Padalecki) , who is \"so damn sad & all tore up inside\" about the death of a wife that we have no emotional attachment to. Why should we? We have barely seen her on the screen for 15 seconds. By the time she dies, viewers are still trying to figure out who the characters are, who they relate to, which ones to care about & what the bloody plot is. - Punctuate that with the tired movie trope \"scream heard round the world\". Arrrggggghhhh. (pfft).Seven minutes into the Pilot and I complained (aloud) that \"Twenty minutes in and they\\'re still bouncing around with no plot or purpose. Why am I watching this?\" To which my partner replied, \"It\\'s only been 7:15\". - UGH.By the end of this, it is obvious that there is no chemistry between Walker & his kids. It actually felt creepy.So how is the procedural cop portion? Non existent. (I don\\'t count the 15 seconds of \"nabbing the bad guy\" at the end as either action or interesting). It\\'s just tacked on. It also made NO sense. For one thing; Cops can\\'t just steal stuff from someone\\'s business and break it open to magically find evidence that allows them to go back & tell them what they found. HONESTLY, even a jaded 16yr old has got to know that\\'s ridiculous.Writing in an illegal search in order to rush the story ahead does not make Walker a hero. It makes the writers idiots.Hard PASS on episode two.',\n",
       " \"I LOVE this show, LOVE it, its just the shot in the arm TV needs, its the complete antithesis of most of the other American shows we get here in the UK and its such a welcome contrast.There are some superb TV shows on offer at the moment, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, genre shows like Dexter, Tru Blood and Walking Dead, all diverse, all excellent top draw entertainment.Its the success of these shows that makes Five-0 such a great alternative, its fast paced, funny, has plenty of crash, bang, wallop and it looks great.A guilty pleasure you say ? NO, this exactly what TV should be doing, offering choice, i hate reality and talent shows with every fibre of my being, but they cater to people who do like them, so i feel that i deserve an action packed cop show now and again.Choice is the key factor in everything we do for recreation today, TV like it or not is a big part of peoples recreation, so its right that it should be offering a diversity of shows that appeal to all tastes.As to the issue of remakes/boots, whatever, this tired argument ran out of steam on Battlestar Galactica, i ranted against the new one, then sat and watched it and realised that, you can like both, the hypocrisy cops are not going to kick your door down. If you like it, good, if you don't like it, good, but ranting about the revisiting of classics is like arguing with the weather. I used to watch the original Five-0 here in the UK (Saturday nights, ITV, late on) loved it, but i can find some room for the new one too.This show has to get a second series, this is flat out brilliant TV, in the middle of a worldwide recession, political and social upheaval rife, the upbeat, take no prisoners, ass kicking note of Hawaii's favourite Five-0 unit is just the tonic.\",\n",
       " \"I was a huge fan of the original Hawaii Five-O, so when I heard about this attempt at a new show, I was excited but skeptical at the same time. Would it be just another CSI, or would it be different? Would it deserve to be called 'Hawaii Five-O'? Well, I must say...I LOVE it! First of all, the show is NOT just another CSI. It's different...it's funny...all in all, it's refreshing. Steve and Danno's bantering with each other is hilarious...very normal and realistic. There are some differences regarding the character's lives, but that's fine, as long as every episode has the spirit that it's had so far.As for the actors...Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan are perfect. I can't imagine anyone else having their roles. Daniel Dae Kim is fine in his role...the only problem I have is with Grace Park. It seems unbelievable that her character would land a job like this, fresh out of police academy and with no real police experience...not to mention that she looks 15 years old. Oh well.I haven't missed a single episode, and eagerly await it every week!\",\n",
       " \"Actors: Main 3 are cookie cutter, nearly identical birth years. I like that they're in their 30's and not all 90210 on viewers. Storyline: Definitely an action show, and it's done adequately. Script: Solid. Some cheesy stuff, some wow stuff, some well acted scenes. A few roll your eyes moments, but that keeps in part with the way the original was. Pros: The script writing. The acting. The actors aren't Hollywood good-looking. But they are a good match with the scripts. Subtle little moments of humour, that you have to see visually and/or hear. Something ha ha will be thrown in there when you least expect it. The building of the characters. You find out little bits here and there and already starting to get a better understanding of how a character is the way he or she is. Cons: The filming of a fight sequence, taking on the bad guys was terrible. That's not a spoiler. You'd fully expect to see one, seeing as it was in a huge amount of TV commercials. It sucks because you can see the distance between them, when they are at blows with each other. The editing is a shambles, it's so crappy in the action sequences. Could be much better. Hire more qualified people, it's worth it. The believability of some legal situations are a bit dodgy. That detracts, and makes it a little hard to buy into it. But then again it is not a documentary. It's a TV show that's there to entertain you. Watch yourself a reality show like Cops if you're going to harp on it. Summarily. My take: I like it because it's fresh. The camaraderie reminds me (a little) of: some Starsky and Hutch, a dash of 21 Jump Street, and yes the feel of the original Hawaii Five-O is there. It's on location on beautiful Oahu, with little studio time in it. Outdoors: That's just how they roll on that island.\",\n",
       " \"When has a sequel approached or surpassed the brilliance of the original concept? Rarely, in fact I cannot think of a single instance. But seriously, when you make a sequel you should at least be a fan...force the writers to watch a season of DVDs so they at least have a clue. This is SO bad I don't even want to waste time on writing this intelligently.In short, the characters are jokes...just some actor wannabes that no on the street would recognize, have no stage presence or unique personality or star gravitas. A quick example STEVE McGARRETT...he is and always will be JACK LORD no one can fill the shoes of the former Navy Commander. When I watch this young inexperienced punk say he is Steve McGarrett I wince...I shake my head...I wonder what the hell the writers and casting director were thinking. Yeah this no name actor is Steve McGarrett like I am Frank Sinatra...the guy playing the current Steve McGarrett couldn't put a pimple on Steve McGarrett's badge.Thank GOD DVDs of the original episodes are available...with a 4K upconverter and a 4K LED projector I can watch the real Hawaii Five-O. Wow, how is it possible that the automobiles and scenery are better on the original fifty year old series??? Next time you want to make a sequel forget your trendy writers and get a few true hard core fans of the show to advise you. On the current series I honestly don't know and don't care who is who. At least the Asian woman is gorgeous.\",\n",
       " 'I can\\'t say enough good about this show and its actors. All four of the major characters were well chosen and show a great range of emotions, allowing for considerable character development. In one episode, we learn more about where all four of them than we did in the original series from 1968-80. Their acting ability and range would allow for big screen versions of the show.Instead of the squeaky clean and unrealistic, monotone characters of the original series, all of these people have \"issues\" related to the complexities and problems of modern life: long distance moves, job stress, living away from family members, political problems.The plots of each episode move very quickly, and I am able to pick up new things watching an episode a second time.While the pilot and first few episodes didn\\'t take advantage of the beautiful backdrop of Hawaii quite enough, they sure have made up for that over the season. Molokai, Kauai, and rural areas of Oahu have all been displayed in a beautiful radiant fashion. Having been there twice myself, I believe that every American should see this true paradise.I had never seen Alex O\\'Loughlin in anything before this series, and he knocks the ball out of the park with his modern, over the top, somewhat Neanderthal McGarrett, who pushes the law to the limit to win. His chemistry with Scott Caan makes the series. They deliver without turning this into Baywatch.It would be interesting to see Jean Smart, the governor, a bit more, but that might politicize the cases a little too much. The writers and producers have a long way to run with this thing.\"Get them off my island.\"',\n",
       " 'Honestly this was a movie I was never really planning to see. I thought it was another cash grab at our nostalgia. But when the initial trailer came out with the original sonic, I partook in the hilarious and frightening memes and joined in on the criticism. When I found out that they were redesigning Sonic due to the backlash - I was shocked. I never thought a studio would listen to our voice, and oh was our voice heard.So after I saw the second trailer I thought to myself, well, I guess I gotta go see it now. \"Put your money where your mouth is.\" If the studio took the time to do this for us then I will gladly pay my money to see this.And I\\'m glad I did. It\\'s a fun movie. It\\'s not perfect by any means, but it\\'s an enjoyable film for the family. I love the new Sonic, I love the cast, Jim Carrey is spectacular as always. It was a fun movie from start to finish. And it was really entertaining. I love the voice character for Sonic too, I think he fit perfectly. I would\\'ve given it a 7/10 but like I mentioned before, an extra star for caring about the fans and the audience.',\n",
       " \"I live in Asia so we got to see the movie 1 day earlier than the U.S. And no Corona-chan is not a problem in my exact location.I can tell you with all certainty that Sonic the Hedgehog Movie does not suck. It's actually a decent family movie. A little basic for adults, the pacing and a certain plot in the middle is rather poorly executed but on the whole, the main plot is fine, the acting is fine, the jokes are okay-ish, the music is fine, the production is really good, the animation is really good and the movie is fun.It's not going to win any awards but it's good enough for casual movie-goers and more than good for Sonic fans. I gave it an extra Star from a 7 because the creators actually listened to fans and gave a good-looking Sonic which in all honesty, is what made the film because Sonic looked good. Real good. Sonic's animation is quite a joy to watch and doesn't take you out of the immersion.\",\n",
       " \"I think they did a good job with this. The design of Sonic so so much better than the one featured in the trailer. It baffles me how they thought the original design was ok. It looked like a child's drawing of something they had seen in a nightmare.The relationship between Sonic and James Marsden is super cute too and you'd do become invested in it.It is very much a kids movie but it's nice for older people to see as it's filled with nostalgia from the Sonic games. There are plenty of little Easter eggs that people who have played the game will notice.This movie is also really charming. It has lines that are funny too.So I would watch it especially if you have any interest in Sonic I don't think you will be disappointed or frustrated at what they have done with the property.\",\n",
       " 'Sonic The Hedgehog is an action comedy movie based on the SEGA video game series of the same name. Starring James Marsden and Jim Carrey, it is a fast-moving adventure (obviously) that should entertain newcomers and keep fans of the original series satisfied.In the small town of Green Hills, Montana, a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) lives in hiding after being forced out of his original dimension due to his powers of super speed. After accidentally causing a blackout throughout the whole area, Sonic attracts the attention of Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey), an eccentric evil genius whom the government has hired to track Sonic down for experimental purposes. Now on the run once again, Sonic enlists the help of local police officer Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) to aid him in avoiding capture and hopefully make a new friend in the process.Even if you aren\\'t a hardcore fan of the series, Sonic The Hedgehog provides a nice amount of fun action and quirky humour to draw in even the most casual of moviegoer. I myself was a Nintendo kid growing up, preferring to play as the Italian plumber instead of the blue hedgehog, but SEGA and their mascot character always had my respect for being worthy rivals during the video game wars of the 90s, and the same can be said for this. In fact, this film seems to strongly acknowledge Sonic\\'s 1990s roots, from his love of chili dogs to listening to music on a boombox. Of course, there are some references to modern trends but they are kept to a minimum likely so that the film will age better.Jeff Fowler, who makes his directorial debut for a feature film, does a fine job juggling his storytelling duties with showing off some solid special effects along the way, especially on Sonic himself. It is well known by now that Sonic\\'s original design for this film was poorly received by the public so it was decided that his overall look would be changed. This worked well in the film\\'s favour as not only does he better resemble his video game self, but he even feels more naturally integrated into the real world. We watch as Sonic dashes around causing mischief and escaping danger through different environments like the big city or the quiet countryside, deriving enjoyment along the way. This led to some amusing Quicksilver/Deadpool-esque moments which provided great comic relief during several action scenes.Comedian Ben Schwartz was a great pick to provide the voice and motion-capture of Sonic himself, both emanating the character\\'s trademark cocky attitude while also showcasing his loneliness and longing for true friendship. This, in turn, makes him more relatable to the audience and causes him to have more human traits than some of the actual people in the film. James Marsden also gave a likeable performance as Tom Wachowski, not merely being relegated to the straight man role but also having his fair share of funny moments as well. However, it is Jim Carrey who steals the show as Dr. Robotnik. I\\'m not sure whether it was seeing how perfectly tailored the character was to his comedic talents or if it was just how nostalgic it felt to see him acting like his over-the-top 90s self again, but virtually everything he said and did had me laughing out loud. I hope we will see more of Carrey\\'s portrayal of the character in the near future, which reportedly he has expressed interest in doing.In the end, even though the film isn\\'t groundbreaking by any means, it still provides much needed entertainment thanks to its respectful take on the source material that, like POKÉMON Detective Pikachu before it, definitely feels more like how video games should be handled for the big screen treatment. There is certainly potential for other game franchises to be adapted into movies with a similar style and it is starting to feel as though the \"video game curse\" may be fading away altogether. There are two bonus mid-credit scenes worth staying back for, and while they aren\\'t of Masahiro Sakurai approaching Sonic about the Smash initiative, they should excite fans of the series just as much.I rate it 7/10',\n",
       " 'Here is a full analysis of the show season by season.Season 1:\\nExtremely underwhelming start for a show I\\'ve heard so much about. The animation is pretty good for a TV show, but that\\'s about it. The episodes are very straightforward, have no real consequences, and more often than not seem to be like moral anecdotes for kids. Very disappointing.\\nRating: 5.0/10Season 2:\\nDefinitely some improvement but still a long way from anything \"good\". It is still standalone episodes, very repetitive, and apart from a little better world exploration, the show seems to be headed nowhere.\\nRating: 6.5/10Season 3:\\nAll of a sudden, the show entirely changes its tone. This is no longer a kids show, more like PG-13. The animation also improves greatly. From episode 1, we are given a much more compelling narrative. It\\'s no longer standalone episodes, we now have story arcs. Longer arcs means more time to develop the story, added depth to characters, and much more in-depth world building. This show finally seems to be going somewhere.\\nRating: 8.0/10Season 4:\\nThis is where the show becomes just amazing. We feel The Revenge of The Sith gradually being set up. The stories are getting darker and grittier. What\\'s best is the narrative is no longer black and white. We are shown the war from the perspectives of those we have so far only called \"villains\".\\nRating: 9.0/10Season 5:\\nAnother amazing season. Like I said, after season 4 the show reaches a very high standard and stays there. Although there are some boring arcs, the main story fully compensates for it. I will not go into too much detail, in fear of spoilers.\\nRating: 9.5/10Season 6:\\nSlightly, only slightly, worse than season 5, which for me is the absolute peak of this show. It still has its fair share of good story arcs and sets up many events of Episode 3.\\nRating: 9.0/10Season 7:\\nSeason 7 has 3 story arcs, of which the first is pretty decent, and the second is catastrophic. However, the final arc of 4 episodes is something in itself. It is deserving of all the great reviews that it is receiving and more. By playing into episodes 3, it in a sense redeems the prequels, but I will not say much about it to avoid spoilers. Besides, Disney\\'s graphics overhaul is simply amazing, and makes the show so much more fun to watch. A perfect season and show ending for me.\\nRating: 10.0/10Thoughts:\\nAn amazing show which I would recommend everyone to watch. However, if you have less time/patience, I\\'d suggest skipping the first 2 seasons, and soke arcs of the coming seasons (just check the episode ratings to know). This show is a great filler that takes place between the events of episode 2 and episode 3 of the prequel films. It adds so much more relevance to the events of episode 3. Viewers\\' biggest problem with episode 3 was how it felt rushed. Just watch Clone Wars and it will all seem to fit in place.Salient Features:\\n1. Humanising the Clones:\\nThe films did little justice to the clones, who were treated quite like droids with the exception of Obi Wan and Anakin. This show shows their human side, their psychology during the war, and adds uniqueness to each clone.2. Ahsoka:\\nI will not say much to keep this review free of spoilers. All I can say is, Ahsoka\\'s character development is at par with some of the best I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s a real pleasure seeing her grow from a unbalanced padawan to a well trained Jedi Commander.3. Dark side:\\nThis show also portrays the war from the perspective of the siths, somewhat humanising them, and giving us more clarity as to their decisions.4. Bounty Hunting:\\nEven the bounty hunters aren\\'t two dimensional characters who only care for their bounty. The show portrays bounty hunting as a respectable job, and displays the code of honour which exists between them.TL;DR:\\nThe show is a solid 10/10 for me, and a worthy addition to the Star Wars Saga. A must watch for all Star Wars fans.',\n",
       " \"Taking place between Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith; The Clone Wars highlights the war between the Republic and Separatists. Considering this event was basically glossed over in the movies, it's great to be able to see the war for ourselves through this series.The Clone Wars is one of best animated shows I have seen. It balances the goofy moments you can find in Star Wars, and animation in general, with serious moments. Also, it gets progressively darker as the show continues. Most of all, it actually makes The Clone Wars interesting. This series could've easily fell into a trap similar to one that the new trilogy is in, but it's completely fresh, and a great expansion to the Star Wars lore. It gives more development to characters from the prequel trilogy; such as Anakin, Obi-Wan, Padmé, etc. And introduces new characters, that you'll grow to love just as much, mainly Ahsoka and Rex. The Clone Wars also gives the villains some more time to shine; with General Grievous, Count Dooku, Palpatine, and another returning Sith being prominently featured.Overall, the show is a great addition to the Star Wars universe. The various scenarios and battles that our favorite characters are thrown into are interesting, but above all, actually entertaining and fun. I am completely hyped for the return of this show, and hopefully Disney does the rest of the series justice. Give this a chance if you're a Star Wars fan. The amount of material here is sufficient for even the biggest fan of the franchise.My Rating: 9.0/10\",\n",
       " 'I am writing this review now after the show has ended with the seventh season. And all i can say is wow...\\nI am so glad that I started watching this show, not only because it is fantastic on its own, but it also improves the prequels greatly.\\nI mean I have never hated the prequels and I actually like them, because I grew up with them and I still remember beeing 8 years old and seeing Revenge of the Sith in theaters which was just mind blowing for me back then.But back to Clone Wars.\\nI must admit that the first two seasons are not that good as the rest of the show. They are more kid friendly, the animations werent that good during this time and some of the plot lines werent that fascinating. But still, the first two seasons had their moment. Season 3 slowly started getting better and as soon as season 4 started, I could not stop watching the episodes. I got so hooked on it just binged through it.But what makes Clone Wars so good?\\nIt simply expands the Canon, it gives us more information about the world of Star Wars, the Force, and a lot of characters who didnt get the opportunity to shine in the prequels get now the treatment they deserve\\nCharacters like Captain Rex, Kit Fisto, Padme, Plo Koon, Mace Windu, Ki-Adi Mundi, Jar Jar, Grievious, Count Doku and a lot of others now get a real personality or are getting improved.\\nAnd of course Anakin, the Chosen One. He is the one who profits the most of Clone Wars. I get why a lot of people dont like him after the Prequels, but now... He is an amazing character in the show and you cant stop but love him. He gets so fleshed out that seeing him turn to the Dark Side is even more painfull now.\\nAnd the Clones in general. In the movies they are more like mindless soldiers but now they all get a personality and they are beeing developed into fascinating characters and we get now quite a lot different clones which are all different and you simply fall in love with them.\\nWe also get a new look on older characters like young Boba Fett, Obi-Wan or yoda which is nice.\\nAnd what was really important to me, we get a closer look on how Palpatine was able to manipulate the whole Galaxy and rise to power.We have amazing plot lines that spand over multiple episodes. Some of them focus on politics and palpatines rise to power, other focus on the clones and are like a Vietnam war movie. There is something for everyone.On top on all of that we also get a lot new characters which are brilliant. First of all of course new adorable clones and most importantly. Ahsoka Tano, a character which I love. I dont want to take to much away, but there are really so many new characters which improved the universe and were responsible for many great plotlines. And also one of my favourite characters rises up from the dead and I jumped up with tears of joy when I saw him...And he ist not even wasted, but due to him we get some of the best Star Wars Storys ever, especially in the new season 7.And if we are allready starting to talk about season 7. The first few episodes were ok. nothing special... But the last four episodes of Clone Wars are killing it and are some of the best Star Wars moments ever.\\nAnd watching Episode III now feels like a totaly new experience which hits way harder then before.I could endlessly go on and on about why I love Clone Wars, but I think I made my point clear.\\nSo I would definitly recommend this to every Star Wars fan who wants to now more about the world and the characters. You wont regret it',\n",
       " \"I have been watching this series since it came out, and thank god i taped them as i have watched each episode up to 4 times each now.Absolutely awesome series! I was sceptical at first, and it started off a little ropey but now i'm hooked. I'm up to episode 6 so far, and every episode has literally gotten better and better and better.Evry episode that has come out since the movie i have said this is the best episode so far, and thats a good thing! I believe there are meant to be a hundred or more episodes of this show? I hope thats so, and i wish i had them all right now! I would not be seen for weeks.Anakin is great in this, better than the live action films IMO. And Asoka is pretty cool too, although she got off to a bumpy start.In fact i only have a few subtle gripes, Droid voices, though i'm getting used to them. A bit short each episode, but at least it leaves me wanting more. Which is good. Lack of John Williams music throughout, and the last episode had drum n bass in it, which was bizarre and unwelcome! But still, these are only minor gripes, and I know the creators are working on making it better for series 2 according to the force-casts, so hopefully if these little gripes get fixed, the show should be perfect.Oh and as for the 2 reviews on here that are super negative, and say its not for the true fan, well, I AM THE TRUE FAN! And i like it! Sounds like a couple of nay-sayers to me, jumping on the Lucas hate bandwagon. Wouldn't surprise me if they hadn't even watched an episode of this show at all. Guess thats the internet for ya.Anyway, keep em coming! Keep em great! Adjust as necessary and Star Wars will be great once more for the next generation. And the old one.\",\n",

The animation was an improvement to the movie, and the character developments were amazing! However, they have to have young kids watch this cause it\\'s Cartoon Network for Gods Sake! That is why the droids are so stupid throughout the series. I don\\'t mind that now. As a matter of fact, they do get me to laugh sometime.Asokah Tano was very annoying in the movie, but in the series second episode, I realized that she is only a kid and she can do great things during the 100 episodes.And lets face it, the clone characters are just bad ass!

       " \"''Life, uh... finds a way.''One of the best & most iconic movie quotes of all times.I don't know what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said. Really...Considering this movie was made in 1993, visual effects are of incredible quality, as you see it better on blu-ray. When it comes to story, it's completely original, nearly flawless. I can't say too much about the acting. I believe acting is not the movie's strongest point. But still, it was enough for that movie. You don't need to be like Marlon Brando in a sci-fi movie about dinosaurs and has great visual & sound effects. The movie is very fun to watch.I also sensed a small message like, ''don't mess with nature''.Best thing about the movie (for me) was the score. Especially the ''Welcome to Jurassic Park'' scene. Of course we're talking about John Williams, the guy who wrote the theme for Star Wars, so that's not a surprise.Highly recommend it.9/10\",\n",
       " 'Look up the word \"awe\" in the dictionary... ya know what you\\'ll find? Jurassic Park. And now in 3D! Usually, I don\\'t really like post- converted 3D in movies, but this one won me over. Ever since I was a little kid, I\\'ve always loved Jurassic Park (I think we all did) and I\\'d always heard that it was one of the best movie theater experiences ever. Unfortunately, I wasn\\'t born when this originally came out so I never got the chance to experience that... until now! And damn, were they right when they said it was an awesome movie theater experience because it sure as hell is. It\\'s so fun, engrossing, and thrilling to watch it on the big screen, with all the sound surrounding you (the sound in Jurassic Park has got to be some of the best sound in a movie ever). Jurassic Park is also one of the most monumental movies of all time. It defined CGI. The CGI and special effects in this movie still holdup today and are even better than most movies today.The story of Jurassic Park is that a really rich guy has cloned dinosaurs to make an amusement park full of living dinosaurs (you would do that if you could too). Because they are these live dinosaurs in the park, his investors say that he needs approval from experts, so he recruits Dr. Alan Grant (a paleontologist who is more or less the protagonist of the movie), Dr. Elli Sattler (a paleobotanist), and Dr. Ian Malcom (a mathematician who\\'s character is pretty much the show stealer). Through a number of circumstances, the dinosaurs get loose and all hell breaks loose. Now, we have our movie being one of the most awe- inspiring movies ever; as well as being one of the most suspenseful movies ever. When the characters first enter Jurassic Park, you see the many dinosaurs in the distance and the theme (one of the greatest movie themes of all time) is playing in the background. Your jaw just drops. And the dinosaurs look awesome. Sometimes they\\'re CGI, sometimes they\\'re animatronic. Sometimes they\\'re amazing... oh wait, that\\'s all the time. One of my favourite scenes is when the T-Rex is attacking the car and a flashlight shines in its eye and the eye dilates. That just shows how detailed and alive these dinos are.But the dinosaurs don\\'t wreak havoc until about halfway, or even 3/4, through the film. Even yet, the movie does a brilliant job of immersing you into it, bringing you onto this island, and getting you to care for the characters. The dialogue and acting are so good that you feel as though you\\'re there with the characters (it drags sometimes but it\\'s easy to get past that). And when they\\'re in peril, you feel as though you\\'re in danger too. I just can\\'t stress how substantial the suspense in Jurassic Park is. The 3D does add to that, too. The 3D in this movie is probably the best post-converted 3D I\\'ve ever seen and it works really well.Jurassic Park is really a movie that everyone should experience (notice how I didn\\'t say \"watch\"). If you get the chance, see it in theaters and have your mind absolutely blown. The movie is full of awe and imagination; it sometimes makes me feel like a little kid again.

It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing. I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more.\",\n",
       " \"This movie was released during my childhood while I was already a dinosaur enthusiast. I saw it 2 times at the cinema and as far as I can remember these were the only 2 times I ever saw an audience applaud at the end. It made an big impression. Computer generated images were new at that time and we didn't know what to expect. But I think I can speak for everyone if I say we were blown away. The dinosaurs looked so real. And even in the years after that computer generated images in other movies were just not as good and realistic as in Jurassic Park.Another thing that made this movie is the soundtrack. John Williams (the composer) absolutely nailed it! The music at the arrival to the island combined with the the adventure ahead was just breathtaking.So you have a good story, good actors (I loved Jeff Goldblum for his humor), state of the art special effects and an thrilling adventure. This makes it still my number one of all time and I don't expect that to change anytime soon (or ever).\",\n",
       " 'I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting \"the best Marvel movie ever,\" or at least \"the best Marvel movie if the year.\"I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn\\'t the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn\\'t because there were jokes and they didn\\'t land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn\\'t laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making \"Roots\" meets the new \"A Birth of a Nation\"And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn\\'t let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I\\'m surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the \"Bond, James Bond\" way but in the \"If I tell you who I am it\\'s going to give me extra power\" kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren\\'t very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the \"we\\'ve seen this before only done better\" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can\\'t do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn\\'t wow with action...then you\\'ve failed.In fact, you\\'ve failed so much that you aren\\'t \"the first Black super-hero movie\" I\\'m taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining.',\n",

Taken straight from a \"Learn English conversation in 5 minutes\" Chapter IOkay special effects, nothing special,lets say 20 percent of normal Marvel extravaganzas.The story line is weak and goes round and round and round...No menacing bad guy. The potentially menacing one had a lesser role to play.Very stupid and misplaced one liners, completely out of the blues some of them.

       " 'How do we perpetuate the honor, the memory, and the lesson of the nameless and faceless thousands that fought and died for their country during World War II? To document WWII as mere history is to marginalize it as merely another fact on an eventual high school exam. To merely acknowledge that it was war merely because war is a terrible thing is to ignore its consequence, and its undeniable relevance to the lives of everyone that followed them.To confer the proper deference to the death and honor of those uncounted soldiers, we must integrate into our souls the reality of living as their beneficiaries at the expense of their lives. While there is no absolute way to understand the cost of World War II, we can experience the barest shadow of its reality by seeing it through the eyes of those who fought it, who lived through it, who saw death on an unimaginable scale during it, and preserved a free world as a result. That shadow is a magnificent humility captured in a simply brilliant HBO miniseries, \"Band of Brothers.\" \"Brothers\" sheds the narcissism of the television camera to bring you face-to-face with the dramatized-yet-real faces of the men of Easy Company, one of hundreds of American and allied forces to invade Europe in an effort to stem Nazi Germany\\'s military machine. \"Brothers\" compels the viewer to see World War II on a personal level unmatched by virtually any other war production. You see not glorified geniuses of war, but hardened, otherwise average men, fearless and fearful, heroic and imperfect, lucky and unlucky, thrown into an incomprehensible maelstrom of war and savagery. They emerge not merely as a force that won a war, but one that established the foundation on which a generation\\'s freedom was built, and through which the unspeakable savagery exacted on a race was exposed.\"Band of Brothers\" isn\\'t for the fainthearted. It offers an unapologetically graphic and frank depiction of war and the men who fight it, bringing home in a vivid and undeniable way. From the simplicity of the training centers to the brutality of near-abandonment in the forests of Bastogne under German siege, \"Brothers\" offers a lesson that should be mandatory for the eyes, hearts, and minds of those too young to know of World War II as anything other than an historical event, such that some measure of the price of freedom and the cost of tyranny can be interwoven into the souls of those who watch it. To say \"Band of Brothers\" is merely extraordinary is to diminish its sheer greatness not merely as a work of television, but as a demonstration of freedom\\'s 20th-century turning point.To appreciate your freedom, and understand in an inherently deficient way its benefactors, \"Band of Brothers\" is simply not to be missed.-David',\n",
       " \"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn\\'t follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can\\'t help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it\\'s either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan\\'s perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can\\'t explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It\\'s like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film\\'s humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That\\'s right, years.Once the film ends, you\\'ll want to watch it again, for there\\'s something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film\\'s ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can\\'t seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie\\'s quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer\\'s complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that\\'s really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film\\'s point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)',\n",

       " 'All Hollywood can do anymore is give us CGI-fest films with no depth in character or story, or remakes that are almost all worse than their originals. Typically, the films tend to mirror the demands of their audience; people who can barely sit through anything that actually requires some attention.Korea gives us a great space story that is a bit of a mixture of Wall-E, Firefly, and Blade Runner. The film also gives us a great balance of story, character, and action. Why does the story work so well? Because like all great storytellers, they focus on the story and the characters.George Lucas once stated, \"a film with special effects and no story is a pretty boring thing.\" Funny how he would actually end up going against his own proverb, and it is also true of what has happened with much of western filmmaking, as stated above.The film also has a lot of heart, which will make the viewer all the more appreciative that it isn\\'t just an action movie. This is enhanced by veteran actors like Joong-Ki Song (Descendants of the Sun) and Tae-Ri Kim (Mr. Sunshine) as well as Jin Seon-Kyu.The movie isn\\'t perfect, but if you want a good story, some laughs, and some great action sequences, you won\\'t be disappointed.',\n",

It's like some people ran out of dopamine in their brains to feel happy.This movie has it all, comedy, grief, joy, mystery, excitement, suspense, it's like an all-in-one package which triggers every emotion you have.

One moment a main actor is about to sacrifice itself and then he walks back on the bridge. Enemies and good guys seem to appear out of nowhere to give this movie an overdose of plot turns or set up scenes.You also will get sidetracked a lot into unessisary scenes that are only distracting. A lot of my criticism would be fixable by just releasing a better cut, removing distracting scenes that don't progress the storyline and removing scenes that don't tie up loose ends, and then its needs to set up the remaining scenes properly with some more dialogue, this last item would be a hard fix. This movie is probably a 4.5 and i am giving it a 5 just for the attempt and for the love of sci fi. If they would fix it i guess it has an 6 or 6.5 potential.\",\n",
       " \"Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.\",\n",

He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I\\'d say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we\\'re all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It\\'s very non-linear. The events of the film don\\'t play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it\\'s also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene.

The fights are really great here. I couldn\\'t help but be reminded of Tarantino\\'s, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don\\'t often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I\\'m certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn\\'t very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He\\'s a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!\"Deadpool\" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it\\'s nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn\\'t already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It\\'s self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!',\n",
       " 'What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.',\n",
       " 'At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story.

Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it\\'s just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn\\'t help but be reminded of Tarantino\\'s, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don\\'t often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I\\'m certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn\\'t very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He\\'s a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!\"Deadpool\" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it\\'s nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn\\'t already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It\\'s self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!',\n",
       " \"I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.\",\n",
       " 'In a world.. where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty, #Deadpool comes along and shows you how it\\'s done! It\\'s the perfect combo of action, comedy, and R-rating that really don\\'t give two sh*ts about your sensitivity. Do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl you\\'ve been crushing on during chemistry class in high school? Well, you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for DEADPOOL.Ryan Reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, Morena Baccarin plays his hot-ass girlfriend, Vanessa. This woman is the embodiment of sexy. They are a match made in Marvel Comics\\' heaven. But their dream is crushed upon discovering that Wilson has cancer all over, a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers. The lab is run by Francis/Ajax (Ed Skrein) who himself is a bit of a mutant. The brutal experiments turn Wade Wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one. He\\'s now bent on revenge, especially after Ajax kidnaps Vanessa. Meanwhile Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead from the X-Men, try their best to convince Deadpool to join their team and become one of the good guys. But let\\'s face it, that ain\\'t DEADPOOL\\'s style! The first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writers/creators Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other. The next people in line to thank are screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who remind us why we loved \"Zombieland\" back in 2009, they inject the same brand of humor into DEADPOOL and keep the character faithful to the comic books, yes, by that I mean none of that crap version of Wade Wilson in \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" anymore! Applause goes to Tim Miller as well, what a helluva feature directorial debut, clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out, if you just let him run with it, it\\'s like giving G.I. Joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart, great things can happen.For those of you who are not familiar with DEADPOOL, just a heads up, this movie, just like the comics, is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex, violence and humor, and that\\'s exactly how we like it. Wade Wilson is a chatterbox, he talks a lot, to some this can get annoying, while to the rest, it\\'s music to our ears, mainly because of the sh*t he says. And he breaks fourth wall, meaning he\\'ll talk to you the audience. But what\\'s even more epic than that is the fact that he is AWARE of the universe that he\\'s in and the universe that you\\'re in, and those two collide in the most epic way possible, so Ryan Reynolds\\' character, Wade Wilson, makes fun of Ryan Reynolds the actor and also mocks Ryan Reynolds\\' previous poor decisions like Green Lantern and People Magazine\\'s Sexiest Man Alive This movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans, it even has what I think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema. For a while, I heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants, but I\\'m glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment a.k.a origin story, so it\\'s simple enough for the new fans to follow. I love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic, it\\'s like insult comedy or one of them roast shows, everybody is fair game. The fights are rock \\'em sock \\'em and the VFX is impressive! And I can\\'t be happier for Ryan Reynolds, I\\'m sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since \"Green Lantern\" and whatever the hell that was in \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine,\" so with this DEADPOOL movie, he finally got it right, you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre, and so now he\\'s really part of the gang. He was born for this role. He was destined to play this. In many ways, Deadpool is kinda like Van Wilder on crack. And actress Morena Baccarin as Vanessa\\x85 well, let\\'s just say that after watching this movie, every guy on earth will wonder, \\'Why can\\'t my girlfriend be more like that!\\' If you\\'re looking for a date movie, DEADPOOL is it. if you\\'re looking for an action-packed movie, DEADPOOL is definitely most certainly it.',\n",
       " \"First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean\",\n",
       " 'Good lord, I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. Where as I usually prefer the more mature and serious MCU movies, this is a wonderful exception. It\\'s funny, it\\'s lighthearted and it\\'s imaginative. That does not mean it\\'s lacking good characters. Each of the Guardians have their own struggles and quirks, while also being very likeable and funny. The best scenes in the movie are the ones where the characters just talk, which shows just how good the chemistry between them are. The plot is fairly simple, yet engaging, and the pacing is really good. The action is well made, the emotional moments are good, the climax feels pretty climactic. I do have a few issues though. Firstly, while the villain seems to have a reason for his actions, he\\'s still very one-dimentional and boring thematically. I also got a little tired of the \"end of the world\" trope which seems to be in most superhero films these days, even though this movie handled it better than most other movies I\\'ve seen it in. The comedy was also a little too silly for my liking, but it wasn\\'t a big deal. These flaws don\\'r ruin the movie in the slighest though, as this is a fun, exciting and engaging experience that I highly recommend.',\n",
       " \"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this.\",\n",
       " 'I remember sitting in Hall H at Comic-Con two years ago, when Marvel first announced Guardians of the Galaxy. This came on the heels of the title reveals for Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World, and my initial reaction was one of utter confusion. What the hell was Guardians of the Galaxy? I was completely unfamiliar with the source material, and upon learning that the team featured a gun-wielding raccoon and a fighting tree creature whose could only speak a single phrase, I was even more puzzled.Fast forward to Comic-Con 2013, when James Gunn appeared onstage in Hall H to showcase the first trailer for the film. It was so unlike anything Marvel had ever done before, so far outside the box that I immediately fell in love with it and couldn\\'t wait to see more. Although that first trailer was well-received by the Comic-Con audience, the general public seemed to be scratching their heads in much the same way that I had when the film was first announced. Marvel fans would love this, no doubt, but could this bizarre little sci-fi romp with a cast of unknown characters actually work?The answer is a resounding \"yes,\" as Guardians of the Galaxy is not only an exceptionally well-made comic-book film, but an exceptionally well- made film, period. It\\'s a sprawling space opera with a host of memorable characters, a joyous sci-fi romp through beautifully realized worlds, wildly inventive action sequences, and an almost nonstop barrage of humor and fun. The protagonists are a bizarre assembly of losers and misfits, with the CG-created Rocket and Groot providing some of the most emotional and human moments of the film, and it\\'s all brilliant. Marvel should be applauded for allowing Gunn the opportunity to realize his vision, because rest assured, this film wouldn\\'t have been nearly as good with someone else at the helm.Guardians of the Galaxy has a distinct personality that sets it apart from other Marvel offerings, yet there are enough recognizable elements to remind audiences that it exists in the same world. Clocking in at just under two hours, the film maintains an impressively well-balanced pace, avoiding the problem of over-inflation that many superhero films fall victim to. I can\\'t think of a single moment when I wasn\\'t completely enthralled with everything that happens on screen, and as soon as the credits began to roll I was ready to watch it all over again.',\n",
       " \"I entitle my review A New Hope as I walk out of the cinema feeling like I have just watched the Star Wars of our generation!As a huge Marvel fan (both comics and film) I was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of Guardians and what a perfect cast to play them. The biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been no easy job. DC are still trying hard to get Justice League going, Marvel just made a film with a talking tree and Raccoon and it was AWESOME!!!Not a bad performance all round and comic fans will be happy with certain nods and winks scattered throughout. Probably my top Marvel film yet, it has the fresh new feeling the first Iron Man had with all the action and humour of The Avengers. 10 stars from me, even if your not a comic book or sci-fi fan, this movie has something for everyone.\",\n",
       " 'Generally speaking, I\\'m fan of Chris Pratt and here he is thoroughly entertaining as the \"Star Lord - Peter Quill\", a sort of inter-galactic treasure hunter who is challenged to track down an orb. Once he finds and tries to sell it, his world becomes a whole lot more interesting as just about everyone from Djimon Hounsou - sporting a cracking hairdo as \"Korath\", to kick-ass Zoe Saldana \"Gamora\" and the most unlikely of duos \"Rocket\" & \"Groot\"- one a racoon (Bradley Cooper), the other a walking tree with an extremely limited vocabulary (Vin Diesel) - want to snatch it from him! It soon transpires that the orb contains a source of unimaginable power that the evil \"Thanos\" and his lieutenant \"Ronan\" (Lee Pace) will stop at nothing to possess. When all these attempts to steal his artefact attract the attention of the authorities lead by an immaculately coiffured Glenn Close, they end up in a maximum security prison where they decide to join forces - alongside the deservedly named \"Drax the Destroyer\" (Dave Bautista), forcing their way out and setting off on a quest to stop the arch criminals from reducing Ms. Close\\'s world to atoms. It\\'s got bundles of charisma, this film - the script is witty and fast moving, the characters are easily the most interesting and developed in the ensemble Marvel-verse, and the pretty eclectic soundtrack is used properly, rather than as a substitute for the dialogue. I\\'m praying that it doesn\\'t spawn a whole slew of pointless sequels and spin-offs; it\\'s originality is an huge part of it\\'s charm.',\n",
       " \"Guardians of the Galaxy, directed by James Gunn, is one of the best comic book movies ever made, while also being yet another model film of the MCU. James Gunn didn't follow the MCU criteria/style, putting his own directorial hand all over the film for the better. Gunn incorporated a lot of stylistic, unorthodox shots, that just popped off the screen with the great color pallet and cinematography.Guardians of the Galaxy is a true breath of fresh air, packed in with tons of heart and soul! Because of the creativity of James Gunn, he made Guardians of the Galaxy a fantastic stand-alone film, that anyone can watch and enjoy, while still having tons of play from the past MCU films. James Gunn absolutely NAILS the tones of this film! He crafted a mainly comedy based tone, that was well balanced, taking some of the edge off of the darker phase two, while also incorporating a fantastic emotional and grounded tone. These concepts and tones could've easily been taken in the wrong direction, because of how cheesy everything looks on paper, but due to Gunn's brisk pace, and constant excitement, The Guardians of the Galaxy absolutely works! I don't know if I can technically call this a negative of the film, but I just needed more of everyone; not to say everyone was underdeveloped, there was just so much more potential with these amazing characters, I just wanted more! One of the only negatives I have to say about the story, is the fact that the premise itself isn't the most original, while setting up for expositions; other than that, James Gunn did a fantastic job having the characters move the story.The characters were the absolute selling point of the film. Marvel has this thing where they take these lowkey characters, and turn them into everyone's favorite superheroes. This perfectly imperfect cast just meshed so well together, creating amazing chemistry, and genuine tention and banter. James Gunn and the creative team did a great job with establishing each original character, giving everyone some depth, while allowing them to have a few great character moments. The creative team did the best they could fleshing everyone out, because if they tried to flesh everyone out equally, this film could've easily hit the four hour+ mark. Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Starlord, is easily the most focused character out of the bunch, but I was perfectly okay with that, because he brings so much heart, charisma, wit, charm, and humor to the character, while having a fantastic delivery to all of his lines. Even though Chris Pratt can be a little over the top, he is such an easy character to get invested in, because of his damaged back story. Chris Pratt gives a great performance, proving he can be that guy in the leading role, and why he belongs in the MCU. Zoe Saldana as Gamora also puts on a great performance! Her back story is probably the most fleshed out, and impactful to the big picture, leaving her character to be the most grounded out of them all. She brings a lot of wit to the film, while also having great layers to her character. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon is my favorite character out of this favorable bunch. For a side character, he out shines the leads on a few occasions, bringing the best sense of humor out of the whole MCU, while adding in his outside of the box wit. He compliments the group extremely well, carrying a lot of weight throughout the film. The biggest surprise of the film, was Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer! He, by far, has the best delivery of the film, bringing a tremendous amount of heart and humor to his character. Even though Drax isn't the most fleshed out character, not having a whole lot to do, you can't help but care for this guy, due to his extreme likability. With Vin Diesel as Groot, not having much to do or say at all, he just has that likability to carry him through this film with no issues. Michael Rooker as Yondu is one of the few characters that's from the comics, and he serves his purpose well. He puts on a super fun performance, carrying decent weight throughout the film. Lee Pace as Ronan tries his best, but the way his character was written, left him to be one dimensional, underdeveloped, and forgettable. I wish his character was more fleshed out because, even though he didn't have the most original motive, he had the potential to be a halfway decent villain.The screenplay by James Gunn and Nicole Perlman, was just a blast of fun! This is, without a doubt, the MCU's funniest film, with the perfect balance of cohesive jokes, that hit every single time! If they would've gave a little more to a few characters, there isn't much else that can hold this film back.The action of the film was present for a great deal of the time. Every single sequence had it's own appeal, being well crafted and shot, with almost seamless effects.The best part of this film, without any question, is the soundtrack and score. James Gunn and Tyler Bates did not need to give us this amazing 80s soundtrack, backed up with this original score, but they did... and they did that for us. Without the score and music, this is a completely different film, that just wouldn't be able to top off each scene.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy deserves to be in everyone's top 5 of the MCU! With all of the greatness this movie has, it outweighs the negatives tremendously!\",\n",
       " 'First Hit: This movie was absolutely horrible and a waste of time and money.The original title of this film is \"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn.\" The title alone is a warning enough, and when you read it, it is all you\\'ll need to know about this story. I do not know what the screenwriter or director was thinking, but it wasn\\'t about making a movie that had conscious cognizant coherence.From the get-go, this film is a mess. Using narrative and disjointed clips of film, to attempt to put the story in place and time was useless here because there really is no place or time.I thought \"Suicide Squad\" was a quirky fun movie and where we meet Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) for the first time. She was odd, \"out there,\" and on the edge of crazy. This film Birds of Prey is supposed to give us the backstory of Ms. Quinn. It is also a way to introduce other characters, the \"Birds of Prey,\" consisting of Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), \"The Huntress,\" aka Helena Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and \"Black Canary,\" aka Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell).There\\'s little character development, so they use some narration and snippets of past stories to fill in the backstory of these characters.This group of women come together because of and over the improbability of a young pickpocketing girl, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), swallowing a large, I mean colossally large diamond stolen from a thieving, conniving, and self-named lord of Gotham, Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor).Lots of fighting ensues, and we always know who wins. The fighting scenes are not well-choreographed and felt staged. The logic stream of the story was virtually non-existent while it seemed as though the director Cathy Yan threw together a bunch of clips of film scraps she shot with this cast doing stuff and called it a day.Robbie is an excellent actress. She\\' has proven her abilities in many films. Therefore, I\\'m surprised she co-produced and acted in this hot mess. Despite her talents, this was not good work. Perez, who has been missed in recent years, did what she could with this limiting role. Winstead was the best of the lot. Her quiet demeanor and her story of how she came up with \"The Huntress\" was amusing when everyone else liked calling her \"Crossbow.\" Smollett-Bell tried to make her character mean something but, again, the script and direction let her down. McGregor was okay as the foil for the Birds of Prey. Christina Hodson created a disjointed and lackluster screenplay with little substance. Yan has no business directing a film with this film as proof.Overall: This movie was a total waste of time.',\n",
       " \"To simply put it without wasting anybody's time unlike my time was wasted watching this garbage, Birds of Prey And ....etc is a chance completely wasted! should've been, Harley Quinn (add any lame title here), There's No Notable presence of Birds of Prey here. The film is How Harley Quinn stood against a gay version of Black Mask.The plot story and the directing is a true to heart chick flick and clearly influenced by the feminist movement. The script emphasizing blindly on discriminating against men by representing all male characters in either gay, bisexual portrait or an evil and traitorous manner! The female on the other hand are represented is sadly based on race not on the relation to the comics character nor the fans desire, which is clearly a method of trying to tastelessly involve everyone that no race feels left out! I.e., the choosing of an Asian Cassandra Cain over Barbra Gordon.The disaster starts from the casting process, I'll never stop believing that Margot Robbie is a very bad depiction of Harley Quinn, From the looks which is feels way off, as Margot has a long face while Harley has a round face to the fact that she does not feel or sound the same, least to say how different Arleen Sorkin says Mr. J or Puddin' with a nerdy yet playful way and how Margot fails to represent that. Not to mention the ridiculous child size mallet they gave her in this movie. I believe the main reason why many fans drool over Margot in the first place is mainly because they didn't see anyone else play the role on a big screen yet not because Margot is a good actress or can represent Harley well. The scenes decorations feels like it was designed by a crazed extravagant fashion designer and the fighting scenes along with the directing is obviously all over the place in a disastrous manner.My suggestion is don't waste your time or money on this garbage until the suits learn how to make a proper Harley movie.\",\n",
       " 'Before we saw this movie, my son told me that there were lots of 1/10 reviews on IMDb from people who hadn\\'t even seen the film. Well, here\\'s a 1/10 review from someone who has.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn reminds me a lot of Lori Petty in Tank Girl (1995), another comic book film that really ground my gears. Like Petty\\'s character, every quirky mannerism and snarky comment by Harley got right on my tits, as did her horrible fashion sense. In addition to Robbie\\'s diabolical performance, we get equally obnoxious turns from Rosie Perez as a tough cop, Ella Jay Basco as an annoying pick-pocket, and Ewan McGregor as camp crime boss Roman Sionis, plus an absolutely pointless tribute to Marilyn Monroe, lots of dumb, supposedly amusing captions, a tiresome self-aware voice-over, and a horrible CGI hyena.Director Cathy Yan (who?), working from a charmless script by Christina Hodson, is unable to do anything interesting with the admittedly wafer-thin plot, which can be boiled down to just a handful of words: \"everyone is looking for a diamond\".A muddled, noisy, gaudy mess, full of poorly constructed action scenes and goofy humour that falls flat on its face, Birds of Prey is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema in recent months. And I saw Cats and Bombshell (another Margot Robbie disaster).',\n",
       " \"Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.\",\n",
       " 'Pili (Kea Peahu) has her sights set on attending a Geocaching camp, but after her grandfather (Branscombe Richmond) has a heart attack, Pili must forfeit her prize and go to Hawaii with her mother Leilani (Kelly Hu) and brother Ioane (Alex Aiono). Once there Pili finds a journal among her grandfather\\'s possessions that tells of a group of privateers who hid a cache of gold on the island and sets off to find the treasure unaware of the dangers surrounding it.Directed by TV sitcom staple Jude Weng and written by comic book/screenwriter Christina Strain whose work can be seen in cult favorite TV show The Magicians and Netflix\\'s upcoming series Shadow and Bone, Finding \\'Ohana marks another original by Netflix. Finding \\'Ohana feels like a mixture of Lilo & Stitch by way of National Treasure, and while there are good elements on display, the movie is a little clumsy out of the gate.Kea Peahu makes her debut here as our protagonist Pili and brings a natural energy to her performance that is engaging. She does a good job conveying the drive, stubbornness, and arrogance of her character and has some nice moments of vulnerability and pathos throughout the film. YouTube personality/singer Alex Aiono makes his film debut here and for the most part does reasonably well, but sometimes the clunky material especially early on doesn\\'t allow him to make the best impressions, but despite this he does feel engaging and falls comfortably into his role as the older brother dealing with an overly energized mischief prone sister. The supporting cast is also quite good. Kelly Hu despite a somewhat limited role plays her role as a struggling single parent trying to juggle multiple crises at once quite well and Branscombe Richmond plays the curmudgeonly grandfather character quite well and has some very sweet moments with Kea Peahu as Pili where they convey a genuine sense of family. But easily the best performance is Owen Vaccaro as Casper a nerdy overly cautious neighbor who Pili (kind of) befirends who gets some very funny scenes and lines in the movie. Vaccaro was previously seen in The House with a Clock in its Walls playing a lead and its nice to see him here again giving another good performance.The movie itself is very hit and miss, the opening is very clumsily handled with characters often telling us about situations rather than showing us them, and while the characters feel like there\\'s a richness to be explored for engagement and pathos, it often feels like those take a backseat to shenanigans and very on the nose humor. There\\'s also not much in the way of drive at the beginning of the treasure hunt as the movie just kind of ambles along from one marker to the next. The flashback sequences are also rather underwhelming as they\\'re subject to a running gag where the characters in the flashbacks will speak anachronistic dialogue as dubbed by Pili\\'s Kea Peahu that is somewhat chuckle worthy upon first impression but becomes kind of grating upon repeated use. By the half way point I was ready to label this a very \"meh\" movie, but then it kept going.After a flabby first half that\\'s haphazardly delivered the movie course corrects and makes its stakes more dire and adds some tension and drive that\\'s been missing from the movie up to that point. Without giving too much away there\\'s some scenes of visual wonder and danger that all tie into the themes of family and Hawaiian mythology quite well and actually make the movie feel more engaging as it goes on.Finding \\'Ohana is clearly meant for a family audience, and as a family film its perfectly decent. The acting is spot on from everyone involved and the exploration of Hawaiian mythology is quite fascinating (though admittedly I\\'m unaware of how accurate it is) and the sense of adventure is quite fun once it gets going. Unfortunately clunky writing and an overly slow pace in the first half create some hurdles the movie needs to work around, but once it finds its footing it becomes an engaging adventure.',\n",

I found the premiere episode refreshingly intelligent, subtlety comedic, and engaging.Timothy Olyphant truly fits the role and expertly portrays Raylen Givins, a US Marshal with a flare for the attitude and historical respect expected (and required) of the position reminiscent of a Texas Ranger.His Marshal authenticity and brand of justice leads him back to his hometown where he endears old friends and confronts new enemies while sidestepping questions of his dubious past and kin.The story is fun and believable except for some legal proceedings regarding a recently widowed woman, but otherwise delivers very well and provides for good previews.Lastly, I discovered that this show is based off a novel by Elmore Leonard. Leonard is the talent behind such movies as \"Get Shorty\" and \"Be Cool,\" among others, that I revere as favorites. I was pleased to see that a show with his name in the credits is also praiseworthy.',\n",
       " \"Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.\\nThe Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph.\",\n",
       " \"I've only seen the original Blade Runner once and it was a long time ago. I liked it but I just haven't got around to revisiting it. I mention this because even though I'm not a die-hard fan of Blade Runner, I still found the plot of 2049 engrossing. It's a well put together mystery, I found that they constantly took the plot in unexpected directions and other than the trailer spoiling the return of Deckard, I was always excited about what was going to happen next. The movie pulls an excellent bait and switch at the end that really surprised me. They made the right decision to not repeat the formula of the first one and take the story to a new place. They also create some compelling subplots which is something that few movies get right.The biggest star of this movie is the cinematography and the excellent work of Roger Deakins. The original was noteworthy with the special environment that Ridley Scott and his creative team brought to the screen. That was continued here if not improved upon. The look of L.A. in 2049 they decided to go with isn't completely distinct but it was a little more understated (I'd compare it to the 2017 Ghost in the Shell but less fantastical). My favourite scene might have been a shootout in a defunct club where the lighting and the background show are turning on and off. I don't hesitate to praise when a movie looks good but this is an exemplary example of using visuals and atmosphere to help build on a strong story.Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her previously.There were points in this movie I could have rated this a 9/10 but some small things that I had to dock the movie for. Even with a compelling story, the movie has such a long run time that it couldn't help but drag. There are certain scenes where the movie wants you to really drink in the environment but they could have edited it a little tighter. They also couldn't help but lose me at points through how much artistic flair the utilize. Villenueve is an authority in this area and while I appreciate an artistic approach to this science fiction tale, for me they overdid it a little.I was surprised how much I ended up liking Blade Runner 2049. I think if you're a big fan of the original, you'll love this to bits. This is successful in bringing in the uninitiated but I think fans will enjoy this even more. I haven't been on board for all of Villenueve's films but this is a good combination of his artistic style with enough of a commercial element for the masses. I'd give this somewhere between an 8-9 but with the extremely long run time, I'll give this an 8/10.\",\n",
       " 'I know better now.These guys have destroyed Blade Runner just to release yet another sequel that should not have been made. Ridley has recently been actively destroying the Alien legacy and releasing subpar non-stories. Villenueve is going from this to yet another unneeded remake, namely Dune.In short, these guys are now in the same league as JJ Abrams, Paul Feig and Michael Bay. That is sad. Blade Runner deserved a better (and lasting) legacy.BR2049 is so long, so boring and so pointless that one really wonders. It boggles the mind that they released an expensive movie that has no point to make and no care to destroy the classicness of Blade Runner.There was a cool headquarters, cool hologram technology and advertising and sexy women. Those deserve points, but what is with the very corny and jaded dialogue? the script was bad and the lines were worse. Compare to the original Blade Runner!People, think twice before attending silly Marvel films, boring Star Wars films and the next 5 Ghostbusters. They are boring and insult your intelligence and their legacy. I am done with these thieving sequels.',\n",
       " 'Blade Runner 2049 is not a good film, but it is not a complete disaster. A story that did not need telling and logically failed, an overlong and slow moving narrative and a massacre that makes no sense any longer were countered by original visuals and beautiful women. I will go with a rating of 4/10.The problems with this film is that it has sequeltitis. They came up with it because they needed to make money from a sequel and have no original ideas.\\nThe massacred are peaceful and are farming. Why do it then? The story moves so slowly that the 3 hours seem like 6. The acting is not good, but moderna ctors cannot touch older ones so that is par for the course. When in the original the performance by the chief of police, his goon, the industrialist and the eye maker would rivet and excite or the strong personality of the replicants would make the blood boil here it is a paint by the number series of appearances.With that said the futuristic society is fun to watch. Even more fun is Ana de Armas, the sexy and delicious hooker and even the legs of the Chief (who is old so has short hair unfortunately). These babes add to the vista and architecture that is most pleasing to the eye in this sequel.',\n",
       " 'Retreads seem to be the \"thing to do\" as of late. Studio\\'s who seem to be out of ideas, visiting the past for inspiration. Sad fact is, most of the retreads are \"second rate\" and MacGyver is no exception. The word that another reviewer used to describe this retread is the same one I would choose, \"tiresome\". The original MacGyver worked because it had a fresh and different message. That science \"not\" violence can be used to peacefully resolve threatening situations. The original Macyver was very much an anti war figure. By contrast, the retread MacGyver, is a poster boy for \"mainstream\" values, including, the US military. He\\'s also smug, over confident, a womanizer and frankly, a throughly unlikable jerk. Its tiresome stuff, that in many ways is the complete anti-thesis of the original series. There\\'s no sense of hope and inspiration, as found in Richard Dean Anderson\\'s character. All in all, a BORE FEST. If you have not seen MacGyver before, my advice, take a look at the original series, it wont disappoint. Two out of ten from me.',\n",
       " \"Sorry, but I can't get how ANYONE can say they like this show. I'm not expecting Richard Dean Anderson or anything, but the only thing the show is about is the 'cliche's of MacGyver, not the actual story, Opening Gambit or challenge of the week. Yes, the original MacGyver has voice overs, short voice overs explaining either why he was doing something or where he was to set the stage. It seems over half of the episode is voice over though.Also the updating it of him being a 'ladies' man so destroys the whole personality of him. He was a ladies man in the original and has girls falling over him not because he was smoking hot and buff (as he is in this) but rather because he was a genuinely good guy. He was an intelligent, modest individual that felt anything could be overcome if one just put some thought into it, and dealt with people with genuine fore thought instead of acting like a bull in a chine closet (see the original's 'Trumbo's World' episode for a perfect example). This MacGyver is a loud mouthed 'bro' vs a soft spoken man with charisma who approaches things with an open mind.But basically they took all the ancillary parts of the original series and made the new series all about those while throwing out everything that made the original so charming. Instead of it being about story development and slowly learning more and more about the main character it is in your face constant bludgeoning over the head of how smart he is and how he is the most awesome dude ever. Neither of which are MacGyver traits.All in all don't waste your time. The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, and the show runners have no idea what made MacGyver episodes so great.

How can I honestly say it\\'s good or bad if I don\\'t even watch it? This show should never have attempted to replicate one of the greatest TV series ever. I am a huge Magnum fan since it was originally aired, and used to pay respects at \"Robin\\'s Nest\" (\"Pahonu\") every time I was on O\\'ahu until it was torn down earlier this year (a large emotional hit already for all Magnum fans!). Now this show comes out...Obviously it has to be \"updated\" with even bigger fake action scenes (courtesy CGI) which distracts as the original never needed such \"tricks\" to make it interesting. The cast isn\\'t bad but they don\\'t come anywhere near the chemistry the original Magnum crew had. And changing Higgins into a woman, that just shows how desperate it is to cater to its audience. Why? John Hillerman was the quintessential actor for the role, and played it beautifully. Changing the character\\'s gender is only pathetic attempt to draw interest to her. Swing and a miss!Unfortunately, Jay Hernandez, Zachary Knighton and Stephen Hill are equally unsuccessful in their roles. Hernandez simply doesn\\'t have the charm and charisma of Tom Selleck (who does?). Knighton isn\\'t bad as Rick but it\\'s not a very deep role in the first place. Hill simply doesn\\'t bring to the screen what Roger E. Mosley did. Lastly, the desperate crossover appearances from the current \\'Hawaii Five-0\\' (another poorly made remake) simply fails. The original \\'Magnum P.I.\\' didn\\'t need Steve McGarrett to bolster its ratings.Overall, the show may have had some chance of success if it simply was another O\\'ahu-based cop/detective show; but as far as I am concerned this is yet one more in a long list of remakes that shouldn\\'t have been made (i.e. the rebooted Ghostbusters, Oceans 8, what else am I forgetting?!?). Has Hollywood really run out of premises on which to base new TV series? Has there been one reboot that actually was worth watching? The new Magnum simply proves that writers cannot depend on nostalgia to bring viewers to the screen. Go back to the drawing board, guys, and come up with something original!

Making a new \"version\" of Magnum P.I. (in which Higgins is now a woman no less - no political correctness there!), as if anything can improve on the true originality of the 1980s series.Sometimes I marvel at how the original came up with the whole concept and structure -- film noir style narration, set in Hawaii, ex-Navy Intelligence, down on his luck aspiring P.I. (no, I prefer Private Investigator), living on the estate of a perpetually absent novelist, under the supervision of an English major-domo with two dobermans, with two fellow Vietnam vets, one with a chopper to enable our hero to move among the islands (something Hawaii 5-0 was lacking) and the other with mafia ties that help our hero in his investigations, and driving a Ferrari, that was not his to begin with, to give him a flare and machisimo that nothing holds a candle to today. Truly original! and still a classic.Now there is this -- for the simple reason that such originality and creativity is TOTALLY lacking in Hollywood today.I am not even going to bother with this series! Instead I am breaking out my DVDs of the original series and will enjoy every minute of them, while this series dies and early, and deservedly undignified death, and their creators vanish into obscurity, hopefully never to enter the realm of television entertainment without taking a few classes on creativity, imagination and originality.',\n",
       " \"When will Hollywood learn that we don't want their PC crap, gender swapping, diversity and globalism shoved down our throats? You think they would have learned when the 2011 PC reboot of Charlie's Angels lasted 4 episodes before it was canceled. You know, that was the show with the 3 ethically diverse angels and a cute young Hispanic Bosley who was a computer genius? And instead of being simple PIs, they were complete bad asses capable of taking down international terrorists. That is exactly the same road this Magnum PI reboot is going down, only worse. The action is just as unrealistic, the characters just as unrelatable., character development just as weak and the plot just as nonsensical. But, the lead is even more miscast here than the Angels in that reboot. For the love of God, why can't we just have traditional American hunks like Tom Selleck or the late Robert Urich in lead roles anymore? The public is tired of this casting against type, anti-hero nonsense. And don't get me started about the recasting pivotal role of Higgins as a woman who can take down the same bad guys that later easily kick Magnum's ass, all after getting shot in the arm!And what happened to good old fashioned story telling, tongue in cheek humor and fun banter between characters? Why does everything have to be an all too serious but simultaneously mindless shoot em' up with all too frequent and unbelievable action?

       " 'Snowpiercer was a surprise to me. I thought it would be just another \"social commentary\" dystopian film trying to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games craze. Instead what I ended up getting was one of the best post-apocalyptic films I\\'ve ever seen. A smooth roller coaster of action and quiet, dark dialogue.And don\\'t get me wrong, it is another \"social commentary\" dystopian film, and yes, perhaps it\\'s riding The Hunger Games craze just a little bit. But, when that riding ends up producing a film of this quality, is it a bad thing? And it\\'s not like The Hunger Games invented the idea of alternative future where the poor are trying to usurp the rich people that are controlling them from their towers of ivory.

Everything from the design of the train to the A-list cast of actors to the storyline that keeps up the relentless pace, but still has time to reflect on the motives, histories and moods of the characters.Snowpiercer is simplistic art. It doesn\\'t try to win you over with limitless of details, high explosives or flashiness. Rather it takes a central idea and fills it with as much quality as possible.

       " \"¨Know your place. Accept your place. Be a shoe.¨I was pleasantly surprised at how well Korean director, Joon-ho Bong, made the transition to this his first English language film because the style and tone of the film still felt entirely Korean despite starring some well known Hollywood actors. I enjoyed this film so much that I ended up watching it twice and that is something I rarely do. Based on the French graphic novel, Le Transperceneige written by Jean-Marc Rochette, Snowpiercer is an ambitious dystopian sci-fi film that despite having a very absurd premise works really well thanks to Bong's direction. It has some great performances with memorable characters, several exciting action scenes mixed with bizarre comedic moments, and a thought provoking metaphor on classicism. It is a bleak film but Bong handled the material so well that it kept me engaged and interested. Unfortunately the film does suffer from a rather unconvincing final act, but for most of its running time I was so entertained that I wasn't too disappointed.Snowpiercer takes place in 2031 after a failed global-warming experiment has frozen all of Earth and wiped out all life. The only survivors are the passengers of a super train traveling across the globe with a perpetual-motion engine. Designed by Wilford, an engineer who knew the experiment would fail, the train has been running for 17 straight years and a social class system has developed as the passengers of the rear end live in extremely poor conditions. Here we are introduced to a young man named Curtis (Chris Evans) who is trying to come up with a plan to get past all the security guards in order to reach the front section where Wilford is presumed to be. He isn't alone on this quest as most of the passengers are upset for the abuse they've suffered and the extreme poor conditions in which they are forced to live in. A wise old man named Gilliam (John Hurt) who helped Wilford design the engine, has been helping Curtis rally the men together. Curtis's good friend, Edgar (Jamie Bell), is also awaiting the moment to begin their revolution as things begin to get worse once the guards take a few kids away from them. Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Andrew (Ewen Bremner) are among the victims whose children have been taken away from them so they are also eager to attack. The first step of the plan involves freeing Namgoong (Song Kang-ho), a prisoner who has a special gift for unlocking the doors to each section, but the task won't be easy as the guards will do what it takes to make sure they stay at the rear section of the train.Bong has directed several successful Korean films like The Host and Memories of a Murder, and in his first English language film his style remains untouched. Despite having some scenes that borderline in the ridiculous he somehow manages to balance those moments really well. For example there is this huge action scene that he has set up between the rebels and the guards who are awaiting them with axes. The bloody and violent confrontation begins, only to be interrupted as the train is approaching a bridge which serves as a landmark for the New Year. The fighting stops for a few seconds as everyone begins the countdown and admires the view of the outside world from inside the train, then the violence and mayhem continue. There are several moments like this where Bong perfectly balances these gorgeously crafted choreographed scenes with moments of quirky comedy and twisted sense of humor. The best example of this type of humor comes from the two characters played by Tilda Swinton (who is unrecognizable in this film) and Alison Pill who are terrific and steal the few scenes they are in. I really loved that classroom scene that felt completely out of place with the dark tail section of the train. I think it was those goofy moments that I enjoyed the most in this film. It was a great sensory experience to get to follow these characters through each section of the train and I have to give Bong credit for his visionary style because as our heroes progress to the front of the train things begin to get more and more bizarre and you never know what to expect. The film is short of being a masterpiece because the final 30 minutes are disappointing, but as a social satire Snowpiercer worked better than other recent sci-fi films like Elysium. It is a very weird and strange film, but it is really good and I enjoyed it even more on my second viewing.\",\n",
       " 'Let\\'s get this out of the way. Yes, this is my first review. I\\'ve watched about half of IMDb\\'s top 250, and did like most of them. Somebody brought this movie to my attention, and as a 7/10 I didn\\'t have high expectations. Honestly, though, knowing this is at least an attempt at some sort of allegory, most of the plot holes are kind of petty and minor. Comparing Snowpiercer to \"The Room\" (don\\'t watch that) because you couldn\\'t tell how someone would have an Irish accent, or realized that the premise of this movie is brutal and inconvenient - is kind of realizing the problem with 99% of all movies altogether.For anyone brutally bothered about plot holes, tell me, is The Hunger Games more logical? Ant-man? Even Inception, the Dark Knight, or Lord Of The Rings? You can\\'t blame a movie for plot holes, rate it a 1, and then ignore those same plot holes in every other movie in existence. By that token, any and all of the Star Wars movies should be rated a 2.No. People here are nitpicking, and that\\'s a nice way to put it. You don\\'t know how the cockroaches kept spawning? Jesus, maybe they breed fast. I have no idea. But then you should point out that Yoda\\'s aches and pains should have technically kept him out of commission years ago, Jack Sparrow should be dead, Captain America has no sources for his morals, Harry Potter makes no sense, and any and all plot holes about Mordor that you can find online.But do they? Nope. Most of the negative reviews here are a one-show, leading me to think there\\'s someone with multiple accounts and a large amount of time to hate this movie.I\\'ve seen quite a few sci-fi films - I\\'m no newbie to the genre. But their are always plot holes in those films, at least technical ones. Faulting Snowpiercer (an allegory, of all things) for having plot holes that are granted in other movies is just not right.',\n",
       " 'After graping the global movie universe\\'s attention with \"The host\" (2006), Korean director Bong Joon-ho serves up his first offer in the English language with \"Snowpiercer\", a futuristic, sci-fi fable as well as a hybrid of art house and mainstream thriller.The micro depiction of the macro human race is through the titular vehicle (literally meant) – a train that circles the post-apocalyptic world, a frozen hell resulted from the backfire of an over-executed maneuver in battling global warming. Secluded from the outer world, the survivors are stratified by social class, the highest at the front (a perpetual-motion engine) and the lowest at the back. The linear (in more ways than one) story is quite simple, the underprivileged bunch at the back fighting its way, car after car, all the way to the front to gain control of their own destiny. Through the allegory progression, the audience witnesses a rich pageantry of environments – rough workplace, lush greenhouse, giant aquarium, plush lounge, and more.The impressive cast is well assembled. Chris Evans sheds his \"All American\" heartthrob image to play this perhaps his first heavy-weight role as an earthy leader of the revolution. John Hurt is the semi-disabled wise old man, a rich reservoir of knowledge. Other key members of the group include Jamie Bell as the young follower, Octavia Spencer as a mother searching for a missing child \"drafted\" by the ruling class for some obscure purpose, and Song Kang-ho as a Korean security expert. The show-stealing personas, however, are on the opposite side. Most delicious is Tilda Swinton, barely recognizable with ingenious makeup (essentially of a dental nature) playing the spokesperson for the dictator. Allison Pill (so impressive as Zelda Fitzgerald in \"Midnight in Paris\") is another manifestation of eccentricity, a pregnant kindergarten teacher, all sweetness until she produces a gun and starts shooting. The dictator is competently played by Ed Harris.The movie is quite long (a little over 2 hours) and does not hurry itself as most blockbuster thrillers would do.

And I applaud him to be so successful in that: in many moments during the film, I felt I was experiencing a fevered dream of a fried fish. -- That\\'s how insane this film is. It takes great genius to present something as insane as the plot of Snowpiercer.This film will be remembered, analyzed and revered for a long, long time.

And we see the evolution of civilisation from simple beginnings to science, education, quality, luxury, then hedonism, wastefulness and eventual demise, in exactly that order.All of that can be overlooked, however, if you\\'re just the average movie-goer who simply wants a good story with a hero, an adventure and an end goal. In which case I say the film is a good one but nothing special in that respect. Certainly there were parts where I thought, \"eh?\", until it clicked later that it was all part of the Director\\'s greater cinematic design.But for the arty film student types, this film is sure to be the topic of many, many essays for years to come.Clearly every part of the film was deliberate - every shot, every line of script, every item in the background. It was true art. None of that quick-buck profit-incentive Hollywood stuff.In conclusion I recommend this film to everyone, particularly people who want to learn something or gain some insight from what they watch. For the everyday movie-lover, go into this with an open mind and have a really long think about how you can compare it to the world today.Top stuff, 10/10',\n",

The movie looked great, the first half was beyond thrilling, the acting for the latter half was just, top notch, the action was bloody and fantastic, and most of all, the ideology behind the story was interesting to say at least. I can't really say anything more than that since saying anything beside the trailer would be a dead giveaway, but really, wow. I honestly don't know how the director's unique style and choices would get to the American audience, but as a person who enjoys this strange and beautiful execution of director Bong, this movie fulfilled everything i want from Bong's film an intellectual Sifi movie. It gave me a handful amount of things to think and talk about, and those kinds of movies always give me the best movie experiences. Definitely one of the must watches of this year.\",\n",
       " \"No spoilers here !Remember Metropolis, the great silent film by Fritz Lang, and probably the most revered science-fiction film of all times ? Well, if Snowpiercer is not such an absolute masterpiece, I do believe it's the best reiteration of the same concept that made Lang's film so unique : asking questions about the condition of mankind in a futuristic society, and how it does and does not evolve as compared with current times. It's good that not all near-blockbuster scale sci-fi movies do not come out of Hollywood anymore. Snowpiercer is based on a long-forgotten 70's French graphic novel. The Korean director got his hands on a bootleg translation in a Seoul bookshop while filming The Host and got totally hooked. The end product is a French-Korean production, in the making of which one of the authors of the original graphic novel got directly involved. The plot is simple : ecologist freaks have pushed governments to unleash a gas in the atmosphere to control global warming, this proved so effective that the world is now a standalone, snow-covered giant ice cap. The only survivors are all aboard a revolutionary train that goes on and on making loops around the world. It's like Noah's Ark, but including the politics that come with it : first class, second class, workers, fraudsters, the ticket is your fate - for generations. And the consequences are extreme, to such and extent that you can't conceive. Prepare to be shocked at times. Imagine the vertical multistoreyed humanity of Lang's Metropolis, the horizontal way. Some of the tail section fraudsters decide to rebel against their condition and progress to the head car of the train regardless of the risks. Every car they go through bears its grotesque and mind-bending surprises. And tells us more about how this society actually works and what it relies on. This film has style. Even though it reminds of Gilliam (see 12 monkeys) and Matsumoto (Galaxy Express), there is real personality and originality. CGI is limited to a few breathtaking scenes that really add up to the storyline. Acting is mostly excellent, especially by Ed Harris and John Hurt. But most importantly, this film triggers reflection, soul-searching and debate like true Sci-Fi gems should. Unlike most Hollywood movies, it is not Manichaean : the story and morals are complex and debatable. You heart keeps swinging for scene to scene as you learn more. The ending asks a lot of questions. All in all, when the end credits start rolling, it's a film you want to rewatch, not because you haven't understood, but because you want to understand more, and experience more.\",\n",

In the first 13 minutes of season 2 you learn that Venezuela is not a socialist dictatorship with a leader like Maduro, no it\\'s got a nationalist government with a Trump type leader. The opposition isn\\'t a guy like like Guido who wants to take his country back from from the dictator for his people. The opposition leader is a female \"who just doesn\\'t want to be a idiot\" according to Jack Ryan.This was a huge mistake on amazon\\'s part to rewrite history this way. What does it mean when people hate the president so much they attempt to fool the public like this. Maybe it isn\\'t just about Trump, maybe there are people who really want the public to view Venezuela through this lens but you must ask yourself why? Many people are not informed these days and get their history from popular culture like a tv show. My best guess is the Democrat Socialists of America had some influence in this story line and the execs were so uninformed they didn\\'t notice or care that history was being rewritten.Real Tom Clancy fans and Clancy himself would see this smearing of history for what it is so in the big scheme it\\'s just one more reason tv has become unwatchable.',\n",

It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.SUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don\\'t even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the \"safe room scene\". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.',\n",

Deadpool 2 delivers and is easily comparable in quality to the first movie and I sure as hell did not expect that.With fantastic new additions, all the returning cast and excellent cameos this is the Deadpool sequel I desired but didn't expect (Or possibly deserve).With it's brand of over the top violence, quick fire humour, endless pop culture references and Reynolds in the role he was born to play Deadpool 2 is a worthy sequel in a franchise that I don't ever want to end if it continues like this.So damn funny, I can't wait to see what they do with the third movie.

       " 'Ever since DP became a sensation and a worldwide phenomenon, die-hard fans have been asking for a worthey second entry.For a long time, superhero movies - not to be confused with films based on graphic novels, which is an interesting item of truth - have become a pinata for serious film critics and reasons are not lacking because we are talking about a cataract of conservative products, mediocre and totally interchangeable with each other. Typical examples of what happens when marketing and advertising discourse replace creativity and some kind of narrative, rhetorical and / or even formal talent (the stories of these \"cosos\" are otherwise schematic , do not say anything at all and are even hyper redundant in terms of digital gadgets, today present in all sad pompous proposal of the mainstream). But perhaps the worst of all is that they bore with their childish and semi-televised dialectic - from the TV of yesteryear - oriented to reproduce ad infinitum the same antics.With this panorama it is not surprising that even the exponents who try to break a couple of rules of the format end up falling into the usual quagmire of non-development of characters, the most ancient political correctness, the humor for young children, that pathetic self-referentiality and constant a concatenation of prefixed niches of the market - it is not even possible to call them subframes - that can only appeal to a series of individuals co-opted by the most aseptic industry, the one that for a couple of decades has decided to ignore any nonconformist substrate at the level of the ideological basis of their \"toys\".Deadpool 2 is another link in this endless chain of perky fun-time itself (hobby products that do not even pass the time), which once again highlights the crisis of a cultural conglomerate that fetishes the most burned clichés.Pretending to be \"set sail\" for the puerile level of superhero movies, this sequel to the work of 2016 essentially repeats the formula of its predecessor: many jokes with harmless puteadas, some very innocuous sexual allusion, scenes of action that are ironic, Tired questioning to camera and a cheap background melodrama that sabotages itself because the movie-read the Marvel factory-does not understand that because of so much \"attitude surpassed of everything\", both beretta cancherism and so many plastic simulated CGIs, nobody can identify with these shiny but well-emptied jars from a rusty and insipid assembly line.In other words, DP2 is the perfect sequel to DP, specifically. Doubles down on everything that fans love about the original, nonstop graphic violence, gore, torture, sex, nudity, swearing, drinking, drug use, and more, so expect the same here, while it fixes some of the first film\\'s issues. Also this one features the best post credits scene EVER. Yes! Deadpool 2 as the title says, gives the audience two end-credit scenes. Ladies and gentlemen, the wait for the scenes are worth it! Hilarious is the perfect word to describe how the audience feels of watching \\'em. They don\\'t relate much with the whole story but the crack jokes are powerful enough to make people care of the clips.The sequel is superior to its ancestor. It conveys silly comic drama that stimulates both your cerebrum and body.',\n",
       " 'Both deadpool\\'s are brilliant. I perhaps enjoyed the first one a little bit more, but this is still a brilliant movie. My thoughts are:(1) Great plot, script & visuals. The storyline is solid and there is a clear goal. The movie is also well structured, as is the pacing (good combination of talking and action scenes). The comedy is on point & I would assume that most people would find it funny.(2) Great casting. Ryan nails the role (to the extent that I don\\'t feel like he is acting, it feels natural). I\\'m not sure if the movie was specifically written for him, which I wouldn\\'t be surprised about. Also, the supporting characters complement him well. The kid (Julian aka Firefist), isn\\'t the type of person that I would typically put in that role, but it worked well.(3) If I was forced to find a critique, I would say that the ending was a bit abrupt, almost like \"and now we\\'re all friends\", the end. But at the same time, at least they didn\\'t unnecessarily drag it out.Would recommend!',\n",
       " \"Like another reviewer has stated, when I first saw the trailer for Teen Wolf, I was totally uninterested. The only reason I watched the first episode was because it came on directly after the MTV movie awards and there was nothing else on TV. I was actually surprised by how good it was. The acting was good, the special effects weren't too cheesy, and there is something dark and edgy about it. I admit some parts of the plot are predictable, but then again, there are some things that flat out surprised me. The actor who plays Stiles is fantastic, and I think he is a big part of why I like the show. Also, Derek Hale's character isn't too bad on the eyes, either. After all this talk about how this is a Twilight rip-off online, I have to say that I think it's unfair to compare this to Twilight. Let's be real, Twilight has horrible acting, and the acting in Teen Wolf is actually decent. And the plot is completely different in my opinion. In Twilight, the story surrounds Edward and Bella's relationship; In Teen Wolf, I think the story is more about Scott's transformation into being a werewolf and the challenges it brings him. Yes, Allison (his love interest) is a part of those challenges, but the story does NOT revolve around their relationship. This show has a TON of potential, and I could definitely see them going above and beyond what they are doing now. But I am entertained for now and I will continue to watch the season until the end. 8/10\",\n",

I think the producers should seriously think about updating the \"name\" though. Now Watch and Love!! 1. The story line is pretty much satisfying in the first season. And definitely improves in the second. Great potential awaits.2. Amazing actors/actresses are discovered. Especially Dylan O\\'Brien (Stiles). He is awesome. Both Tyler s (Derek and Scott) are good including the rest of the folks.3. The tension and curiosity manipulations and surprise effects works wonderfully.4. Characters do develop through the second season. They become more appealing and sincere.5. Writers do not bore people with unnecessarily kept secrets (like Merlin who hides his ID for 5 seasons from Arthur... *sigh*) 6. Most importantly, this show makes you want to be a part of it. A part of that world, their world. This is important.Are you still here??? Go and start watching.',\n",
       " 'My friend had been pestering me to watch this show for a year but I would always refuse. From the little I knew, I had only heard about there being wolves and an unnecessary amount of shirtlessness. Both of course are true but there is another element to the show that makes it different.Mainly the fact that after season 1, they showed us another side of the supernatural world with all the different creatures like kanimas, kitsunes, notgitsunes (to name a few). Another reason being Stiles. Sure everyone talks about him all the time but him and his friendship with Scott really make the show. In seasons 1 and 2 he\\'s the sarcastic, lovable comedy relief which something like teen wolf needs with it being so dark.The characters all develop well as the plot goes on with some great additions. The running theme is always \"who is the -\" in each season like who is the kanima? Who is the darach?Overall it\\'s a really good show and my only regret is avoiding it for so long.',\n",
       " \"First time I saw the commercial to this show, I was really disappointed. Teen Wolf should remain in the 80's where it belongs. Why? Well... it's 80's cheesy to me, but I still love the film. I really thought this was going to be some cheesy rip off... oh how wrong I was. I LOVE THIS SHOW! It's about time that werewolves get the spotlight. No more Twilight glittery vampires that look constipated or stalk you while you sleep. No cheesy vampire brother love triangle with a girl that looks like a girl from their past that happened to change them into vamps. Don't get me wrong. I love vampires but werewolves are hard to make appealing because they are cursed with a curse that brings natural beast out of them.It's not cheesy, it's well acted, great looking.. mmm werewolves (Derek.. my baby!), and the story is very unique. The more and more it goes on, the more I want. I feel so disappointed when each episode ends and I happen to scream at my TV because the credits roll and I want more.There are a lot of werewolf shows that completely go dead because of lack of interest. Like for example 'Wolf Lake', 'Big wolf on campus' and I'm sure there are more, but I forgot them.I want this show to prosper and show that werewolves can be sexy too.\",\n",
       " 'So I heard about this show called Teen Wolf. My friends, both males and females, told me about it and said i should check it out. My first though was \"Oh geeze, not another cheesy, twilight tween flick..\" So I decided to check it out anyways. After watching it, I was quite surprised and much more impressed than what I expected it to be. This is NOTHING like twilight. Sure, it contains some of the clichés Twilight contains, but other than that there is no correlation and A LOT of television shows have clichés like the ones in this show. It also has an interesting story line that is actually pretty good. Although this show is actually quite good, it has its flaws. The acting at some times is forced, but for the most part it is good. The special effects are also lacking, but many good shows also lack this aspect and are still very successful (such as NCIS). I want to point out that I am in fact MALE and not female so this review is from the point of view of an average guy, not some girl who drools over these types of shows. In fact, this is actually one of the first that I am interested in. If this keeps up the pace and doesn\\'t turn into a cliché-fest, this show could be very successful. Although at the time I\\'m writing this there are only five episodes, it is nonetheless an interesting and thrilling show that everyone should check out.',\n",
       " \"Look, lets be honest and admit that season1 Teen Wolf wasn't great, it showed signs of great humour, horror and was extremely inclusive in terms of some real life teenage themes. Again, it wasn't great but it showed potential.Now after finishing it's third season, it is clear that, Teen Wolf has done something that not many shows have the guts to do, and that is, it has matured with its audience. The creator and producers behind the show have realized that people age alongside the show, that we are not the same people from season1 and thus they have enabled Teen Wolf to reach it's potential and beyond. Now we have fully fleshed out relationships, more adult and sexual themes (which c'mon everyone loves), some more suspenseful scenes with a fair amount of horror and still they have managed to include school into their lives consistently (something that is totally frustrating in so many TV shows). Plus the music on the show is awesome.Don't give up after season 1, persevere because I guarantee that it will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\",\n",

Many people think this is a lame \"Twilight\" Copycat show, It definitely is not. It doesn\\'t even have vampires in it . Plus the storyline is actually based on the person with the supernatural ability, and his day to day struggles, of adjusting with his new ability of being a werewolf. It shows some actual storyline.

       " 'I went into Kimetsu no Yaiba with high expectations. After all of the hype surrounding it within the anime community, I expected it to blow me away. Sadly, it didn\\'t, and ultimately, I walked away from Demon Slayer somewhat disappointed. This anime definitely had its good points; however, sloppy writing and hollow characters ended up bogging this anime down.Let\\'s start with the good.The animation was stunning, and the soundtrack was great.\\nUfotable did an excellent job with the animation as usual. The fights flowed smoothly, with careful detail and excellent utilization of different shot types throughout different scenes. The color palate was diverse and vibrant, which benefited the character designs and certain scenes greatly. I didn\\'t pay much attention to the soundtrack, but when I did notice, it reflected themes appropriately and often would amplify moods within different scenes.Additionally, the story is decent.\\nMinus a few conveniences here and there, the story is well developed with a clear villain and end goal. The power structure is well constructed, and changes in powers are not easily attained.Where did it struggle though?Well firstly, the characters. Yeah they\\'re likable.... that\\'s it. If that\\'s enough for you then this gripe doesn\\'t hold much weight, but if you fancy all-around well written characters, I don\\'t think you\\'ll find them here. What you\\'ll find instead are characters that seem to revolve around a certain trait/group of traits that define their character and leave no room for realistic depth.Tanjiro is a generic and 1-dimensional main character. Okay cool, his family died and his sister became a demon so he\\'s searching to find a cure. Okay cool, he\\'s compassionate and kind towards almost everyone. That\\'s great and all, but those things still don\\'t tell me enough about his personality and character; they never really further his character later either. It seems like the writer just wrote down a handful of good traits and said, \"Hey, that\\'s good enough for a main character.\" They give him no real weaknesses other than his initial physical inferiority, which virtually makes him just as human as his demon sister. The fact that his character and actions throughout the story mostly revolve around other characters and events is a testament to how poorly established he is as a singular character.Zenitsu showed some promise during his initial introduction in the final selection arc and during the \"spider fight\" (I don\\'t know what to call it) but ends up starting and finishing the same: a character for comedic relief, which would be fine if the satire in constantly screaming and complaining was actually funny to me.Inosuke is a loose cannon supporting character who doesn\\'t have much to offer other than occasional comedic relief and utilization as another piece for fights.I really can\\'t rip on Nezuko though; the writing mostly protects her character from criticism, and she\\'s adorable.Speaking of the writing, its not good. It\\'s not awful, but it\\'s not good. Honestly, it feels like this show was written for children. They constantly choose to tell instead of show or tell while showing. Nearly every action or emotion is either expressed through dialogue or inner monologue, which severely dampens the delivery of any emotional blow and makes the strong accompanying imagery practically superfluous.The dialogue also suffers severely from the lack of strong character foundation. It comes out awkward at times and mostly just serves to further the plot or to briefly check on the characters\\' states. The problem with the lack of revealing dialogue is the subsequent weak characters and character relationships. I can\\'t even describe the primary character dynamics other than the words \"friendly\" and \"caring\"; there\\'s nothing remotely notable about them other than maybe Inosuke calling Tanjiro \"Monjiro\" and Zenitsu\\'s dependency on Tanjiro.In the end, Kimestsu no Yaiba succeeds on certain levels but also fails on others. I came in with expectations of a masterpiece but left with a feeling of pseudo-fulfillment. Maybe if I started with lower expectations I would have a more positive reception. Nonetheless, it still emerges at the top of its respective season of anime, and I would probably recommend it to friends if I wanted to introduce them to anime. 6/10 now please proceed to find this to be not helpful because you disagree with my opinion.',\n",
       " 'This is probably the worst movie I have seen in the last two years. And mind that Mulan still is one of my favourite cartoon movie, so thats quite something to achieve.Let me put it simple, every time the script diverged from the cartoon it was for the worst. They left out the best parts and added the most ridiculous nonsense you can imagine.\\nThe Witch: Why add this character? How lazy do you have to be as a screenwriter to only be able to make the story \"work\" by adding a character that can morph into any other character? Betrayal? Complicated motives? Multilayered characters? No - it was just the witch who took over the Kings servant.The Phoenix: Absolutely useless trope. I would argue that the story of Mushu in the cartoon was written better that the whole Mulan 2020 script. This dumb phoenix from the ashes metaphor has been done a thousand times, please for gods sake can these people have one original idea?Loyal, brave, and true. These three words appear like 10 Times through the movie yet absolutely nothing comes from it that wouldn\\'t naturally appear in a Mulan story. Its like making a Harry Potter movie and have the word \"Magic\" appear on every item. Yeah we know, it\\'s a movie about bravery - we have all seen the cartoon.Scenery: The landscapes are beautiful, if this would be a documentary. Did anyone tell the director that the landscapes in a movie need to make sense? I felt like I\\'m watching an old spice comercial: I\\'m on top of a mountain, now I\\'m in the desert, look back to me I am now inside a vulcano.In Summary the movie had three very strong virtues.

       " \"I am frustrated with the reviews here that only talk about the fact that this movie was not a comedy or a musical like Mulan (1998). I love the first Mulan movie and in fact Mulan is one of my favorite Disney characters. I still sing songs from that movie to my children each night. But if I wanted to watch Mulan (1998), I would just watch the original.This movie is not meant to be a re-make, it is meant to be a re-imagining of a deeper story. A legend. A story about a woman who wants to be TRUE to herself but still respectful of her family, her culture, and her country. I think that the comedic relief of the Mushu character would have taken away from the important message that we can all stand to learn from this legend. Mulan learns that what she has within her is NOT something to be hidden away, but a gift that she can share with the world. I also thought the score of this movie was beautiful and the subtle references to the original brought tears to my eyes.If you want to watch Mulan (1998), then watch that movie and don't pay the $29.99 to watch this movie. But if you want to watch a movie with beautiful cinematography, music, and a story that any person across generations can learn something from, then I suggest you try this one.\",\n",
       " \"IN BRIEF: A lavish but conventional retelling of a Disney animated classic.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) The war rages on...no, not the battle over Chinese dynasties. I'm talking about Disney's on-going raid of its animated features into live action films to seize your dollars. Some movies have been big improvements. Others mediocre imitations of the original. Thankfully this update is the former. Gone are the pop songs, the comic wise-cracking dragon, the animated awe, the fun. We are talking serious transformation. Visually sweeping in its epic filmmaking, Mulan (2020) still retains some minor problems in its Disneyfied storytelling. Our plucky heroine may be in search of her own identity. But so is this movie as it presents stock stick figures talking in fortune cookie bromides set against lavish settings. Yes, the script-by-committee strategy loses the battle.This Disney princess is played by Yfei Lui and this beautiful actress is rather bland in the role. She is very likable, but physically she never persuades us that she is a secret soldier, disguised as a man, fighting for the Imperial Army against evil forces. The movie suffers from Yentl Syndrome. (For those unaware of this condition, all you need to do is watch the Barbra Streisand film to see that, in no way, does she resemble a man, so all sense of reality and authenticity is lost.) Such is the case with Ms. Lui's performance. Her feminine voice and stance, her chi, is far from being male. The all-Asian cast tries valiantly to spin this folklore tale convincingly but their characters never seem remotely real-to-life. Only Gong Li as Xianniang, a powerful witch, attains some depth of character. And that is due to the actress, not the script.However, the major strengths of the film are Niki Caro's skilled direction and the panoramic scope lensed by cinematographer Mandy Walker. The director stages her many battle sequences with much flair and, though she tends to overdo the slo-mo in the martial arts close-ups, the effect is breathtaking. Her choreographed action scenes would make David Lean proud. Ms. Walker's lovely use of bright primary colored palette supplies the needed grandeur. Grant Major's production design is strong as are the opulent costumes by Bina Daigeler. (This movie should have been seen on the big screen for its CGI and ambitious staging.)Mulan (2020) is grandiose filmmaking on a big budget. Yet with all its visual scope, it is a prime example of actions speaking louder than words. (GRADE: B)\",\n",

Some very interesting villains come along that actually do stuff for a change, they start killing about 10 red shirt cops every week, and you feel like the characters are actually impacting the story and the city rather than which mafia boss runs the local fish and chip shop from season one.Season 3 and Season 4 reached Pinnacle of Awesomeness.

Ben Meckenzie did a good job in portraying Jim Gordon . I think the acting of Jada Smith was a bit too much.

Everyone is kind of interrelated in this whole mess called Gotham City and we're all waiting with some baited breath not for Batman to arrive, but to see how the bad guys develop around Jim Gordon, who is masterfully played by Ben Mackenzie (who is kind of hot, by the way). One can only guess that, as the series develops, that the mess that is Gotham keeps escalating to a boiling point whereby the caped crusader is truly needed to help Gordon keep Gotham stable.The bad guys are truly vicious. Many of the scenes are cringeworthy and the story flows nicely. I hope they can keep it up for the remainder of the season.\",\n",
       " \"A show set in the Batman universe.. except without Batman? A lot of people didn't like this concept but i was one of the people who did. I wanted to see the villains' rise to power most of all.. but how would they be interesting with no Batman to counter them? Well that's where the early years of Jim Gordon come into play. The show follows Jim as he cracks strange cases whilst trying to help a young Bruce Wayne solve the mystery of his parents' murder. It seemed each week for a while we would see a new villain come in and act like they run Gotham City before Jim and Harvey Bullock shut them down, but it turned into more than that.After a while the show did start to feel repetitive and i wanted to see more focus on a single villain that on a bunch and we ended up getting that by the end and i absolutely loved the finale, but before we talk about that let's talk about what i liked less. Over the course of the series we were introduced and hinted at early incarnations of villains we could expect to see. Scarecrow, Poison Ivy and even The Joker have been hinted at and whilst these are some of the best Batman villains i feel that they should have been left for later series' and that this series should have focused on three particular villains who i will talk about later. The biggest gripe for me was hinting at Jerome being the Joker.. Joker is obviously a big deal in the Batman universe and i feel without Batman being introduced then Joker should be left well alone, but also early hints to Bruce being Batman felt shoehorned in, i feel less focus should be drawn to him and the Batman references as well as the awful cat puns from Selina Kyle should have been toned down a huge deal.However, i do feel Gotham is a very entertaining show to say the least. It is ridiculous and some of the characters act even more cartoony than they do on Batman: The Animated Series which is saying a lot. This isn't so much a bad thing because the show knows how ridiculous it is whilst still maintaining a gritty feel to it and i give it props for that. The acting is over the top but Ben McKenzie as Jim Gordon and Donal Logue as Harvey Bullock are absolutely true to the characters (especially Logue) and play well off each other. The villains i mentioned are Fish Mooney, a new character who isn't in the comics played by Jada Pinkett Smith who brings a stylish yet creepy edge to her character, she was one of the best on the show. I also loved Cory Michael Smith as Edward Nygma, his slow descent into becoming the Riddler was at times shoehorned in but when it worked it was incredible, especially in the finale. The absolute stand out of the show however is of course Robin Lord Taylor who plays Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin. My god, he gave one of the best performances i have seen in TV for years, he made me root for the Penguin's survival and the Penguin has always been low down on my list of favourite Batman villains (that is until now). If anyone can be praised for single handedly making this show work and bringing a whole heap of crazy, ridiculous yet incredible acting skills to the table it is Robin Lord Taylor who honestly deserves a lot more work. He has clearly earned it.So no, Gotham does not go without its flaws and characters such as Edward Nygma should have got more screen time if they were to be introduced now to let their characters develop but i expect series 2 will open a new set of opportunities for them which i look forward to. If Jerome truly is the Joker though i'm not sure how i would feel. The finale, without spoilers, was very satisfying to me. Some of it felt maybe too ridiculous such as the scenes with Dr. Lee and Barbara but overall i was entertained and am intrigued to see more so that is always a good sign. A fun show that doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't quite scale a show like Daredevil but it doesn't exactly try to and it also gives us one of the best characters in recent TV with Penguin.8.5/10\",\n",
       " \"There's nothing wrong a decent thriller where two people face off on the road using their wits and their heavy machinery. So this movie could have been the Duel (1971) of the 2020s (or at the very least a Joy Ride (2001)), but unfortunately, it lacks a director like Steven Spielberg or John Dahl to make it work.After a shocking opening scene, director Derrick Borte starts off nicely with a disturbing montage that shows us the horrible consequences of explosive aggression and road rage. For a long time, his movie seems to be a passionate plea to have more patience and compassion with others in a harsh society where everyone is under constant pressure, because you never know what the other person is going through. Too bad that he gradually undermines this message with cheap shocks and sadistic violence.It's good to see Russell Crowe again after such a long absence, because watching his heavily disturbed maniac snap and terrorize a lady that just happened to piss him off is definitely one of the scarce highlights of the film. No Oscar material, but the man is still an acting heavyweight (no pun intended... well, maybe a little), so much so that leading lady Caren Pistorius cannot hope to carry this movie in his presence. In fact, her character is so passive and uninteresting that I felt very little sympathy for her plight. I don't know if it was the intention here, but I always love movies where you cheer for the bad guy for a very long time, like Face-Off and Law Abiding Citizen; everyone loves tragic villains, and you always hope that the makers can delay that moment where you lose sympathy for them until the very last.Unfortunately, this moment comes way too soon in the movie. In the first half we get some motivation from Crowe's and Pistorius' character for their actions, but that wears off quickly in an endless rampage that seems to be an excuse for a lot of torture porn. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with that, as long as you keep developing your key players. Especially psychopaths work best when they remain completely unexplained mysteries, or when they get fleshed out properly, like the psychologic-meltdown classic Falling Down. However, Crowe and Pistorius never get beyond their minimal and one-dimensional backstories. When the bad guy gets to the point where I no longer rooted for him (again, way too soon), you hope that your allegiance changes back to the heroine. But Pistorius' character keeps making such bad decisions (up to and including a laughably set up climax) that by that time, I no longer cared about either, and could only worry about the collateral damage.Too bad for Crowe and Jimmi Simpson, who probably have one of the best scenes together when this movie is still promising. But the pressure to marry action with psychology, and to increase the stakes with such disregard for realism really starts working against the film and characters. I don't mind violence in movies at all, but it should make me invest in characters, not get desensitized and bored.I like a good battle of character like everyone else, but when the action and suspense start feeling stale because I'm no longer emotionally engaged, then it's just mostly a waste of time. But granted, it's not a complete disaster and it had its moments. I hear people praising this movie as super-suspenseful, so by all means, try it out. But don't say I didn't warn you.\",\n",
       " \"Let's just start off with this, It Is A Movie.It just kills me when people carry on about believability when watching a fast paced action thriller. What are the odds of someone living through something like this vouching for the realities of the situation? In all honesty, most of us like to think we know what we would do but is there a chance that the pressure, fear and self preservation of the moment could alter our decision making skills? I think it could and I chose to look at films like this with that in mind. These were the decisions they made in the moment and only the absolutely absurd should fall into a category of unrealistic.I liked this. Russell Crowe was fantastic in his portrayal of a fed up lunatic. He really did a great job. I thought the story could have benefited with a bit more backstory on the characters but it was decent. The action scenes were well choreographed and the special effects were nicely done. It was a tense ride for sure and it got pretty brutal at times. I'm a horror buff so that is right up my alley but I read a review that described it as torture porn and it's not that bad unless you are a total lightweight.I know this will be a film I watch more than once.

This movie just had zero redeeming qualities, i was perfectly ok with just walking out because i could care less what was happening or going too.The movie was basically torture porn, over the top unrealistic moments designed to shock the audience but it just falls flat on it's face. Also zero interesting dialogue, coupled with super generic progression and ending. I can see why they wanted to make this one of the first movies to come out since COVID-19 to sucker people into seeing this hot trash, otherwise this movie wouldn't make a dime. I wish i would have held out a couple more weeks to see a real movie like Tenet.As me and the wife we're exiting the theater i overheard two other couples saying the exact same thing that the movie sucked, made no sense, etc.Save your money.

       " \"Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the number one problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such in coherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent in developing these characters for their introduction to the big stage. Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at some points. But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and a great villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn't make sense because the movie itself went in so many directions that none of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a total failure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls so flat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster. This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority of the casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. I really think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast would be Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of Rick Flag was out of touch of what that character should be and for Enchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should have been chosen over Cara Delevingne. The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better movie than Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. A weak six stars and a onetime watch.\",\n",

However, the plot is so muddled and choppy it detracts from the viewing experience. Another weak link is the enemy - no real backstory to draw us in, almost no explanation on what the enemy is building, and almost laughable minions for the \"heroes\" to combat.There are so many cool characters, I think the movie and plot would have been better served if this had been Part I of a series, rather a stand alone movie.I read an article that stated David Ayer only had six weeks to put a script together and it unfortunately it shows. I felt like I was watching a long trailer - cool and fun scenes that were disconnected from each other.I certainly won\\'t say to pass on this, especially comic book fans, but be warned it is a let down.

       " \"To start it off, i'm a big fan of dc cinematic universe, and the year 2016, hadn't been a good year for me and the other fans. Even though, i'll state myself optimistic, since actually, all my hopes and expectation fall into this movie instead. OK, Let's start with the strong aspects of the movie; performances and characters. well, i actually think this is what the director want to top off and show to the audience, thus forgetting the plot, which we will get into later. but the characters and the performances are well-performed- Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn really tops off my expectation. i'm a fan of harley quinn character, and she actually brought me the harley quinn i'm expected for- sexy, beautiful, it girl of joker's. while watching the movie, and whenever i'm feeling bored, harley quinn is there to make the scene fresh. and i think all audience, including audiences who didn't know her will love her and feel sympathetic to her. Will smith as deadshot actually didn't deserve much of my appreciation. i mean even though he's one of the great and strong aspect in the movie, i just thought i don't see will smith even trying to act, which weirdly works. watching Will smith here is just watching him using a kickass suit. Jared Leto as The Joker, is actually isn't the worst part of the movie (unlike what people might have said) i think that Jared Leto pull of a great effort into his character, and some scene of him showing up gave me goosebumps and own joys. but, maybe how little the scene for him is, or his character is pretty under-developed that just doesn't fit the puzzle in the movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller also brought up my her characther pretty well, as she played the cold-hearted leader Amanda Waller. other performances are great, like Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Karen Fukuhara, and Cara Delevigne.The chemistry between the characters are great, as well as the development between their relationship. in my opinion, one of the strongest chemistry is Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Their chemistry is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together. even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is Rick Flagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, and unnecessary. Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plot is the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under-developed,and at some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it too much, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch the movie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI is pretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between the scenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think they could do better after building up the story of the fight scene.At the end, everything has its bad and has its good, what i really suggest for you to do is just lower your expectation, yet don't miss it either. it may not lift the hype as in the greatness in the trailer, but i think it's still a great fun must see summer movie , and you should enjoy it without all the overly negative critics.GUYS IM KIDDING THIS IS THE WORST FILM EVER DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY ON IT.\",\n",
       " \"Brilliant cinematography, real planes flying, real destruction of planes, the most real as possible, that's always great for films and it's one of Nolan's best quality as a director, he want real things happening on camera,\\nand of course Hans Zimmer original score is also brilliant.The non-linear narrative is intelligent, the mole sequences fell longer, in a good way, because the characters spend 1 week there, the sea sequences are a little bit more faster because the characters spend 1 day there and the air sequences are even faster because the characters spend 1hour there, when the 3 got together is the climax, or at least should be, that's is when the non-linear storytelling gets a little messy, some of the sequences in the third act are not puted in the best way, but the whole movie is so extremely well made in his technical stand points, written full of suspense and with an amazing original score by Hans Zimmer, that a lot people's don't realize that or they just don't care.The most negative point like i said is that some scenes don't fit very well in the non-linear agitation of the film, especially in the last half hour, and for a non-linear movie this is bad, but like i said, with all the qualities that this films has, this is not going to ruin the experience to watch.This film is also not made to be most remembered about the acting, which is not necessarily a bad thing, some peoples also says that the characters are kinda weak, which is not actually true, sure they are not as strong like the characters in Saving Private Ryan for example, but they are strong, the film just don't focus too much on them, the film is most interested on what happened in Dunkirk during that particular time in World War II. All that said, Mark Rylance is really good in this movie, he has the best lines and Cillian Murphy is also very good.\",\n",
       " \"Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle.And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet.\",\n",
       " 'This movie is so paper thin I really can\\'t write much about it. So many missed opportunities in a film about one of the most spectacular and complex battles of WWII. I can see what Nolan tried to do here, a kind of British \"Thin Red Line\" (there\\'s even wind in the grass, lol, i kid you not), but he failed spectacularly. There are no memorable characters to be found here, and one wonders even if there are any actual characters at all. Not one, not one of them has any semblance of a character arc. Not one. Again, I see how Nolan tried to convey the impersonality of war and insignificance of the individual but he did it with such a heavy, clumsy hand, providing us with no counterpoint with which to drive the point home. It\\'s basic screen writing stuff really. I\\'d expect such ineptitude from a first year film student but not from a supposed \"master of the craft\".But anyways, this could have been forgivable if the film was more about the event itself, but it fails at that too. After watching the film, you\\'d be given to believe that the Battle of Dunkirk was fought by three Spitfires (100 were lost over the beeches alone), 1 German heinkel, a couple of stukas, 2 destroyers or a dozen or so boats... Oh yes and maybe a few hundred men standing quietly on a beach, doing nothing except desperately trying to look morose and dejected in a faintly passive-aggressive way. It\\'s ridiculous. We are talking about total and absolute chaos happening there, hundreds of thousands of rifles alone discarded on the beach, not to mention guns, artillery, trucks... Burning and sinking ships of all sizes all across the horizon, parts of beaches inaccessible from rotting corpses washing up with tides. This was actually way bigger than D-Day landings in terms of men and equipment stuffed in a very small patch of land. Half a million desperate men stuffed in a small town, bombarded incessantly and under constant attack from bombers. Where did all those people defecate, what did they eat ffs? I wanted to know that, really. That at least would have given some much needed humanity to the so-called-characters Nolan keeps yanking around like so much puppets. So many missed opportunities there...If Nolan wanted to do a tight little film about isolation and desperation of being on the loosing side of the war, he had plenty of other places and battles to choose from. Just ask around. Or if he simply had to insist on Dunkirk, then we should have seen this total chaos all around our protagonists, in the background at least - that would have served as a really powerful, so desperately needed counterpoint to the individual suffering and heroism.And this brings me to the final point. The movie is one tone only. A monotone repetition of sights and emotions we\\'ve seen and experienced before. No one cracks a joke. No one really breaks down. No one has an embarrassing moment. There are no ups and downs, it\\'s just some morose faceless robots performing obvious actions leading towards a bleedingly obvious goal. One single emotional and narrative tone from the beginning to the end. The entire emotional and narrative content of the movie would have fit snugly into a 20 minute short, and that is pretty much how long it takes before you start yawning. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that individual scenes are well directed and worth experiencing. But that is the real problem here - the film is constructed as a series of impressive \"experiences\" rather than cohesive piece of drama (And this particular historical event is almost uniquely stuffed with dramatic opportunities. It\\'s almost as if golden-age Hollywood writers wrote the script for the actual event.) In other words, it\\'s a Dunkirk theme park rather than a movie. You take rides. And that\\'s it. And even those become repetitive after a while.',\n",
       " \"Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though. So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it.\",\n",
       " 'If you read through the swarm of negative reviews, you might notice a common theme: boring, dull, lack of characters. It\\'s incredibly disappointing that they seemed the miss the entire point of the film.This is not a film about heroic soldiers triumphing against all odds while blowing up Nazis with transformer-esque explosions.This is a movie about scenes, not characters. -and every scene is memorable, from the bombings to the torpedoes to the aerial dogfights. My co-worker, who is obsessed with WW2 planes, noted how incredibly perfect they got the British Supermarine Spitfire from the roar of the Rolls-Royce engine to the rattle of the components in the cabin. The accuracy and intensity of the dogfight was captured perfectly as well, mimicking the aerial maneuvers, firepower and damage in a realistic and dramatic fashion. The torpedoes noticed only moments before impact with it\\'s slow monotonous movement sent chills of realization down my spine. Even in the beginning of the film, the way in which the Nazi leaflets were presented gave you some glimpse into the panic and anxiety felt by those soldiers.I felt the \"lack of characters\" was realistic and served the film as well. War is not about larger-than-life personalities with specialized weapons being bad-asses. It\\'s about nameless and faceless soldiers facing an existential crisis, the possibility of randomized death, and how they can either respond with despair or hope.If you want characters you can root for and a happy ending where the bad guy in vanquished, then there are plenty of movies for you. But if you want a small glimpse into the despair, anxiety, hope, courage, and will of the British WW2 fighters then there is no better film ever made than this one.',\n",
       " \"A lot of posts focus on the 'coming of age' aspect of this movie, but the very overlooked part is the role it played in helping to alleviate many of the stereotypes a very Asian phobic America was after WWII, Korea and Vietnam.They make a point of showing Miyagi in a US Army Uniform--and a War Hero-- and makes references to detention camps Miyagi's family was sent to (a horribly dark period in American history)...where Miyagi's wife was being sent (pregnant) and where she and his unborn child (son) ultimately die during childbirth. There are also a few scenes in which ethnic slurs are used by rednecks toward Miyagi.Taking this into light, and taking the fact that Daniel has no father that we know of in this movie, the name Daniel-san (sounds like Daniel-SON) helps demonstrate a father son bond that is overlooked. Much of the conversation between Daniel and Miyagi is about Miyagi's great father in Okinawa, because Miyagi has acquired all this knowledge and wants to share it. Daniel substitutes for the son Miyagi never had and Miyagi substitutes for the father Daniel doesn't have.\",\n",
       " 'Lucille Larusso (Randee Heller) moves with her teenage son Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio) from Newark, New Jersey, to Reseda, California to work in a better job in Rocket Computer Company. Daniel meets a neighbor in his building and tells him that he fights karate; the neighbor invites him to go to a party on the beach. Daniel meets the gorgeous and wealthy Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue) that lives in Encino and they immediately feel attracted by each other. However, the bully Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) comes with his gang of bad boys and argues with Ali, who was his former girlfriend. Daniel defends her and is beaten up and humiliated by Johnny in front of his new friends. Then Daniel is frequently bullied by Johnny and his four inseparable friends at school. One night, Daniel is saved by the handyman Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki \\'Pat\\' Morita), who was born in Okinawa, from Johnny and his friends and he asks the old man to teach him karate. Mr. Miyagi heals Daniel and goes to academy where Johnny and his friends learn karate and he asks their violent instructor John Kreese (Martin Kove) to order his students to give a break in the beatings; in return, he accepts that Daniel participates in an all-valley tournament two months later. Now Mr. Miyagi begins his non-orthodox training of Daniel, especially movements and balance waxing cars and painting fences. \"The Karate Kid\" is a cult-movie of many generations. I do not recall how many times I have seen this film, in the movie theater, on VHS and now on DVD, and I still love it. In the 80\\'s, Ralph Macchio was a sensation with \"The Outsiders\", \"The Karate kid\" and \"Crossroads\" and his chemistry with Noriyuki \\'Pat\\' Morita in \"The Karate Kid\" is something very special. This coming of age story discloses a beautiful friendship of Daniel and Muyagi; the discovery of the first love, with the romance of Daniel and Ali; and the message relative to the importance to find balance in life. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Karatê Kid – A Hora da Verdade\" (\"Karate Kid - The Moment of Truth\")',\n",
       " 'I am a kid of the 80\\'s, no doubt about it. This movie meant a lot to me back when I was growing up. I never really took karate and I wasn\\'t really bullied, but it is great to remember a time when profanity wasn\\'t needed for humor, or vulgarity, or shootings or blowing up buildings.A time when the \" good guy \" would adhere to the rules and had morals. A time when the \" bad guy \" had no honor, but would rarely curse...lol. ( Hey, this was a PG movie after all, wasn\\'t it? LOL. ) \" Oh, I think nothing of cheating and being mean, because THAT\\'S what makes the audience dislike me and root for the hero, but I just can\\'t use filthy words. \" I miss that.I love the movie because it takes me back to my childhood and a simpler time. A good guy and a bad guy, with the good guy coming out on top. If the \" good guy \" curses like a sailor, shoots everyone that gets in his way, and does everything vile imaginable, he\\'s not really that good of a guy, is he?Yeah, I\\'m \" old school. \" So what?',\n",
       " \"So I have not yet started Cobra Kai and I have heard it is great and the new season has just hit Netflix. Before I can start that show though I decided that I had to re-watch The Karate Kid trilogy in order to remember the exact story and that starts here with The Karate Kid and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a teenager get help from a Karate Master to teach him to stand up for himself.Main Character\\nRalph Macchio didn't really end up with a huge career after his role as Daniel Larusso, but in terms of this film I think he is really good as the lead. He is just a pretty likeable kid and you want to see him succeed. Yes he is a bit hot headed but I thought that added a bit to his character and seeing him train in these strange ways gets you more invested and at least for me by the end of the film I really wanted to see him succeed in his quest.Supporting Character\\nThe legendary Pat Morita plays Mr Miyagi and he is amazing here, so much show that he got an Oscar nomination for his performance. The relationship between Danny and him is fantastic and they are the heart of the movie for me, this mentor and student relationship is great and you see the respect between the two of them which makes there journey together so satisfying. Elizabeth Shue plays Danny's romantic interest and I thought she was really good too, they just had really good chemistry together and were a cute couple that you want to see make it through the film and have a happy ending. The rest of the cast are great too William Zabka as Johnny and Randee Heller as Kreese are really good antagonists and I can't wait to see what is in store for them when I get around to Cobra Kai.Story\\nThe story is really heartfelt, the relationship between Danny and Miyagi is fantastic and really heartfelt and you really end up rooting for them and want to see Danny end up getting one over Johnny and Kreese. As I mentioned the romance is also good and even though there is a little hint of a love triangle it never forces itself into that trope which was a really good decision. No spoilers here but lets just say the plot is pretty predictable, you know exactly where it is going but in a film like this I don't see that as an issue as you want the nice and predictable ending. My one criticism is the execution of the ending, to me it felt like it was very sudden, the film just needed another few minutes to really wrap up its story and that would have made it perfect.Script\\nThe script is fine, it actually has some funny moments that had me chuckling quite a bit and the drama did work for the most part. I do though find it sometime in these films from the eighties is that the scripts aren't great and that is fine but now it is 2021 I just feel it has to be mentioned as a negative in my personal opinion.Style\\nThe style is great, all the different training that we see Miyagi use is fun and the montage really works and this film managed to make Karate feel pretty hardcore and violent. The film flows very nicely and even when the more personal scenes are happening it feels really good and adds weight to this story that isn't exactly new in its formulae.Overall\\nOverall, I think this film is great, The Karate Kid is a pretty iconic film and is basically the teenage version of Rocky and it does it really well. If you haven't seen The Karate Kid for some reason then give it a watch and you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"Two episodes in so far, as a Daredevil fan it's exactly what I hoped for. I am a huge fan of the Daredevil comics, my favourite run being by Bendis and Maleev, and this show is how you would imagine a Daredevil TV show being. It's a dark, gritty sombre affair with some great action, there is a fight scene in episode two which is truly amazing.Talking about action the best part for me is the action feels very realistic and brutal unlike the Daredevil film with its over the top wire work. Also very good in this show is the way his powers aren't shown in any fancy way, no sonar view or anything like that, it just emphasise his listening. The actors are all great too and the plots are compelling, just now I have nothing bad to say about this show.When marvel got back the rights to Daredevil I was a little apprehensive of how they would portray his character, no worries there now I've seen it, or if they would use the character at all. I was worried if he did get his own show/film it'd be like the rest of the Marvel films/shows, light hearted action with great fan service and a good helping of comedic moments, which wouldn't of suited the dark world of Daredevil. But I can safely say to all you fellow hornhead fans that they have nailed everything about Daredevil perfectly.I would highly recommend this show to Daredevil fans and fans of darker heroes like Batman, fans of the current MCU films/shows might not like the tonal change from those films/shows but it's exactly what the character needed. Now excuse me while I go watch some more! 10/10\",\n",
       " 'Like many comic-book fans I was expecting the worst from this movie. This is not because the character has any less depth than other super-heroes, but I knew that it would be extremely difficult to transition Steve Rogers to film in a serviceable way. The guy is called \"Captain America\" for heaven\\'s sake.Any comic-book reader would probably appreciate the ironies and idiosyncrasies behind such ostentatiously patriotic code-name, mostly because in print Cap has challenged the assumptions behind his symbolism, becoming a more conflicted and universal figure.But its hard to translate any of this idiosyncrasy successfully in 2 hours. Fortunately the film, instead of getting to political, is more old-fashioned pulp like Indy or \"Sky Captain,\" which thankfully never takes itself too seriously (which was one of the flaws of \"Thor\").I had my doubts that Chris Evans could pull off the modesty and heart needed for the role, but I was wrong. As the Red Skull, Hugo Weaving was wonderfully evil in a nostalgic, serial-villain kind of way. Haley Atwell is a sidekick/love-interest with the rare quality of not being incredibly annoying, and Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as Tommy Lee Jones.The reason I found this to be a good movie was because I enjoyed it, plain and simple. It\\'s well-photographed and well-acted. Like its titular hero, it modestly embraced its silliness, creating a charming B-movie experience.',\n",
       " \"Captain America: The First Avenger is a pretty decent film by its own merits. Showing the good old retro style and production design, since this film is directed by Joe Johnson who is capable of portraying the old times perfectly. Chris Evans did a great job as Captain America. Some of the action scenes are disappointingly unexciting but at least the CGI effects are eye candy. The movie ends with true patriotic heroism and full of heart. Definitely not new but it's still enjoyable.The trope of Captain America: The First Avenger has been reused by so many superhero movies. A good guy who is a weakling became powerful then eventually saves the day. It's definitely not innovating even for the people who've never read the comics but it's a relic. Well made production design & the old fashion score. Most battle scenes are montages. The action scenes are large. It can be watchable but some of them are pretty bland and poorly directed.The joys and the thrills mostly goes to the performances. Nothing goes wrong with Chris Evans. He did a decent job as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Hugo Weaving is fun to watch by his campiness and menace for the Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones is the comic relief here. The special effects are everywhere. Skinny Chris Evans and the background of the 1940s. Well, they are good enough for this film.Plenty of things worked in the end. Captain America: The First Avenger is a relic in its old fashion style but a little messy when it comes to the editing of the action scenes, but it's still enjoyable. Patriotic heroism, full of heart, Chris Evans, and decent production design. Marvel Studios and Joe Johnston really beats the awful 1990s version. The action could have been better but their flaws can be ignored. It's fun enough as a superhero movie.\",\n",
       " 'As I remembered the versions of 1979 (TV movies with Reb Brown) or the lame version of 1991 with Matt Salinger, I was just hoping this time, this movie will do good with Captain America as the main subject.And what a ride it was. I know that Captain America (Steve Rogers) was a soldier, so expecting some war movie along with the superhero fare. Joe Johnston not only caught the essence of the American Hero, but this time, no bulked up effects nor fake violence. This is really the Marvel hero and first Avenger who we are seeing here...All the actors were good in it. Very surprised to see Hugo Weaving doing a believable Red Skull (I remember the one in 1991 was horrible...) and when you see Tommy Lee Jones doing army stuff, we gotta believe it, he gives depth...Chris Evans gives Steve Rogers/Captain America a brand new perspective, far from Reb Brown\\'s botched up costume or Matt Salinger\\'s bland personification. Hope he keeps the momentum in \"The Avengers\"...And of course, the \"Stan Lee\" moment is not to be missed with a quip from the creator himself...',\n",
       " \"2011 is certainly the year for Marvel Studio, seeing that Thor came out earlier in the year to good reviews and a healthy box-office considering he is a lesser known hero and Captain America has done even better with critics and a stronger opening. Added to that Fox's reboot of X-Men was able to get that series right after the mess Brett Ratner left it in.Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a small, skinny man with a number of health problems who wants to fight in the American Army in 1942. After numerous times of trying to enlist a German scientist, Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his determination and good heart is able to pull some strings and gets him into the army. Rogers joins a special unit and is seen as the perfect candidate to become America's first super soldier, giving him enhanced strength, speed and healing abilities. In Germany the Nazi's secret science division, HYDRA and its leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) discovers a blue cube of energy and believes it could give him the power of the Gods and likes all mad scientists plans to take over the world. In America Rogers is made into a performing act, encouraging the public to buy war bonds and given the name Captain America. But Rogers wants to fight in the war and is given his chance to take on HYDRA in 1943.I personally preferred Thor over Captain America, but it still a fun summer flick and a solid 7.5/10. Captain America has plenty of references to Thor and the Iron Man films and shows how these franchise should be interlinked. Captain America is able to mix a light touch but making sure it treats the source material with respect and keeps it serious. Joe Johnston wouldn't have been my first choice to direct this film but certainly made it fun and he was more assured as an action director compared to Kenneth Brangh, director of Thor. It was a fast paced actioneer, but Johnston made sure they was enough time to let us know the characters and the set up for the plot. When Captain America first gains his powers the scene of him catching an assassin on top of a taxi reminded me a lot of the first Spider-man film, a film that got mix of serious and light-hearted right. This was certainly a good introduction to character and the start for what should be another successful adaptation for Marvel.The humour throughout the film is deadpan and there are very good performance from the supporting cast, especially Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Tucci. Weaving certainly knows how to portray evil characters. Evans was able to instill Captain America's values of determination, freedom, strength and being a force for good. But the thing about Captain America is that he is a classic hero, living in a world of absolutes of good and evil, they is no ambiguity. And well, Hayley Atwell is a token Brit so she gets a free pass.The score by Alan Silverstri it self has an old fashion, grand feel to it and there were reminds to films such as the first Hellboy film, starting during World War Two with the Nazis using mythology to gain an advantage to win the war and classic 60s and 70s war films like Where Eagles Dare.Captain America is an enjoyable blockbuster and necessary viewing if you plan to view The Avengers in 2012.\",\n",
       " \"The fifth movie released in Marvels MCU and the first appearance of Captain America played by (Chris Evans) though this isn't the first big screen adaptation of the red, white and blue hero this is hands down the best which isn't surprising seeing as the last time Marvel tried to do a Captain America movie was in 1990 and not only did it fail to capture the awsome comics but it made comic book fans in the 90s look like they read kids comics which simply isn't the case as many people now know after getting into the comics after the massive success and popularity of Marvel and the MCU as a whole in the past ten years.Captain America switched things up a bit with it's storyline instead of introducing Captain America in the modern day the movie takes place in the 1940s during World War II and tells the story of a young, short, skinny guy with asthma from Brooklyn named Steve Rogers who is determined to serve his country become the strong and courageous Captain America by becoming the world's first super soldier with a pure heart and kind spirit in a story that sees him fight Nazi soldiers and take on the evil Red Skull (Hugo Weving) the leader of Hydra a secret evil cult set on world domination and their new weapons of destruction only the shield wielding hero in the red, white and blue can save the day.This movie also introduces us to Agent Carter (Haley Atwell) who is Steve Rogers love interest in the movie who would later get her own TV series Agent Carter where her character gets much more back story and kicks ass like she should she is also one of the founding members of Shield along with Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) who is also in the movie as basically the MCU version of Q from the 007 movies. Captain America also gives us the first appearance of Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who plays the character very well the makeup effects and black leather outfit actually make Red Skull look kinda scary and intimidating sadly the only other appearance of this character in the MCU to date is in Avengers Infinity War which was seven years after this movie and was only in the movie for a few minutes.This is probably one of the best hero origin story's in a comic book movie because the movie shows us Captain America as just plain old Steve Roger's to start with before he got his powers and we get to see the kind of man he is before he gets his powers and honestly it really makes Captain America feel more relatable as a character because we see ourselves in this regular guy who wants to do good in the world and fight back against the bullies of the world again and again and then when he does get his powers we see him stay true to himself the power doesn't change or corrupt him it instead gives him the means to do what he always wanted to do make a difference in the world and stand up to the bullies of the world no matter what form they take and that's something this movie got right about the comics Captain America was always a symbol of strength and courage to people who read the comics as children and gave us a hero to look up to the very first avenger.The special effects are again top quality which isn't surprising after Marvel started to get a much higher budget after every movie before this one in the MCU were such big hits and made a ton of money at the box office.I highly recommend watching Captain America The First Avenger if your a fan of the comics and the MCU as a whole even if you're not interested in watching every movie in the MCU I would still recommend watching this one as it stands out on it's own and is the best movie interpretation of Captain America out there.\",\n",
       " 'I had the pleasure of watching a sneak preview for this and thought it was a great superhero movie. It follows the \"superhero formula\" but that\\'s to be expected. There are plenty of references to the comics as well as the other Marvel movies. There are numerous comic book references and foreshadowing that I probably can\\'t even write here but will excite most of the comic book fans. In fact, Howard Stark plays a prominent role in this film and you see where Tony Stark gets his charm. The movie really captures that patriotic spirit that permeated the US during WW2. The movie itself almost becomes like one of those military recruitment ads it showcases. It is chock full of flag-waving patriotism. But you probably should expect that going to a movie called \"Captain America.\"Chris Evans is a good Captain America and downplays any flashiness associated with him as the Human Torch. The CGI effects that show him as a scrawny twig were seamless. He carries that vulnerability with him throughout the film whether he is getting beaten up physically or emotionally. The rest of the cast fills their roles well- especially Tommy Lee Jones as the gruff, but lovable, colonel and Hugo Weaving as the evil baddie bent on wold domination. Those two play their characters the way you would expect them to. Although I was waiting the whole time for Hugo Weaving to say \"Mr. Anderson.\" The only odd twist is that Captain America\\'s sidekick from the comics, Bucky Barnes, is much tougher and older than you\\'d expect. There are numerous one-liners throughout the movie that drew chuckles from the audience. You also get plenty of action and explosions which are always a crowd favorite. Stylistically, it\\'s very similar to Iron Man. Overall, it\\'s a fun comic book adaptation that really adds into steam Marvel is building up to with The Avengers. Nice work.',\n",
       " 'Despite going in with incredibly low expectations, I was horrendously disappointed by Thor. It was everything I hoped it would not be, and made me worry about Captain America: The First Avenger. Even with my excitement over that film, Thor\\'s romp through the desert made me incredibly apprehensive to think Cap\\'s adventure would be worthwhile.After a short modern day intro, we are thrust into wartime in 1940s New York. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to fight for his country -- but has been turned away five times for health ailments and his size. Shortly after another attempt, Rogers is intercepted and quickly chosen for a Super Soldier project the US is quietly developing. He is turned into Captain America, the soldier that will help turn the tides and end the war. But while he is selling war bonds, the German science division HYDRA run by Johann Schmidt, better known as the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), is gaining more power behind enemy lines. And obviously, Rogers cannot just let that slide. I will immediately say that Thor does not deserve to breathe the same air as Captain America: The First Avenger. Minutes into the film, you know immediately where Marvel was focusing its attention all along and why Thor felt so undercooked. This film is without a doubt, the best superhero film since the one-two punch of Iron Man and The Dark Knight in 2008. Anyone weary of it being a period piece should rest at ease, as this is one of the most unique entries into the genre to date. The time period only helps bring the characters to life even more vividly than they already are depicted on-screen. But the reason the origin story works so well is because it is so wildly different than everything that has come before it. Captain America is a movie that feels right at home in the 1940s and transcends itself into the time period. From Rogers\\' introduction on, Joe Johnston frames the film with a sense of wonder, imagination and authenticity. Much like Inglourious Basterds before it, this is a reconstructed history. But it is done so convincingly that you may second guess yourself, trying to picture whether this very real world is actually what really happened. Johnston also layers the film with an aura of fascination and bewilderment, frequently leaving the audience in the same disbelief as the characters. When Rogers is discovering his new abilities for the first time, we feel the exact same way. But instead of embracing this astonishing feeling and letting the film breathe life into a genre that is on its last legs, it fumbles and takes us away from it all too quickly. While the first half plays out beautifully, developing the world and its characters, the second half amps up the gas and zips by without a thought for explanation or near sighted investigation. It felt like the filmmakers realized they took too long developing everything, and decided to just rush through the rest without stopping to think whether the audience would notice or not. But once you notice all of the montages, and how there is zero explanation on who the \\'Howling Commandoes\\' are, you know Marvel may have missed out on a few crucial steps along the way of story development.For the most part, Captain America: The First Avenger is a deeply focused and ridiculously invested story of the origins of an extraordinary soldier who just wants to do his part for his country. Yes, Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) is an important character in the film, but he is the only real tie to the rest of the Marvel film canon. But as the film draws to a close, the tacked on ending starts, and suddenly, Marvel\\'s investment in Cap suddenly turns into just another agenda pushing entry for The Avengers. It is sad and disappointing, but after four films, I should have assumed they would not have suddenly changed tactics.After playing such a great Johnny Storm, I was worried that Evans would not have the chops, charisma or gravitas needed to play Captain America. Was I ever wrong. He is absolutely flawless in the role, quickly shifting from scrawny weakling to beefy hero with ease. He remains throughout as a boy from Queens, and the look of wonder and awe in his eyes never dissipates. No matter what he is doing, Evans maintains the character, and never even considers becoming anything other than a loyal boy scout. He is a true hero through and through, and watching him in action makes me wonder why it took this long for a good Captain America film to be released.While his accent is imperfect, Weaving is exquisitely evil as the Red Skull. He is downright disturbing in some instances, and deliciously over-the-top in others. I cannot imagine anyone being as brooding and insanely evil as he is here. Cooper, Sebastian Stan, Toby Jones and Tommy Lee Jones all give excellent performances in their roles. Relative newcomer Hayley Atwell also shines in her role as the hardnosed Peggy Carter. Her subtle romance and chemistry with Evans is magnificent, as are her ability to effortlessly create a strong female lead. Special mention also must go to Stanley Tucci, whose Dr. Abraham Erskine is a welcome departure from his atypical roles as of late.While it botches any attempts at perfection (and really did not need to be post converted to 3D), Captain America: The First Avenger still manages to be a wildly entertaining adventure that is even more impressive than you may imagine. Evans is amazing in the role, and the whole film is ridiculously pulpy fun. And I dare you to not feel a warm feeling of nostalgia while humming along to the deliriously catchy \"Star Spangled Man\" propaganda jingle. It makes the film worthwhile all on its own.8/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).',\n",
       " \"I knew nothing about Captain America prior to viewing this Marvel film. Many people were skeptical about Chris Evans being cast as the man in red, white, and blue mainly because he is previously known for playing Johnny Storm in the not so fantastic Fantastic Four movies. Despite, the fact that he had a lot of pressure going into this film, I thought he did a fare job. I personally don't think this was the best Avengers tie in movie but it was fine. The first half of the movie did a very good job of establishing the story behind the creation of this man and how he was initially just an experiment and then turned into a propaganda piece for the war in order to excite people and inspire them to fight the fight. Afterward, when he finally does take initiative and attempts to infiltrate and destroy the enemy, the movie turns into a pretty standard and generic action movie. Hugo Weaving is cast as the villain known in the comics as the Red Skull. Despite a good looking face (a red face), he never really becomes too menacing and isn't given enough screen time as the red skull to really effect us. Tommy Lee Jones is in his realm as an army commander who is in charge of operations including Rogers and is very funny as well as delivering the lines extremely well. Speaking of lines, this movie doesn't have the best or worst script and I think they (the writers) could have spent more time developing better dialogue that didn't sound so rushed. Director Joe Johnston who is know for The Rocketeer brings the 1940s World War feeling to the screen brilliantly and with great set designers and art direction. Tony Starks father plays a fairly significant role as the man behind the suit and weapons of the Captain. Played by Dominic Cooper, we get an inside look at how Stark got his attitude and knack for building new technology. The 3D added nothing, which is not unusual nowadays. The only time it was ever apparent was when the shield was thrown towards the screen which happened maybe twice. This movie does a nice job of finishing the tie in movie for the upcoming epic Avengers movie die to release next year. My only hope is that all of this build up with the individual super hero movies is not wasted. This is worth a rental and I will probably buy this on blu-ray when the price is greatly reduced.\",\n",

You need not have seen the original 1960 film Spartacus to enjoy the series as they are not related.Warning - every episode contains nudity and explicit sex scenes. You have been warned.And don't forget to watch the 6 episodes of Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, which aired between seasons one and two, but could be watched after this series.

       " 'For me the pilot was something of a mix between the graphic violence of 300(it even includes somewhat similar battle sequences), the sex of 300, the idea of Gladiator and a bit of Rome. I almost stopped watching it and I\\'m glad I didn\\'t do it. People would see the first episode and dismiss it as \"gore and sex\" time-wasting perversity. And they would be mistaken. The plot, filled with at first glance one-dimensional characters, is so varied, so deep, full of plot twists and unpredictable outcomes that you may find yourself glued to the screen.The sex is still there, the sexy images as well(muscular men and beautiful women), but the characters have gained so much depth and perspective, that you can\\'t say someone is just white or black(with two exceptions). There are so many shades of gray in between, that most of the times even if you want to hate a character for plotting against the protagonist, you find yourself siding with him on another level. The protagonist is not a saint, the \"bad guys\" show they can love and cherish, and you see the other side of mighty Rome, the one not shown in \"Rome\". This show, even after the less than spectacular pilot, can be and for the moment is great and it\\'s not the gore or sex that make it so.In 300, Rome and even Gladiator, to which Spartacus: Blood and Sand is usually compared, the main characters are free men and women, people who act on their generally free will(yes, even in Gladiator). This show is different. Spartacus: Blood and Sand displays the Roman world through the eyes of the downtrodden, the helpless and the people without rights - the enslaved, THE underdogs, who eventually tried to defy the might of Rome, who lost and lost in an epic and tragic way and in their fall still achieved greatness and immortality. Among the nudity, spilling blood and duel sequences, Spartacus: Blood and Sand shows the viewer why freedom is such a cherished thing, what happens when we lose it and why people throughout time have risen to regain it and died pursuing it or defending it. Some people mock the characters for being \"one-dimensional\" and demand more complexity. Others have voiced their contempt of the less than accurate representation of \"the complex social system of Rome\". Spartacus: Blood and Sand does not seek to represent the social system. For the people at the bottom of the ladder it was irrelevant whether Sulla was killing senators or Pompeus was gaining power. As for the one-dimensional characters, let me pound the obvious and say this - when you have to kill a friend at the command of your master, or be killed as well, there\\'s no possibility for inner struggle or soul searching. You can\\'t really disobey your master when humiliation, rape, torture and death lie just a whim away.It\\'s early to say definitely whether Spartacus: Blood and Sand will be a great TV show. It certainly is for now and gets better and better. Unless the creators manage to screw up gigantically, which they have avoided so far, this child of Starz can become epic.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been looking very forward to the Starz original series \"Spartacus: Blood and Sand.\" And I\\'m happy to say that if you were looking forward to it, you\\'re in for a wild ride.They tell you right in the front of this show that this is meant to be an intense depiction of Rome. And it is to a certain point. There is definitely a ton of blood, language, and sexuality (one of the female characters is fully naked), but it is all there for a reason and it defines the characters, shows you who they are.Many won\\'t like this the same way they didn\\'t like 300. And I can say that no one will be able to watch this without thinking about 300, and that\\'s the biggest flaw. It has a speed up slow motion and blood flowing everywhere. It is one of the most graphic TV shows I\\'ve ever seen.However, if you liked 300 (which I did) and you see the slow motion as a way to rise the intensity and that the graphic violence/sexual content is meant to connect with the characters towards some degree, you will enjoy this show. But it\\'s not only a story full of blood and gore and sex and nudity; it also has a lot of character to it and a lot of substance.Andy Whitfield is brilliant as \"Spartacus.\" He drives the character and makes you feel for him. His acting is perfect. In fact, all the actors are incredible, including Lucy Lawless, Craig Parker, and John Hannah.The battle scenes in this show are outstanding. Again, very bloody, 300 style battles, but still entertaining. The gladiator fights are well shot and very gritty.I know it\\'s television and the visuals aren\\'t always the best, best the visuals in this show are gorgeous. There was one moment where it looked like a video game, but only for a second.it\\'s not only a story full of blood and gore and sex and nudity; it also has a lot of character to it and a lot of substance.So if you like sword and sandal epics and you don\\'t mind gore and nudity, Spartacus: Blood and Sand is the show for you. I personally thought it was a fun, kick ass, macho show, and while it does have a little too much sex and reminds me a lot about 300, it\\'ll definitely keep my attention for the next episode.Spartacus: Blood and Sand airs on Friday at 10 o\\' clock on Starz.',\n",
       " 'I was lucky enough to be included in the group to see the advanced screening in Melbourne on the 15th of April, 2012. And, firstly, I need to say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this film? It is, as the title of this review says a \\'comic book triumph\\'. I went into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.Seeing Joss Whedon\\'s direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed.While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... it\\'s no good having them spot on if you don\\'t have a cast that just isn\\'t right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors involved, Whedon\\'s cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and night.The actors\\' performances in \"Marvel\\'s The Avengers\" are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.All in all, Marvel\\'s The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be disappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedly.The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring. Ten out of ten.',\n",
       " 'I think any viewer, buying a ticket for this film, is aware of what he expects to see on the screen. Recently, the film industry has been criticized for the abundance of projects of a purely entertaining nature, including the \"Avengers\". However, if you look closely - it turns out that there is not so much really good and quality entertainment cinema. Some films are boring, some are bluntly stupid; and, for the most part, it turns out that \"entertainment\" can be called only a few luxuriously shot scenes, and at other times the viewer is forced to entertain himself with popcorn and cold cola. So the \"Avengers\" is a completely different case.I\\'m not a fan of comic books, and the attitude towards this genre is rather negative, because of its total zashtamovannosti and uncompromising pathos. However, seeing such a spectacle as the \"Avengers\", it\\'s hard not to leave your sarcasm aside, and fully enjoy the proposed attraction. Director Joss Weedon, in the beginning, caused me to distrust, in spite of the mass of laudatory reviews, his \"Mission Serenity\" did not impress me at all; However, in this case, a clear and confident direction is felt throughout the film. Weedon is also responsible for the script, and here I want to note how competently it is worked out to fill the picture with action to the eye, not forgetting about the meaningfulness and clear drawing of the characters\\' characters. It is a balanced scenario that makes the film look \"in one go,\" and the characters look so charismatic, as necessary for a positive perception of the picture.\\nUndoubtedly, Marvell approached the project very seriously, presenting \"Torah\" and \"First Avenger\" last year, these films being technically quite successful in themselves, at the same time became an effective prelude to the main movie event Marvel. And the creators did their best to make the film truly an event that surpassed its historical predecessors. Since almost all the characters are familiar to the viewer, and the story itself is simple and understandable - it makes it possible to fill the picture with spectacular action to the point that it seems unbelievable how all this can fit into one film, even if it lasts more than two hours. At the same time, this is not the case when the entire film is thrown at different locations, trying to diversify the action in this way. The bulk of events takes place on the ship Nick Fury and in New York, but everything is done so qualitatively that not how much it tires. The scene of the massacre in the city in the final is fascinating, although the \"scene\" is not called the language, because of its wide time frame. For a very long time the heroes will fight the enemy; everything will jump, fly and explode; and all this in an excellent high-quality 3D. And although the film is not without pathos, I was pleased that the question of the police \"Who are you to command here?\" Captain America did not begin to pronounce his name, which the Russian viewer perceives with his teeth, but simply showed in deed.Of course, there is a lot of humor in the film. However, if, for example, in the same \"Sea Battle\" creators used humor as a saving thread, literally pulling the picture from the abyss in certain places; in \"Avengers\" it is, albeit an obligatory, but an equal part of the overall structure, which works in a complex. This is not the option when you close your eyes to some flaws due to some pluses (an abundance of humor, for example) because there are no obvious shortcomings in all parameters of the production of the film. And the humor itself - yes, sometimes even stiff and sarcastic, chuckling over the heroes and reducing the extra degrees of pathos. In this regard, it is not superfluous to mention that Joss Weedon also had a hand in creating the scenario \"Huts in the Forest\", but here, of course, everything is in a softer framework.To say that \"Avengers\" is a typical entertaining movie would be fundamentally wrong - in fact Marvel was removed practically by the standard representative of the genre, which uses every minute of its timing as effectively as possible. Mass of spectacular action, magnificent picture in high-quality 3D, wonderful soundtrack, sarcastic humor and nice characters. It is this film that should be considered a grandiose opening of the summer season of blockbusters, as it really sets a very high level.',\n",
       " 'When I saw the trailer I thought \"Yea, I already know exactly how the story goes, but the deaging effects look nice\"So I went into it expecting not much, but at least some average entertainment. But oh boy, the movie is kinda hard to enjoy. The characters have no depth, the story is totaly bland and the action in it\\'s best moments is super average.I was right on both my predictions. The trailer already tells you the whole story and it does feel like you\\'ve already seen it before. And also, the creation of a young Will Smith totaly worked.The script is horrible and you can easily notice the flaws. There are some super obvious setups that are so randomly thrown in that you know it\\'s gotta be important later, just to then be disappointed that the payoff is even worse. Speaking of \"Bees\".Sometimes it feels like scenes are missing. Some actually important stuff just happens off-screen.The finale is disappointing and unspectacular and also the special effects are super whacky. People jump and run so fast that it looks like an early 2000s movie.Conclusion: Will Smith keeps picking mediocre movies, I can\\'t recommend you watching this, I was really bored.',\n",

Young Will Smith is probably the best looking CGI de-aging effect I\\'ve seen in a film (until the last scene).\\nThe cinematography was also really well-done, there are some interesting shots, especially one panoramic shot of a train whizzing by. And shots hold for much longer than the typical action film, often showing impressive long-take shots.\\nThe action is tense, with hard-hitting fight choregoraphy, as opposed to the \"cut away\" style many modern action films go with.\\nWill Smith, both young and old, delivers a very good performance as assassins struggling with their identity & place in the world, albeit in very different circumstances.\\nThe plot takes a bit to kick in to full gear, but once it gets rolling, it\\'s a thrilling ride some minor speed bumps.All in all, a solid Hollywood action film, it\\'s no masterpiece, but very enjoyable.',\n",

Music is by Lorne Balfe and cinematography by Dione Beebe.Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is an aging but elite assassin who's ready to call it quits. However, his plans are put on hold when he suddenly becomes the target of a mysterious operative who can seemingly predict his every move. The assassin who stalks him has a very familiar feel to him...Lets not beat around the bush, Smith and Winstead deserve a better screenplay than this. The writing is weak and lazy, Lee is clearly the wrong director for such a high concept action film, while the action scenes are shoddy in effects. In fact the storyline, as trite as it is, is unfairly in a constant battle against the CGI on show.However, film never sits still and refuses to let boredom take a hold. The lead actors are engaging enough to hold attention throughout, and even as the sugary coatings fill out the final throes, we at least can acknowledge there were earnest intentions to make an existential clone thriller here. But with Jerry Bruckheimer on production you can see there's a popcorn action film trying to break free of the literary treacle.Hardly the worst clone sci-fier that some have called it, but it's not memorable either. Think of it more as a time filler for the curious about the subject to hand. 6/10\",\n",
       " \"In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \\nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.\",\n",
       " \"With a B-list superhero, a risky lead actor, a genre that hasn't really done much other than say Nolan's Batman, this movie had a lot to prove. Wow, did it ever. It proved that superhero movies can be realistic, emotional, funny and have highly entertaining action. This is the movie to launch the MCU, and started the shared universe that DC comics and other franchises are following.Let's start with the number one reason why this movie is so good: Robert Downey Jr. I am so glad that Jon Favreau kept pressing the studio to make sure RDJ had this role because he completely nails it. He effortlessly portrays the cool, sarcastic, alcoholic, playboy that I don't even think he's acting. He's clearly not perfect as he is the guy we think is awesome but don't necessarily want to be. This role is basically synonymous with RDJ now because you can't think of Tony Stark without immediately thinking of RDJ. Iron Man wasn't a househeld name before but thanks to RDJ's performance, it is now.The action in this movie is incredible as you get to see him fly around, take on terrorist cells and fight the main villain. What I even found to more intriguing is Stark's entire time building his suit, both in the Afghan cave and in his garage because it is amazing to see his genius at work, while still being snarky and basically a tool.The writing and humor is also very good in this movie. I read that a lot of the lines, especially RDJ's were improv, which is able to keep this movie very fresh, not Rotten Tomatoes style, but it helps a lot by breaking the molds of superhero movies.A couple complaints in this film is the pacing and the final villain. The pacing starts off very well, not really rushing into him being Iron Man, establishing his character very well before his abilities. Then the final battle comes around and it's basically just an evil version of his character, which sort of works with the problem of his technology getting into wrong hands, but the fact that it's just fighting a mirror is kind of boring. The final battle comes around pretty quick and it resolved fairly quick as if they are trying to wrap it up really quickly. I did like Bridges' Obadiah Stane with his intimidating yet charming persona but in the end he was just a reverse of Iron Man, not that interesting.+ Robert Downey Jr + Fresh, new start for superhero movies + Writing and pacing (mostly) + Action and Humor - Final Villain Final Score: 9.3/10\",\n",
       " 'Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won\\'t dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they\\'re making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by \"Marvelizing\" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he\\'s done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I\\'ve said it before but it\\'s brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It\\'s a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn\\'t seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it\\'s all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film.',\n",
       " \"WOW WOW WOW.This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy!\",\n",
       " \"When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",
       " \"Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.Tony Stark, rich, handsome, incredibly wealthy, has it all. He also creates war weapons, when he goes to Afghanastan to introduce a new missile, he is captured and told to create the missile for the terrorists. But Tony has other plans, he creates a metal suit and escapes, he goes back home and announces that he wants to retire and close down Stark industries due to the violence he saw. But when he learns that the weapons of his are in the wrong hands, he realizes that maybe he could re-create a metal suit and become Iron Man, the incredible machine to save man kind.Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited. Even the soundtrack gets you pumped up and ready to root for Iron Man. The only complaint, as much as the action was cool, I wish it wasn't the war on terrorism they used, I know it's part of the story, but it hits so close, that it may seem inappropriate. The climax, a little cliff hanger, but I'm already smelling a sequel for next year probably. But Iron Man is a fun movie that all ages could enjoy, Iron Man is the new Spider Man for 2008! 8/10\",\n",
       " 'With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There\\'s something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we\\'re in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark\\'s life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father\\'s legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark\\'s, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark\\'s most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark\\'s secret identity, and you\\'d be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out. Who\\'s the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation\\'s existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan\\'s reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their \"hobby\", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season!',\n",
       " \"In the last couple of years, comic book based super hero movies have had a mission to accomplish and thats kick starting a franchise.The likes of Fantastic four, batman begins, daredevil and hulk to name a few, were made to be the start of a series. Iron man is no different, but where many of these sorts of films fail, Iron Man succeeds because it not only gets the series started but its a damn good film in its own right.Exciting, funny and well acted, iron man is an all round great effort that sticks surprisingly close to its source material. The high octane sequences where iron man soars through the air and kicks bad guys asses are awesome to watch but thankfully this is a film where things are just as interesting to watch when no one is blowing anything up and its all thanks to the Jon Favreau careful direction. The plot, in which billionaire tony starks turns from brash playboy to amour clad hero, is engaging and enthralling and favreaus eye for great acting ensures some great naturalistic performances.There are two stand out performances, the first and most important being Robert Downey Juniour as Tony Stark. Junior makes this role his own, injecting Tony Stark with a sense of cool, arrogance and an Errol Flynn like swagger that makes him really fun to watch and get behind as a leading man. The second (which surprisingly doesn't get as much praise as Downeys stark) is Jeff Bridges as bad guy Obadiah Stane. Although he could have played the role as a scenery chewing , typical villain, Bridges injects the role with a sense of realism and imposing menace, making for a convincing antagonist.Iron Man is what a marvel comic book movie should be- a mix of great story ,exciting action, and a faithful representation of a classic character.\",\n",
       " \"Until May 2008, the few releases this year that I've seen ranged from below average to downright rubbish with the exception of two movies. One being 'Iron Man'. This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie. This one has rich characters, it perfectly blends humour, drama, action and it has heart, all of which are presented on screen in a wonderful way that keeps the viewer staring at the screen right till the end. The writing is great as 'Iron Man' sticks to the main story all the way. I liked how Downey Jr's Tony Stark grows from this carefree business-minded tech-tycoon who's only concern is Stark Industries to a man with a mission to save the world and in the process he still stays the same person as he maintains his sense of humour, his courage and his integrity. The dialogues, especially Starks's one-liners are sharp, witty and funny. This movie is an introduction to the famous title character thus those expecting only action from start to end (like 'Transformers') may be disappointed to an extent. But for me there was enough action along with substance to make it a hugely enjoyable experience.Jon Favreau is proving to be a more versatile director and his impressive filmography, both as actor and director, prove that he's experimented with different kinds of cinema. 'Iron Man' wouldn't have been an easy film to direct but Favreau does a magnificent job. The CGI is excellent as I loved how much attention was given to detail and how the viewer is shown every step of the making of Iron Man. Of course, there's some humour added to lighten up the mood instead of technologically overloading the viewers.'Iron Man' is just the movie that Robert Downey Jr. needed and it couldn't have come at a better time. At a time, when this talented actor's performances were hardly getting enough notice, 'Iron Man' brings him back to recognition. After seeing him, one would conclude that the part was made only for Downey Jr. His dialogue delivery seems so natural that it would be hard to tell whether he was acting, if the scenes were taken out of context. I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow has ever looked better. Though the role does not allow her to really stretch her acting, Potts isn't just a typical superhero's dame. She is Tony's confidant and the one who supports him through thick and thin. Paltrow provides the necessary charisma, sex appeal and soul that makes Pepper Potts shine and she shares a sizzling chemistry with her male lead. Terrence Howard has a smaller role as Tony's good friend but there's a hint that he might have a more prominent role if a sequel is made. Finally, there's Jeff Bridges as the villain. An odd yet brilliant choice as the actor is refreshing and like his costar, he too needed an 'Iron Man' to give his career a boost.I noticed that some people were complaining that Muslims/Middle Easterners were portrayed as bad guys just like in any other American movie but I would like to state that this is no 'Vantage Point'. Here, these people weren't portrayed as terrorists working on their own but as men hired for a specific reason (I won't say more to give away spoilers). So I just thought to briefly clarify that this is no anti-Islamic or anti-anything (except, well okay, anti-weaponry) movie. It's a movie for everyone.Perhaps the story itself isn't anything novel which is what makes it somewhat similar to other superhero movies, but the treatment of it and its execution is quite unique. Add to that a fine cast and dazzling special effects among many things, this is the summer movie experience I've been waiting for in 2008. I wonder what else this summer has to offer as I doubt that it would succeed in providing anything close to the sheer entertainment of 'Iron Man'.\",\n",
       " \"Since Marvel Comics and CGI started their mystical marriage in the late 1990s, we've had superheroes galore. Hulks, Surfers, Spidermen, not to mention constantly renewed Batmans and Supermans. So what does Iron Man have to offer that's different? A flawed character that becomes honourable is the answer, triumphing in the battle of Good over Evil in spite of being a bit of a prat.Add to that some of the best features of Robocop, Batman Begins and Terminator II, and you have one of the more satisfying comic-books-turned-blockbuster that we've seen for a while.Billionaire and genius Tony Stark \\x96 with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes \\x96 is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. Forced to work for them, he has other plans. Stark, nicely played by Robert Downey Jr, fashions a hi-tech suit of armour - before going on to save the world in usual exemplary fashion.This long build-up \\x96 to explain how he becomes Iron Man \\x96 is arguably the best part of the film. Ingenious special effects give Stark's futuristic Malibu mansion a sci-fi rather than fantasy feel. And the subtle build-up makes us more forgiving as the story slips slowly into comic-book reality.There are, of course, compromises. It has to appeal to kids as well as adults, so there is none of the gutsiness of Terminator I (or similar adult-orientated sci-fi). And in spite of the heavy moral-political issues at stake, Iron Man stays politically bland \\x96 this being the only way to get D.O.D. approval and hence associated goodies like fighter jets and military hardware.One of the most interesting ideas for me in the film was the idea of 'zero accountability'. This takes the form of having all the wealth, brains and playboy attributes that fiction writers can imagine, but could also be a symbol for U.S. military might, for instance. Stark's first premise, of power being the ultimate deterrent (and hence a peace-keeping force) is undermined when the enemy gets hold of the same weapons and starts killing indiscriminately. Theologians might also muse how power itself has no moral authority. Good guys have to grudgingly beseech permission from whoever wields the biggest thunderbolt.Iron Man, essentially a symbol of power, abounds in biblical references, even if these come more from the comic book creators than any learning on the part of filmmakers. Jericho, the name given to Stark's finest military weapon, was the city that had to be destroyed, 'as an outward display of faith.' Which makes for great symbolism. Until you consider that modern-day Jericho is in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, and then Stark's 'rockets' start to look a lot more loaded.Iron Man's technology has a special feature to avoid targeting civilians. Now this is one military development I would love to see.The second half of the movie is pure action, but with a well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged. Out-of-reach love-interest materialises as Gwyneth Paltrow, who I found very agreeable to watch, and the excellent supporting cast also includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. This is a film that tries to please everyone and largely succeeds. It's a two-hour thrill-ride that offers a new action-hero for our CGI-sated palates.On a personal note, my big disappointment was the title track \\x96 or rather lack of it. Having heard one of the most famous heavy metal riffs of all time in the trailer, I couldn't wait to see Iron Man flying through the skies to the sound of Black Sabbath's rock anthem. Sadly, the riff is all you get (probably cos the words seem to be based on an altogether different story). But if you sit through the closing credits hoping for more, you do at least get a very important extra scene. So you've been warned: don't leave the cinema beforehand!\",\n",
       " 'The Punisher is an awesome superhero show, that isn\\'t really a superhero show. Frank Castle doesn\\'t have any special abilities, he\\'s just a former marine, seeking justice for what happened to his family. Because of this, The Punisher ends up being one of the most relatable heroes in that regard, right next to Daredevil. They\\'re two sides of the same coin.When The Punisher was first announced to be appearing in Daredevil season 2, I was beyond excited. Not only because, Punisher himself is one of my favorite characters, but because of the casting choice too. I initially knew Jon Bernthal as Shane Walsh on The Walking Dead, and he was phenomenal in it. I just knew that he would kill it as Frank Castle too, and he sure did. Thanks to the popularity of the character in Daredevil, a series featuring Punisher was announced, and I was ecstatic. After releasing its first season, the show didn\\'t disappoint. We got a better look into the character and intricacies of Frank Castle, and the show introduced us to a slew of supporting characters that are also compelling. In my opinion, The Punisher has the strongest supporting cast of the Marvel Netflix shows, right next to Daredevil itself.The action in this show is just off the charts. Along with Daredevil, the two easily have the best action scenes of any superhero shows out there. If I had to pick one, I\\'d say the Punisher\\'s scenes are slightly better though. The brutality of the Punisher makes for slightly more intense fighting sequences.Overall, The Punisher is a completely intense, brutal and well written show. The cast is amazing, with Jon Bernthal doing a phenomenal job as Frank Castle. Season 2 is also looking up, and continues the great quality of the series. The relationship between Frank and Amy is incredible. Also, some might say that it\\'s wrong to call The Punisher, Daredevil, etc \"superhero\" shows. But as the late, great Stan Lee said \"That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero.\" They don\\'t need to be \"super\" to be heroes.I just wanted to end the review on this note; it\\'s unfortunate that all of the Marvel Netflix shows have been canceled as of late. It seems equally likely that The Punisher will be canceled coming off of its second season in the month ahead sadly. I wanted to thank all of the cast and crew, not just of The Punisher, but from all of Netflix Marvel. The shows were really great, and it was enjoyable to experience another corner of the Marvel Universe through these series\\'. Hopefully these shows are somehow saved, because they still have tons of potential. Even still, after these shows being canceled, I still think that they are worthwhile. Check them out if you\\'re a Marvel fan, you won\\'t be disappointed!My Rating: 9.0/10',\n",
       " \"It took me a while to watch the second season but I though this show was just insanely good. The violence was perfect and the fight scenes were just awesome. Netflix has a lot of trash shows but this show was just brilliant. It had the perfect authenticity to what the Punisher is and it was told really well. Hell, I think this show is way better than Umbrella Academy, but that's just me. Sadly, you could tell it was going to end at season 2 just by seeing how Jigsaw was handled at the end...what a waste. It had so much more potential and only 2 seasons...stupid Netflix.The actors in this show are all incredible and you fall in love with all the characters. You really get to know their personas and how each character has an influence on each other. The writers, actors and everyone involved in its creation made a show that I will always remember. Jon brought the Punisher to life and I don't think there will ever be a better Punisher than him, he really owned that character. To me, he's what Ryan is to Deadpool. If there ever is a Movie, Jon just has to be the Punisher or it won't be the Punisher.\",\n",
       " 'I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until I saw Voyager accidentally one time on cable. I forgot which particular episode but it was so creative and funny, that I kicked myself for not noticing this treasure. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, I am able to embark into every episodes for the entire 7 seasons. What about the doctor!? Emergency Medical Hologram to Emergency Command Hologram, Robert Picardo made me love the show so much, what a joy to just see him perform and struggle with his \"humanity\". He makes me laugh out loud so many times, I had to apologize to my roommate for my uncontrollable outburst. Voyager is my painkiller for breaking out the laughs. It\\'s just so funny sometimes, I can\\'t help it. My wife and I love, Jeri Ryan (Seven) and Robert Picardo (EMH) duet -- \"You are my sunshine\". Their voices so pure, I still hear it in my head. It might be corny to some but Voyager is making a grand statement -- to EXPRESS as humanly possible -- the purest form of unrelentless expression of art -- without restraint -- of music, dreams and holo novels, etc. I have to say, Voyager is a very entertaining series. There are immense creativity into the moral conscience, and interpersonal development within each member of the crew. Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, writers of Voyager gave Picardo the freedom to express beyond anything you can imagined. He is more feeling and more emotional than most organics -- and boy, can he sing! I love the premise for doctor\\'s expansive, self growth, developing, and becoming a valuable member as part of \"the family\" decision in the final 2 episodes of Endgame; science fiction at its best! Toward the end, EMH actually disobey Captain\\'s order and make \"human\" mistakes. I believe the chemistry between the crew works well. Harry Kim and Tom Paris, Neelix and Tuvok <-- those two are actually quite funny. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I\\'m SO GLAD they did not go with the original actress for Janeway-- have you seen the rare 1st episode footage?! -- thank God for Kate Mulgrew! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. Let me put it this way, Kate Mulgrew did more than I ever envision a female Captain could do -- even with a hint of feminine quality. Hard to believe but the chemistry balance was just right. Kate, what a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creativity, of morals issues we face everyday, and the potential possibilities of our Cosmic expanse.',\n",
       " \"I've been a fan of the Star Trek series since Star Trek the Next Generation. I used to watch The Next Gen after school and I loved the idea of going off to space to explore new worlds and meeting new peoples. But the one thing that bothered me about the series was all the constrictions that the Enterprise had to go through. There was several shows that had the Federation saying 'You can't do this, or that!' But with Star Trek Voyager you have a smaller ship with only a couple of dozen of people on board in a distant part of the galaxy who are trying to get home. Far away from their family, friends and superiors. The series does an great job at redefining several species and introduces new ones. The cast is great and is always fun to watch Robert Picardo as the Doctor because he gets me laughing all the time. The ship has plenty of interesting characters all growing throughout the series. The Doctor becomes more then just a hologram medical helper and becomes a real member of the ship. Captain Janeway becomes a strong confident captain. Tom Paris, a womanizing troublemaker buckles down with a former hot head, federation hating Klingon. So if you love space exploration then this is the series for you.\",\n",
       " 'Voyager is the best Star Trek series yet, hands down. While that may be an opinionated statement, I reason this by pointing out several key parts of the show which make it more enjoyable than any other series. The cast, firstly, has a lot of diversity and characters such as Janeway, Seven of Nine and the Doctor are extremely engaging throughout their respective seasons. The concept of the ship being stranded thousands of light years away from Earth or Federation space is not simply an interesting basis in its own right, but betters the development of these characters. They are isolated in an unknown region of space with foreign enemies and perils, which forces the characters to grow and adapt. It creates a new level of camaraderie as the Voyager crew depend on their ingenuity, co-operation and resourcefulness to find a way home.While these new aliens and planets may seem off-putting to both newcomers and old fans of Star Trek, the show is grounded nicely by the Federation principles which Voyager upholds. Their journey home is seen also as a mission of exploration, and familiar issues- such as the classic moral dilemma or Prime Directive story- return in different circumstances. However well the writers stick to the tried and tested formula (which is not a bad thing), a whole new quadrant of the Milky Way allows plenty of scope, as mentioned, for new enemies. While the Kazon are quite possibly the least intriguing of these, the disease-decimated Vidiians, hunting driven Hirogen, unmatchable Species 8472 etc are all fascinating. Romulans, Cardassians, Ferengi etc make \"cameos\" too, while the Borg encounters have made Captain Janeway the stuff of legend.The main reason to watch Voyager is that it is enjoyable, just like most Star Trek and like all TV aims to be. It has the real feeling of exploration, revamped and revitalised from the older programmes. The real Star Trek atmosphere is caught up in the lonely but determined ship stuck in the Delta Quadrant, sticking to their guns through thick and thin.',\n",
       " 'Doom Patrol is one of the more unknown groups in the DC Roster. I mean think about it. None of them have respectable powers (except for Cyborg), they are a dysfunctional family and their villains are absurdly silly! But the way this show presents it is simply amazing.Doom Patrol falls in between shows that are simply sadistic and shows that are silly (teen dramas and stuff). It manages to never cross either line and does it perfectly well. It\\'s good weird. It can make you feel emotions and also make you laugh your ass off. Sometimes while watching, I am just thinking \"How can they pull off something so silly, so well?\". I mean this show has a queer living street called Danny, a man who can make things happen by flexing his arms, fart demons, sex demons etc.And the actors too do a tremendous job. Brendan Fraser in particular does an outstanding job as Robotman.Overall absolutely worth your time. One of the few good comic book show.',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t know the majority of these characters - only Cyborg - so had no expectations of their depictment or of the Doom Patrol as a collective. I do, though, have an expectation for DC to be darker, more grounded, their heroes to have more of an edge. This is what I heard the show was going to be, so all good!However, whilst the show is dark, humorous and edgy, it\\'s also endless introspection of pained and agonising characters endlessly being pained and agonised. Every episode is whiney and snivelling \"heroes\" constantly being \"woe is me\". It\\'s ultimately grating. It feels like being a babysitter to a bunch of 4 year olds away from their parents for the first time.And the back stories... Well, the show is one endless back story. One back story leads to the next, which delves into the back story behind the back story... 15 episodes later and there\\'s been no real story I can relate.At this moment I feel like a bad gambler chasing a losing streak. \"I\\'ve put 8 hours in, if I put the 9th hour in it\\'ll have been worth it.\" \"I\\'ve put 9 hours in now, if I put...\" \"I\\'ve put 10 in...\" Well, I\\'m up to about 15 now, not sure if I\\'ll gamble on S2 to put the 16th in.For all my own pain and being agonised, it\\'s not an awful show. If you like the Oprah shows of people emerging from childhood abuses + Twin Peaks + Remo/Doc Savage, then you\\'ll love this. Personally, love the humour of Remo/DS, the weirdness of Lynch is always appreciated (but in small doses), but I don\\'t do the endless tears and heartstrings of Oprah.It has all the correct ingredients to be a great show. It\\'s just the quantities are so far off it\\'s miss, and thus a bigger disappointment as it\\'s close.',\n",
       " \"...and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But what disappoints me here is that there were three amateur writers, with this film as their first ever writing credit (Chris Charles, Danny Kravitz and Robert Lorenz - who also directed), and I wish they'd consulted a seasoned writer - and making a point to tell that writer that Liam Neeson was the lead.For their first writing credit, it wasn't that bad, but the 108 min runtime wasn't used effectively. It either needed to be trimmed down to about 80 mins - for the current story and pacing, or (and I would've preferred this) fill those minutes with more action and suspense. And that's not even considering Neeson was cast, and we all know we crave his action. So not getting that action, was a huge let down. Even the title of this film, only fills 5 minutes of the 108, and that's pretty sad - and a waste. There were a few plot and technical issues, as well as some content that should've been omitted i.e. bank issues, especially how that bonfire was fueled (without giving away any spoilers), which in my opinion was dumb.This was also Lorenz's 2nd directing credit, and considering that, his work was impressive. The scenes were fluid, camera work on point, and it seemed the cast had great direction from him. The cinematography and score were also decent. It's a recommended watch - because of Neeson, but I wouldn't see it again, and probably forget about it down the road. It's a 7/10 from me.\",\n",
       " 'My love for Liam Neeson knows no bounds - no matter how many mediocre movies he stars in, I will always watch the next one, in hopes that maybe my expectations will be subverted and I will be treated to a good film. Unfortunately, in the last few years, Mr. Neeson has starred in a string of mediocre movies. \"Taken 3\" is bad beyond description, mainly due to its atrocious editing style. \"Cold Pursuit\" attempted to go the dark comedy route, and in my opinion, missed its mark. \"Honest Thief\" was painfully banal, filled with stilted acting and a noticeable lack of action. And now we have \"The Marksman,\" another entry in the mediocre Liam Neeson movie genre.\"The Marksman\" is less of an action thriller and more of a drama, and that\\'s not inherently bad. However, the movie boasts an astounding lack of suspense and tension throughout, plodding along from scene to scene until the inevitable final confrontation - which to the film\\'s credit, is exciting. However, before you have the pleasure of watching that, you have to sit through a long, slow, road-trip style adventure, that lacks any type of thrill. Sure, you\\'ll find one or two intermittent \"action\" scenes during the course of the movie, but these scenes barely contain any worthwhile action. There is a poorly filmed fistfight that lasts about 10 seconds, as well as a mild getaway type of scenario that our hero has to escape from, and that\\'s about it.Because of its lack of action, the main draw of \"The Marksman\" is its actors, namely Liam Neeson and Jacob Perez. Liam Neeson is good with what the script has him do, and I enjoyed his character. A previous member of the Marine Corp, Liam\\'s character, Jim, struggles with alcohol, and is unapologetically atheist, which I found interesting for a character in a mainstream film. While I was originally opposed to watching a movie with a child actor in it, because of how bad child actors usually are, Jacob Perez was, to my surprise, pretty good. He could pull off emotion when he needed to, but mostly he was likeable, and it was enjoyable to watch him and Liam interact. There was some good comedy throughout, and some interesting conversations between the two characters, but that leads me into some more negatives.Unfortunately, for a movie that is so dialogue heavy, a lot of the dialogue was very boring. There were so many opportunities for the characters to argue or engage in a verbal battle because of their own respective beliefs and morals, but the script took the easy way out it seems, instead employing a large use of exposition. Additionally, for a movie that takes place on the road, it doesn\\'t look very good. The cinematography and directing is very basic, almost as if this was originally a made for television film that at the last minute the studios decided to release in theatres.When the action starts, it is exciting, specifically the battle at the end. Liam pulls off some badass moves, and he puts his rifle to work. However, at this point the movie was too little, too late, and I was so disengaged that I was more looking forward for it to end. In case it wasn\\'t clear - I still love Liam Neeson, and I\\'ll never stop watching his movies. However, at the end of \"The Marksman,\" I almost found myself asking if I should even bother anymore.',\n",
       " 'Our late career action hero Liam Neeson is back in what Clint Eastwood have starred decades of his acting career as Jim Hanson in \"The Marksman\".Katheryn Winnick co-stars in this film directed by Robert Lorenz.In it,we get to see an Arizona border patrol member who protects a young Mexican boy who is desperately fleeing from the assassins of a cartel. As he gets to the border in Arizona,we get to see the cartel pursues the young boy as the latter gets to land in the US.The movie was definitely serviceable at best. No question that Liam Neeson delivers as Jim - the marksman - which is enough to make it entertaining. Also, we get to see him morphing into the new Clint Eastwood. Evidently, Neeson will continue to delight his movie fans (me included) with the future action thrillers that has yet to come.',\n",
       " 'Greetings again from the darkness. Liam Neeson\\'s particular set of skills, and his grumpy face, seem to show up on screen most every January. If there is a surprise to this year\\'s entry, it\\'s that the annual Liam action movie is not directed by Jaume Collet-Sera, as were THE COMMUTER (2018), RUN ALL NIGHT (2015), NON-STOP (2014), and UNKNOWN (2011). Mr. Collet-Sera has apparently traded Liam in for The Rock as his go-to action star. Instead, it\\'s director Robert Lorenz (TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE, 2012) who co-wrote the script with two other first time screenwriters, Chris Charles and Danny Kravitz. As with most (not all) of Mr. Neeson\\'s aging-action-hero films, this one is both watchable and forgettable.Jim Hanson (Neeson) is a struggling Arizona cattle rancher. He\\'s also a flag-flying former Marine, who carries a walkie-talkie so he can immediately inform the Border Patrol whenever he spots \"IAs\" (illegal aliens) crossing his land. Jim is a shell of his former self ever since his beloved wife passed away. He spread her ashes on the hill next to his rundown home ... a home that sits on land in the final stages of bank foreclosure. Her daughter Sarah (Katheryn Winnick, \"Vikings\") is part of the Border Patrol and periodically keeps tabs on Jim.Although he never seems to care much for those crossing the border, Jim\\'s quick to offer a drink to anyone stranded and injured, even as he calls the Border Patrol. A young boy and his pleading mother are no different until a carload of cartel boys show up. The subsequent shootout leaves a couple of people dead and ignites a cross-country cat-and-mouse chase. A previous scene from Mexico taught us that the mother, Rosa (Teresa Ruiz), and her son, Miguel (Jacob Perez), were sent on the run thanks to her brother\\'s crossing of the cartel. Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba, THE 33, 2015) is the intimidating cartel soldier sent to kill the mother and son.The story covers Monday through Saturday, in what would be considered a stressful week for just about anyone. Jim had promised Miquel\\'s mother that he would take the boy to her cousin\\'s home in Chicago, and being the good soldier, he is committed to fulfilling his duty. Along the way, the grizzled old man and the angry young boy bond while driving in Jim\\'s bullet-riddled pickup truck. Hot dogs and hamburgers play a role, but mostly a late confrontation in a barn attempts to add some character development to a story that, to this point, had very little.Filmmaker Lorenz has a history with Clint Eastwood, and offers up a respectful nod to his mentor by including a grainy scene from HANG \\'EM HIGH on a motel television. There is surprisingly little political commentary included, which actually adds to the slowness and dryness of the material. Liam Neeson is now 68 years old, and he has developed a nice little niche for himself with these action movies that are interesting enough to burn a couple of hours for viewers.',\n",
       " \"This is only the second film by director Robert Lorenzo. Who's he? Exactly. He is best known as an assistant director and producer of mostly Clint Eastwood films and some great ones like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. His first solo film is Trouble with the Curve where the main role is played, surprisingly, by Clint Eastwood himself. I really liked that movie. The difference between this and this film is the script, this time he wrote it himself and it is not good at all. It is often predictable, one-way, and uneven. Overall though, I can't judge the film with Liam Neeson where he plays himself badly. He will turn 69 this year, and he is still making films like this. I call this a typical Liam Neeson movie, if you've watched one in the last ten years, you've watched it all. A gloomy man with a difficult and vulnerable past who does not look for troubles but they find him, and he possesses special skills that he is forced to use. The good thing about movies like this is that you know you're going to get what you expected, and all of those movies are good or very good, they won't disappoint you. Same thing with this movie. If you're going to look for holes in the script or criticize the characters, then this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that will entertain you or take a break from your commitments for a hundred minutes, and you're a fan of Mr. Neeson like me then I can definitely recommend this movie to you.\",\n",
       " 'Other reviewers have given the makers of this screen story a bit of an undeserved caning.Is it genre-fare written to an apparent familiar formula? Yes. There is a practical limit to how many stories can be really original any more.The story backbone has been told in many forms before and being a writer, I had a fair clue how it was going to conclude. The characters were drawn well by their respective actors.Was the story well executed? Yes I think it was. It was also raised beyond slam, bamm and drink the bourbon. Any more detail and I will be publishing spoilers.Contrary to the genre, the young character wass written without smart backanswers, emotional hystrionics and generally unlikeable behaviour towards adults.The writers wisely avoided the cliche of victim aggression and acting out towards the rescuer in some sort of emotional and revelationary rehook into a new story chapter. That has been overdone so much over the years as to be maukish.The young actor gives a surprisingly restrained performance, maybe influenced by Liam Neeson or carefully directed or both.There were opportunities in the story for a director to be tempted into a few clammy cliches which were thankfully avoided.The locations were not recognisable from other movies so that was a refreshing change.With the music underscore, I was quite impressed. Part of the head and tail bookends seem to be homage to two other films from the 80s and 90s in their arrangement and tone colours. However they were entirely original and skillfully woven.The underscore through the film does not draw attention and may have been even left absent for all I know. That is when underscores work best. No musical distractions were necessary anywhere to \"save\" the film. That speaks for the work done by the writer and director more so than folk may realise.If you have the opportunity to see the film in a cinema, I recommend you do so.',\n",

       " '\"Gladiator\" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score \\x96 it is truly a \"complete\" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less \"popular\" artists who also deserve a big \"bravo\". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for \"Gladiator\" is brilliant \\x96 and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.\"Gladiator\" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven\\'t gone and watched it \\x96 I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money.

Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****.\",\n",
       " \"Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: \\x91Strength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.\\nIt is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can \\x91do evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails.\",\n",
       " \"So I watched the pilot and fell in love with the show for many different reasons; the beautiful countryside, the cleverly written mysteries, the sly Indian friend, the spunky deputy..... But above all, I fell in love with Walt Longmire played brilliantly by Robert Taylor. (Who I was slightly crushed to find out was Australian, not American.) I loved his Character, a strong, silent, funny-in-a-wry-deadpan-kind-of-way, all around good man.Then I found out that there where books, and my heart sank. No way was I not going to read them, but I was afraid that the book Walt Longmire would be different from the show Walt Longmire, who I really liked.I stand by the view that the book is always better that the movie or TV show, because let's face it, things suffer when you transfer to the screen, usually the characters. That is why when a character is done well, the success is all the sweeter.You can sacrifice a lot, in the form of story line, if the characters are acted and written well. (Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings, or Colin Firths Mr.Darcy in Pride and Prejudice) I read the books and found that I had nothing to be afraid of! If at all possible I got more excited about the show because I read the TV Walt in the pages of the book, and the book gave me more depth and back story to this man's character that I now saw played out in the show. That's how good a job Robert Taylor does.Read the books! Watch the show! And enjoy them both for that are just extensions of each other!And that is why I am a fan!\",\n",
       " \"Season 1 of Legends of Tomorrow was a mixture of tones and themes that ended with somewhat of a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. It wasn't sure where it wanted to go, it wasn't sure of what it wanted to do. It's ironic that the issues of the first season became a sort of metaphor for the show's characters: evolving beyond where they started to become something better.Made up of the secondary heroes of the Arrowverse, the show painted its characters as outcasts of that world, not good enough to headline their own show like The Flash or Supergirl. The first season labels this mentality as a bad thing. After recognizing that the tone of the show wasn't working, the writers decided to embrace that theme, but with comedy being the end result rather than melodrama.Thus was born a different show basically. Superpowers took a backseat to wacky situational comedy. Fistfights were turned into corny motivational speaks. And their characters evolved to fit this new paradigm. The strangest thing about all of it: it totally works.Legends of Tomorrow is not for everyone, as most superhero properties are. However, this show from season 2 on is definitely worth a try simply due to the fact there's nothing else like it on air right now. They're may be no other show like it period. The incredible mix of corny action, the wacky situations the Legends find themselves in, and the genuinely good development of basically every character all come together in a truly remarkable story about people changing for the better.I do believe what they say is true: heroes are in the limelight, they are the ones seen and their actions are praised. But the people you don't see are just as important. Heroes are the ones we remember, but Legends never die.\",\n",
       " 'This show is a gem.The entire show can be described as a combination of Back to the Future, Dr Who, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Supernatural rolled up into one. This show gets it a bit of a reputation as a \"black sheep\" in an era of gritty, dark, or at least just serious DC comic book shows/movies... but there\\'s just something about watching this show that gives me the same rush and excitement of watching Saturday morning cartoons as a kid.While most of DC\\'s shows are campy with low budget effects and take themselves seriously, Legends embraces ridiculousness, pokes fun at their low budget, acknowledges they are the misfits, and provides a high quality time travel show full of action and comedy.While this show does have some complaints from die hard fans of DC\\'s dark and gritty themes (Which there\\'s nothing wrong with, especially when involved with Characters like Batman), this show is easily a hook for people who prefer \"The marvel method\" of comic book cinematography.While it did take some time to get some traction with Season 1 essentially being the show\\'s \"Star wars prequels\", the following seasons are a very fun ride through history and embraces \"Screwing up history for the better\" to make a comedic show with a lot of heart.',\n",
       " \"Legends of Tomorrow used to just be silly, now it's just ridiculous. Storylines have gotten totally convoluted and make zero sense. The cast no longer feels as bloated as it once was, but now it's like they're throwing in everything but the kitchen sink just to keep making things happen. The show is riddled with gigantic plot holes and completely lazy writing. Like, what the hell is the point to having a time-traveling spaceship, when you have a bureau that can just press a button with a little device and they can just time travel that way? The whole thing seems arbitrary and pointless. And in half the episodes now the heroes never use any of their powers. Aren't they supposed to be superheroes? Episodes just keep making huge jumps in logic and expecting the viewers to just accept it. They don't provide explanations for absolutely anything. It's like the writers know that things have gotten so silly, that they just don't care anymore. Compare it to a series like Doom Patrol. That show is super silly, but at least things make sense on some level, and you know people writing for it truly care. It's like Legends just doesn't give a crap. Performances used to show promise, now they're just cringe-worthy. What happened? I'm a huge DC, sci-fi, and time travel fan, and I really can't stand the show anymore. Whatever corner they've turned, it hasn't been for the better. It's time these Legends ride off into the sunset.\",\n",

       " 'Everything I saw, read and heard about \\'Aquaman\\' before it came out had me convinced it wouldn\\'t be my cup of tea. My impression was that this would be yet another bloated studio tentpole with cheesy dialog, a generic story and artificial looking CGI. However, once it opened, a passionate film fan I respect a lot started spreading so much obviously genuine enthusiasm for the movie that I eventually got over myself and watched it.I think it was the moment when Nicole Kidman swallowed a goldfish that I started to suspect I might actually enjoy this movie. That suspicion, however, turned out to be wrong, because I didn\\'t just enjoy it: I ended up ADORING it. The weirdest thing: the film DID contain all those elements I had feared - and yet none of that seemed to matter. It just works. It shouldn\\'t, but it somehow does, which is why I\\'ve since come to the conclusion that director James Wan is some sort of genius wizard filmmaker. Don\\'t let the generic superhero tropes and cheesy dialog fool you into thinking this was a typical mainstream movie (though I DO suspect those things managed to fool the studio executives into thinking exactly that: which is probably how James Wan got away with it), because in truth, this is the least generic, most bonkers big budget studio flick I\\'ve seen in ages. It\\'s the film \\'Valerian\\' wants to be. It\\'s crazy; it\\'s over-the-top; it\\'s beautifully designed with incredible attention to every little detail in every frame; it doesn\\'t take itself seriously for a second, and yet it fully commits to - and loves - its characters and the world they inhabit.I was awed, literally awed by the design of the Atlantian society and technology; the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original - which caught me completely off guard, because I didn\\'t expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses. When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as \"Aquabro\" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginable, I had a stupid grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn\\'t let up. \\'Aquaman\\' never loses steam; there\\'s no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching \\'LOTR: The Return of the King\\' for the first time.It\\'s true, \\'Aquaman\\' delivers the typical, clichéd, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they\\'re not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film\\'s greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again, because I was so in love with its bonkers, \"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\" approach to filmmaking. Naturally, I now hope James Wan will also direct \\'Aquaman 2\\', as I\\'m sure if given the chance, next time not even the kitchen sink will be safe.P.S.

       " \"Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10\",\n",
       " \"I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5\",\n",
       " 'Here I am, thirty and something years later, watching again this classical cult TV series, now on DVD. In the 70\\'s, I felt in love for \"Star Trek\" in network television, becoming a great fan of this series. Later, with VHS and cable TV, I taped all the episodes. Along the last years, I bought some episodes on DVD, released in USA. And now, I have just bought the three seasons on Brazilian DVD.I have just finished watching the First Season, and I was amazingly excited watching again (how many times? I can not even guess\\x85) the journeys of the USS Enterprise, commanded by her powerful Captain James T.

       " \"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'.\\nThe new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure.\\nThe best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'.\\nThe writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture.\\nHowever, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material.\\nOverall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.9/10\",\n",
       " 'I honestly didn\\'t think that Spielberg had another crowd-pleasing actioner left in him. For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?This film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I\\'m still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I\\'d say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the \"real\" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That\\'s a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn\\'t even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento\\'s soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.I have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there\\'s some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out \"form of a gundam\" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn\\'t been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn\\'t. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky (\"Oh God, it\\'s f*%@ing Chucky\" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).But to say that this is nothing but leaching off others\\' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It\\'d seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn\\'t all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I\\'d call the film overly deep or anything, but it\\'s certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.The characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival\\'s shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don\\'t look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic\\'s director Sorrento is a great villain. He\\'s so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he\\'s cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom\\'s basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he\\'s in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He\\'s a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \\nAnd I really really didn\\'t think Spielberg could pull this off. It\\'s hard to\\nwrite a love letter to your favorite films when you\\'re the creator rather than consumer. I\\'d have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can\\'t recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel\\'s author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.',\n",

He has been labeled both a peddler of popcorn and a saccharine manipulator (Those who say the latter have clearly forgotten Alex Kitner erupting in a geyser of blood in Jaws, exploding Nazi heads, the horrors of the Holocaust in Schindler and the river of corpses in War of the Worlds). There are two Spielbergs. \\nThere's the man who makes somber, academy award winning dramas (Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, Munich, War Horse, Lincoln etc).

What I enjoy most about the 'Berg, is how he can zigzag between disparate genres. \\nBut after a stretch of SF films (A.I, Minority Report and War of the Worlds), I was looking forward to a return to the free wheeling fun with Crystal Skull. It turned out to be an uncharacteristic dud that despite the boffo box office, proved to be deeply unpopular with fans of the series.This made me cautious about Ready Player One.

I have not read Ernest Cline's novel, so fans of the popular novel may have issues, but I rarely read the books before seeing the film. The cast are great. Tye Sheridan are Olivia Cooke are the standouts. Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg are fun in supporting roles. Alan Silvestri's robust score is one of his most memorable. I miss John Williams, but it's still a great score. Longtime 'Berg collaborator Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is beautiful. And it's the only film where you'll see a DeLorean chasing a T-Rex on the big screen. That image alone is worth the ticket price. \\n \\nHe never went away, but it's nice to see him back playing in the sand box.\",\n",
       " \"I went to see this movie with my boyfriend. I had read the book and he hadn't. Let me start with saying to all those people who say that people who've read the books are whining that my boyfriend didn't like the movie whatsoever. Yes there are a couple of cool scenes. Yes there are some funny jokes. Yes the CGI looks amazing. But oh my lord what happened? What happened to all the smart dialogue and puzzle solving? What happened to the cool and funny references? And oh my god what happened to the plot? I'm aware that it can be difficult to transfer a book to a movie but come on. Nothing besides the characters names were similar to the book. The plot is very Hollywood and stiff. It's nothing you haven't seen before. Hollywood unfortunately got the best of this one.\",\n",
       " \"'Ready Player One (2018)' should have been called 'The Pop-Culture Movie', since it is so chock-full of blatant references and call-backs to media, from the eighties and nineties in particular. It seems as though this over-reliance on pre-existing material, along with its recognition and nostalgic value, is the driving force behind most of the narrative, being that the flick itself doesn't capture the spirit of the films it intends to ape, and so often calls out by name to cringe-worthy results, but instead shoves in reference after soulless reference in a vapid attempt to prey on its audience's ability to recognise things they've seen before. This 'nostalgia vampirism' is meant to evoke memories of better films and have those emotions transposed onto this one, though it only succeeds in the former and reminds you how much you'd rather watch any of those than this. It's evocative of the larger issues that plague the flick, those being that it doesn't have any real stakes or ability to engage on its own and also treats its audience as rather dumb and forces expository dialogue down their throats at every opportunity. The on-the-nose exposition was honesty some of the most intense and grating I'd experienced in some time. The feature did have some nice visual effects and I cared about the digital 'avatars' as much as any of their real-world counter-parts, though only to a certain degree, but so much was happening that it was hard to register at times due to the odd colour palette and heavily contrasting character designs. It didn't have a cohesive aesthetic, to say the least. It did have a good score by Alan Silvestri and some of its allegorical undertones certainly ring true. I honestly wasn't entertained, though, despite all the visual splendour and things that should appeal directly to me, and that really tells you all you need to know. For all the throw-away movie references, where was the fun of 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)'? Where was the wonder of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)', the suspense of 'Jaws (1975)' or the excitement of 'Jurassic Park (1993)'? In other words, where was Spielberg? 4/10\",\n",
       " \"If you are just looking for a fun movie with expertly directed action sequences, wow moments, and beautiful effects, this is the movie for you. If you are the type of person who cannot help but analyze every movie you see, Ready Player One will cause you some problems.  Spielberg is a master of wow moments. He knows how to capture characters in moments of awe, and he knows how to make the audiences respond with dropped jaws and bewildered expressions. That's why the guy is one of the most financially successful filmmakers of all time. Watching this particular film of his makes it easy to see, even if you weren't already aware of his reputation, that Spielberg works the camera like few others can. That said, this movie is not perfect.  The premise, at least on its surface, seems wonderful. A teenage boy (Tye Sheridan), named Wade Watts (because it sounds like a superhero's alter ego) in the near future plays an ultra-version of a virtual reality game to escape his grim real-world existence. Everyone in his world does. And we can see why. The VR world (The Oasis) is awesome.  Wade spends his time obsessing over a contest in The Oasis left behind by its now deceased creator. The winner of the contest claims a kajillion dollars (or something like that) and control over The Oasis. With a prize like that, Wade is obviously not the only person trying to win. So, one day he meets a girl who uses the player name Art3mis (a charming Olivia Cooke) and joins her group. Together they try to win the contest before the evil company does and puts ads in The Oasis (which doesn't seem that bad). Then blah, blah, blah. You can imagine how this all turns out. If not, great, you'll be surprised. This all seems fine and fun until you dissect the movie even a little bit. The message the movie sends is that this is all about friendship, which is total BS. Friendship is important, sure, but in this world, there is more at stake. Wade and much of the country live in terrible poverty, and a couple mega-businesses control the state of everything. It's a miserable reality with problems that we see today, except amplified by 100.  It's irresponsible and insulting that the movie pretends that this future world will be okay as long as The Oasis doesn't have ads. People still live in poverty. The world is still in shambles. What I'm saying is, the movie has a problem with stakes. The stakes of this future world are enormous and dire, but the movie chooses to ignore them. That doesn't sit right with me.  One other issue, and this one is minor, is that this movie seems like it's made for kids, but it makes a bunch of 80s nostalgia references. Does that make sense? I don't think today's 14-year-olds care about Duran-Duran.  Even looking past the social blinders this movie chooses to wear and the confusing nostalgia choices, the third act drags horribly. I spaced out for a good ten minutes and didn't miss a thing.  In spite of all that, this movie has moments of ecstasy. If you are going to see, and I'm not sure if you should, see it in a theater. If you can avoid analyzing the movie and simply enjoy it from a pure entertainment standpoint, you may love it.\",\n",
       " 'If you haven\\'t read the book, then this will be a nice fun film to watch with retro references, adventure, and a look at a world where everyone lives on VR.If you have read the book then prepare to be left bemused, gutted, devastated and downright disappointed at what a mess that Spielberg has made from an amazing geek fest book into a mundane movie for the masses. This movie could have been an absolute cult classic of a dystopian future with some amazing insights as to what a future society of Virtual Reality users would look like. But this movie has not only decided to skim over the details of the technology and how far integrated it is in every day life, not only forget building the characters story line and gradually introducing them, but instead has taken the basic story line, along with the characters and then a few key points, throw them in the air and where ever they land write a completely different story in between and Hollywood the hell out of it with absolutely no loyalty to the book. I can not even begin to list how much is missing that would make this film make more sense. In fact this movie should NOT even have the honour of the title Ready Player One, instead it should be called GAME OVER, it is an insult to the book in every way possible.If you are thinking of watching this movie and not read the book, then do as it is probably not a bad film but make sure you read the book after the movie and not before. If you have already read the book, and loved the book then I would not recommend going to see this as it will just infuriate and give you high blood pressure. Instead wait for the dvd so you can rant, shout and tut loudly at the screen without disturbing others.Sorry to repeat myself but this film is not \"Based on the book\" instead it is \"Very Vaguely Inspired by the book\"',\n",
       " 'Do you like the 80\\'s? Do you like video games? Do you like being pandered to until you want to vomit? Well this would be the movie for you. This movie is less of a movie and more of review of all pop culture of the last three decades. One of the most blaring issues is the onslaught of huge plot holes that are never addressed to any extent. For example, despite the fact that this virtual environment has people playing from all over the world, it just so happens that all prominent characters are located in the same area. It also just so happens that, despite the characters not knowing the other players past their online avatars, immediately recognize each other in the real world. Trust me when I say there are much larger more absurd examples but they contain spoilers so I will refrain from mentioning them. Speaking of characters, the development of each one is a two dimensional paper cutout that does not go beyond \"The protagonist is good\", \"The bad man is bad\", and \"The girl is a girl\". There is no example of any earnest emotion a character displays or lasting impact that a character must persevere through, even when life altering events occur. This movie focuses more on throwing as many pop culture references on screen as it can than it does on presenting the plot effectively or developing any of its characters. I am disappoint.',\n",
       " 'Ernest Cline\\'s fast-moving novel was a treasure trove for pop-culture junkies, but the endless references work better on the screen.The year is 2045; the place is Columbus, Ohio. Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, \"the stacks,\" where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade\\'s world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.The book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80\\'s pop culture references but the film doesn\\'t do that. . Spielberg doesn\\'t have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn\\'t spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who\\'ve never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren\\'t vibing on the connection, the car doesn\\'t need explaining. It\\'s just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That\\'s why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.The thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They\\'re all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. The story\\'s breakneck speed, it\\'s never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.',\n",
       " 'Of all the Spielberg films of recent years - and possibly with the exception of \"The BFG\" - this was the film whose trailer disconcerted me the most. It really looked dire: CGI over heart; gimmicks over substance. I was right about \\'The BFG\", one of my least favourite Spielberg flicks. I was definitely wrong about \"Ready Player One\": it\\'s a blast.The film is fun in continually throwing surprises at you, including those actors not included in the trailer and only on small print on the poster. So I won\\'t spoil that here for you (you can of course look them up on imdb if you want to: but I suggest you try to see this one \\'cold\\'). It\\'s 2044, and the majority of the population have taken the next logical step of video gaming and virtual reality and retreated into their own headsets, living out their lives primarily as avatars within the fanciful landscapes of \"The Oasis\". You can \"be\" anyone and (subject to gaining the necessary credits) \"do\" anything there.The Oasis was the brainchild of a (Steve Wozniak-like) genius called James Halliday (played in enormous style by \"Actor R\") and supported by his (Steve Jobs-like) business partner Ogden Morrow (\"Actor P\"). The two had a big falling out leaving Halliday in total control of the Oasis. But he died, and his dying \"game\" was to devise a devious competition that left a trail of three virtual keys in the Oasis leading to an \\'easter egg\\': which if found would provide the finder with total ownership of the Oasis and the trillions of dollars that it is worth. But the game is not only played by amateur \"gunters\" (egg-hunters) like our hero Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan, \"X-Men: Apocalypse\") and his in-Oasis flirting partner Samantha (Olivia Cooke, \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\"); there are big corporate game-hunters involved like IoI (that\\'s eye-oh-eye, not one-oh-one as I assumed from the trailer) who fill warehouses with combinations of nerd-consultants and professional game players to try to find the keys before anyone else. Which hardly seems fair does it? Ruthless boss Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn, \"Rogue One\") and his tough-as-nails hench-woman F\\'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen, \"Tomb Raider\") really couldn\\'t give a toss!What follows is two-hours of high-octane game-play and eye-popping 3D (it is good in 3D by the way) that melds a baseline of \"Avatar\" with soupçons of \"Tron\", \"Minority Report\" and Dan Brown novels. But its a blend that works.I was afraid as I said that CGI would squash flat any hope of character development and story, and - yes - to be sure this is \\'suppressed\\' a bit. You never get to really know many of the \\'pack\\' members to any great level other than Wade and Samantha. And exactly what drives the corporate protagonists, other than \"corporate greed\", is not particularly clear. What gives the film heart though are the performances of \"Actor P\" and (particularly) \"Actor R\", who again steals every scene he is in. For their limited screen time together, the pair bounce off each other in a delightful way.I have to make a confession at this point that I spent the whole film thinking \"Miles Teller is way too old for the part of Wade\"! Tye Sheridan (who I think *does* bear a likeness!) is actually much more age appropriate, and is fine in the role. But the star performance for me, out of the youngsters at least, was Oldham\\'s-own Olivia Cooke, who has a genuinely magnetic screen presence. She is most definitely a name to watch for the future. Almost unrecognizable in the role is the woman of the hour Letitia Wright (\"Black Panther\", \"Thor: Ragnarok\") as Wade\\'s inventor friend Reb.The story, although simple and quite one-dimensional, in the main intrigues: there is nothing like a Mario-style chase for keys to entertain when it is done well (I am so old and crusty that in my day it was \"Manic Miner\" on a ZX-Spectrum!).And there\\'s not just one \"Easter Egg\" in this film: the film is rammed to the rafters with throwbacks to classic pop-culture icons of past decades, and particularly the 80\\'s.... the film could have been subtitled \"I Heart 80\\'s\". Some of these are subliminal (Mayor Goldie Wilson anyone?), and others are more prominent but very clever: \"The Zemekis cube\" and \"The Holy Hand Grenade\" being prime examples. This is a film that deserves buying on Blu-ray and then slo-mo-ing through! The nostalgia extends to the music by Alan Silvestri, with occasional motifs from his most famous soundtrack! For me though, the highspot of the film though is a journey into a recreation of a classic \\'80\\'s film which - while a scary sequence, earning for sure its 12A UK rating - is done with verve and chutzpah. Although a little overlong (2 hours 20 mins) and getting rather over-blown and LOTR-esque in the finale, the ending is very satisfying - roll on Tuesdays and Thursdays! Spielberg\\'s recent films have been largely solid and well-constructed watches (\"The Post\" and \"Bridge of Spies\" for example) but they have been more niche than mainstream box office draws. I firmly predict that \"Ready Player One\" will change that: here Spielberg has a sure-fire hit on his hands and word of mouth (rather than the ho-hum trailer) should assure that.(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann\\'s Movies on Facebook. Thanks).',\n",
       " \"Its hard for me to believe all of the one and two star reviews for this film on here from people who are obsessed with the book. In fact, I even heard similar comments from people in the theater after the movie ended. One girl was actually complaining that she disliked it for the same reason she can't watch Game of Thrones, because it's not faithful to the source material.Well I'm sorry that your trip out of your parent's basement wasn't as satisfying as you hoped, but for the rest of us who haven't read the book and are not obsessive video game or pop culture fans it was a great movie. There's enough references for everyone to enjoy the story, but not enough to confuse the majority of the audience.The visual effects are stunning and while the story may be wrapped up a little too neatly, its still a stunning tour de force from the best director in the business. This was a great film with an excellent warning about the overuse video games and virtual reality. Definitely one to see and if you want more, than go read the book.\",\n",
       " \"In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.Liberally adapting portions of Thor comic book lore to fit in a more modern comic book film reality, Thor introduces us to a centuries old war between the Asgardians, beings that live for long periods of time and can travel through space from their home realm of Asgard to various other worlds, such as Earth, via the Bi-Frost bridge, and the conflict centric Frost Giants, whom the Asgardians conquered some time back. Odin (Anthony Hopkins), ruler of the Asgardians, is preparing to abdicate his throne to his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), but on the eve of Thor's inauguration, agents of the Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and attempt to steal back a device that is the key to their power, which had been taken by Odin at the end of their long struggle. When Thor disagrees with his father's desire to not to retaliate in order to not disturb the peace that currently exists between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants, he takes matters into his own hands, traveling to the Frost Giant's realm with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and compatriots Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Fandral (Josh Dallas) in tow. When the encounter with the Frost Giants ends with tensions re-ignited between the two factions, Odin decides that his son is not prepared to lead his people, and exiles Thor, sans his powers, to Earth.When he arrives on Earth, he is discovered by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who are convinced that he isn't a random homeless vagabond that they found in the middle of the desert. Thor must attempt to locate his power hammer, Mjolnir, from the government agents that have captured it, and attempt to reclaim his place in Asgard. However, he finds that, without his super-human abilities, and surrounded by humans, perhaps some of his previous attitudes were incorrect, especially when he connects romantically with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki, who turns out to have some ulterior motives, seizes control of Asgard following the collapse of Odin from strain, and begins to hatch a grand scheme involving the Frost Giants.Thor, much like Iron Man before it, proves that, in the right hands, a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure, Thor has elements that, on the face of it, may lead a bit to some audience snickers (Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times), but the creatives behind Thor, including director Kenneth Branagh, manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy, pathos, selflessness and, perhaps even more surprisingly, involving character development. Thor is more about the lead characters at its core, again akin to Iron Man, than some other comic book films and this draws the audience into its tale.When it was first announced that Kenneth Branagh would be taking the reins of Thor as a director, it seemed something of an unusual fit for someone best known for his cinematic adaptations of the works of Shakespeare, but the final results of Thor bare out that Branagh was just the right man for the job. Considering the larger-than-life origins of the Thor comic, involving beings with the power and appearance of Gods and the various machinations of their story, the material fits fairly well with Branagh's body of work to a great extent. Especially strong is the development of Loki, who proves to be less of a traditional mustache twirling villain, and more of a misguided soul, trapped between revelations he makes about himself and his past and his respect in his father, making him more of a tragic figure than a black and white comic book antagonist.Thor benefits from strong acting from its leads, Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Hemsworth embodies Thor, first as the brash, acting-before- thinking hero, and later as a man faced with the reality that some of his choices and attitudes were not becoming of a king. Hemsworth really makes you empathize with Thor, and gives you a reason to root for the character throughout the film. Hiddleston, working with the somewhat subdued (at first) Loki eventually transforms him from a seeming weak, malleable person into one who's penchant for vengeance and control is revealed in layers, peeling back one by one through the development of the narrative.Thor isn't without its weak points, however. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster is practically and afterthought, rushed into the narrative at light speed and then not given any room to breathe or develop, it plays more as a requirement of adapting the comic story than something that works organically in the film. Portman is fine in the role, but the screenplay doesn't give enough to this relationship for it to be more than a bump in the road of the film's story.Once again, Marvel has managed to take one of their lesser known heroes and make them the subject of an entertaining film version, with energy and depth that is a bit unexpected. May they keep on making comic book films of this caliber.\",\n",
       " \"Thor was much much better than I expected. I didn't know if they could pull of the balance between the Norse mythology stuff and the real world Marvel Universe. I should've known better because Marvel knows their characters and knows what we want to see. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre back in the day. Iron Man upped the ante. Thor takes the ball and runs with it and places that bar even higher. I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.Chris Hemsworth as the Norse god Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as his villainous brother Loki show they have the acting ability and star quality to become mega-marquee names in the future. Marvel found two absolute diamonds in the rough. Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen. I know the script is written mostly for them but they carry it in a big way. From what I've read, Hemsworth and Hiddleston were cast almost a year in advance of filming the story so, they had time to get into shape and do character research. They certain did these long-time Marvel greats proud. Intelligent comic-book popcorn epics are rare and this one is definitely a cut above the usual fare.\",\n",
       " 'This is a throw-off piece of Marvel fiction that is packed full of cliché and predictability...to a point.I found myself cringing at a lot of the scenes of heroism and there\\'s a definite stink of pure cheetos-stained fanboyism in many of the scenes in general, with the usual over-the-top \"glory\" of this old four-color trope.But certain things caught my attention as well-done.First, Asgard is absolutely beautiful. They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard, the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular, the rainbow bridge, the weaponry, and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.Second, Branagh\\'s touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority. Hopkins does well with that balance, even through some cheesy scripting.And the brothers... the sibling rivalry here is very very potent in that it is nuanced and fully realized by both actors. There is love there, but also a lack of understanding, envy, and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain, in that we see, all in one package - a fighter who protects his allies, an honest counselor, a liar, a cautious thinker, a smooth tongue, and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father, but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it\\'s all very real and very stirring. And even when it\\'s clear that he\\'s done very grim deeds, you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.I was pretty surprised how moving this all was, especially when put in the middle of some otherwise-uninspiring hero pablem.So in summary, this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well, and forget the whole comic-book hero thing, since that\\'s been done far better.Thanks for reading.',\n",
       " \"Okay, so Thor is pretty darn decent. Phew. Without revealing anything regarding the plot, I'll just say that I enjoyed this film quite a lot, and would rate it above both Iron Man films, but not by too much. (If you hated them maybe just stay away from Marvel movies in general?) Very good in all areas, without achieving greatness in any sums up this movie nicely I think. Beautiful costumes and set design, solid acting all around, and much better action than recent movies have offered up. The world of Asgard has been handled wonderfully, looking absolutely gorgeous, and with all of its denizens very well spoken without their dialogue ever being as obtuse or clunky as Thor's 'Ye Olde' English has been known to be in the past. Special mention to Idris Elba for being friggin' awesome. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, but not knowing what Mjolnir is won't harm your enjoyment of Thor to any great degree I don't think. Also, side note, I personally dislike 3D with a great, burning passion (thank you Clash of the Titans), but it is relatively well done here, never distracting from the film. I would still recommend seeing it in 2D if you can though, as it is quite dark in parts. Several parts. Bring on the Avengers!\",\n",
       " 'Alright, back when this was into preproduction, I (and so many comic book fans) were surprised when Branagh was slated to direct. Here we have Thor the god of lightning and his mighty hammer, directed by a man who works mostly around William Shakespeare plays.Thankfully, this helps. A lot.Almost every superhero movie (Marvel, lately) focuses on more action instead of character development. Sure, they may look awesome, but you get used to it. Branagh bravely steers away from this predicament and directs the actors with such skill and flair you may mistake this film for yet another Branagh/Shakespeare costume epic.Make no mistake this is still a superhero film, with some nice special effects and a stylish production design for Asgard, but there\\'s a nice human twist to the story - that of dueling brothers, or gods, or god- brothers... you get the idea. Chris Hemsworth looks just about right for the part and shows some charisma as well as the hero. Branagh has assembled an interesting mix of actors - we have the great Anthony Hopkins, the cute Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba and even Rene Russo. Tom Hiddleston however steals the scene as the mischievous brother Loki.Here\\'s another good thing about the movie - the story and acting outweigh the special effects and action sequences. For a superhero film, this is extremely rare. Branagh deserves kudos for the effort, however some parts do not gel in nicely and there\\'s some action bits that are not too well-filmed.All is forgiven though - \"Thor\" is an above-average superhero movie, not extremely exciting, but definitely intriguing. Fans of both comic book films and costume dramas will certainly enjoy this.Two words of caution - one, keep an eye out for some cameos, both during and after the film. Two, for goodness sake do not watch it in 3D. I saw it in normal 2D and that\\'s fine enough by me. I didn\\'t see anything worth watching in 3D in it.Overall rating: 68/100',\n",
       " \"Plain and simple - when the humans show up the movie dies a slow death.It's a superhero movie so you know what the plot is. Hero comes to Earth to help humans. They're basically riffing Superman to the Nth degree here. But on to the important stuff...What the heck is Natalie Portman doing in this movie. I mean that in two ways. First why is she even in the movie? Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines? It felt like all of her scenes were filmed in one day and she looks so bored in all of them. Chris Hemsworth was fine as Thor and Hopkins played a good Odin, but it was the human characters that kill this one.At least Branagh threw in Skarsgard for the Swede inside joke. But as usual Stellan Skarsgard is totally wasted. After Insomnia I was just in awe of what the man is truly capable of and here in the states they always use him as a window curtain.I didn't mind the first act all that much, but for a movie about the GOD OF THUNDER, it comes off surprisingly meek.\",\n",
       " \"The Marvel magic continues with Thor, as they create yet another throrouly enjoyable, fun, action packed and humourous adventure, where we're introduced to a bigger universe extending far beyond Earths realm.What this movie does perfectly is ground the characters, and link them to our reality so that even though we're dealing with the mystical Frost Giants or the humoungous Destroyer, the characters do not appear other worldly or over powered to the existing superheroes.The visuals are captivating, whether it be the splendours of Asgard or the chilly Jotunheim, the CGI is excellent. The story is crisply told, fast paced and simple, taking us across the realms and giving us a background to some really interesting, well written and well portrayed characters.Chris Hemsworth nails the role of Thor with this charm, comic timing and of course good looks. He brings across the carefree, impulsive Thor while also showing a compassionate, gentle side to the character who'd otherwise have been all brawn and no brain.Antony Hopkins is brilliant as ever, playing Odin Allfather with all the gravitas that the ruler of the nine realms should possess. He shows his steely, ruthless side, as well as his soft, wise nature with elan.With Tom Hiddleston Marvel have struck gold when it comes to antagonist. His portrayal of Loki is by far the best negative character in the Marvel universe thus far. The God of mischief oozes charisma and brings out his underlying conflicts to perfection.Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard play important roles in helping Thor in his transformational journey, and we get small bits and pieces of Idris Elba and Jeremy Renners Heimdall and Hawkeye with a hope that they'd play meatier parts in future movies.The action sequences are frequent and fun, there's a lot of humour, especially as Thor adjusts to the ways of the Earth and it keeps you engaged from the start to the end.All in all, this film provides a perfect introduction to other worldly elements to be incorporated later in the MCU while managing to hold its own as a spectacle.It may not be on par with Iron Man when it comes to a deep, rich story line, but it's the closest a movie in the MCU has come so far in touching those grand heights.\",\n",
       " \"This film was one of the most tedious experiences of my life. I enjoy a good cheesy action film like the next guy and was genuinely looking forward to a mindless 90 minutes of fun. What I actually experienced was self important, overly buff, lord of the rings reject extras spouting some of the worst lines in film history. How Natalie Portman, let alone Stellen Skarsgard, got roped into this I will never know. Repetitive actions scenes, awful editing that cut the middle of conversations and light humour from Thors friends (puke) and the terrible Kat Dennings made for a challenging viewing experience all round. Where Iron Man went so right with its self depricating humour and quick wit Thor has languid scenes, flacid romance and wooden character interaction.The picture lacks a decent development of storyline and character which is always difficult when introducing a character with a deep backstory but it has been done so well recently with Batman Begins et al. There is a definite smell of studio meddling in the final cut with some scenes jumping all over the place. Loki (Tom Hiddleson) changes from loyal brother/Son to evil traitor with no story or character development. Anthony Hopkins spends most of the film in a coma. Chris Hemsworth can't be to blame for a film which seems over produced, over edited and that was marketed as Return of the King but was more Masters of the Universe. The decision to assign 'Ice Giants' (yes Ice Giants) as 'baddies' falls flat as they are about as scary and menacing as frosty the snowman.The whole project felt a thin and is so poorly put together you could see it unravel before your eyes. Fingers crossed for a better Summer Blockbuster in the near future...\",\n",
       " 'Hmmm, Thor\\x85 where do I begin? I have long since given up the erroneous notion that superhero movies should be true to its comic book counterparts. I also have lived long enough to see superhero titles rebooted so often that they bear no r...resemblance to their origins as told in my youth (Jane Foster is an astrophysicist stormchaser?) So, I entered Thor with absolutely no expectations. Good thing, too, because if I had any, they wouldn\\'t have been met. First, I must agree with Sir Anthony Hopkins and state that there is far to much CGI in this film and not enough character development. There were opportunities to delve into characters and their back stories that were simply ignored.Other problems include: Fight scenes that played out like video game ads, with actors trying to strike the right \"badass\" pose for the cool action shots. Annoyingly silly humor that wore thin quickly. Conflicts that were one-dimensional and built no real suspense. A forced love story. And I understand that even a god of thunder must have a character arc, and Thor\\'s was a common one that I could have overlooked\\x85 had it been better acted, and yes, better directed.The whole movie lacked gravitas. Plain and simple.There are some that have said it\\'s nothing more than a two-hour preview for the upcoming Avengers movie and I can\\'t totally disagree with that. But it is not the worst superhero movie ever made (far from it), it is simply the weakest Avengers prequel movie made to date (and yes, I\\'m including Iron Man 2 in that category).Who knows? Check your brain at the door and you might just enjoy this special episode of \"Donald\\'s Creek.\"',\n",
       " \"X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place  about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start  to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of  things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the  good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these  movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really  emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the  film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside  Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger  X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver  has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is  handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is  terrific, but the second half brings it down.  Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and  others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and  I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse  Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant  compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain  who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are  thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems  uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses  the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants  were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire  sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the  cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do  much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could  have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final  battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem  is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming  apart, making it hard to care about the situation.   Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and  Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and  Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing  for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just  brings the film down from the really good first half.  X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-.\",\n",
       " \"I loved all the X-Men movies, including X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I was so hyped when I heard they were creating an X-Men movie with Apocalypse in it. I have always loved superhero movies about the end of days. I will say specific parts that I loved and thought about this film and how I would recommend it.How good is this movie? It may not top the previous X-Men movies but that doesn't mean the movie is terrible. It is all based on opinion. Don't be scared to see the movie all because critics are making this movie look bad, go see it for yourself for your own opinion. You decide whether the movie is good or not. In my opinion, it is actually good. Not great, but good.Are the younger versions of the X-Men in this film? Yes. We have a younger version of Cyclops, Jean, Nightcrawler and Storm. We also have many amazing recurring members from the previous movies such as the young Professor X who was amazing, a slight older Magneto, Mystique who is also a little older and Beast who is still young as ever. And yes, Quicksilver returns and tops his amazing scene from X-Men: Days of Future's Past. How is Apocalypse the character? Honestly, I feel that Apocalypse was a little weaker than his comic version. If he was CGI like Thanos from Guardians of the Galaxy, he would've looked more threatening and tyrannical. I could basically compare this Apocalypse to a wimp who cosplays as Apocalypse with really good make up. His role is almost similar to Ultron.Is Wolverine in this? Yes! He may have a small cameo but it is a damn excellent cameo! When Wolverine enters the screen, the film basically transforms into an R-Rated action scene. Now that is who Wolverine is. It is also based on the real weapon x origin of Wolverine. He acts like a wild animal and slashes anyone who gets in his way and even this guy who begged Wolverine for mercy got his face ripped off! How dark is this film? It is actually pretty dark. There is a lot of death and depressing moments you will feel. We also get more connected with Magneto and why he hates humanity so much. It almost felt as he was the main antagonist in this film. We see his past and his present and why he turned into a dark and yet powerful supervillain. Also, the way Apocalypse murders people is pretty brutal and frightening.Would you recommend it? Of course! Like I said, it may not top the previous X-Men films but that doesn't mean it is terrible. If you love X-Men, as well as apocalyptic superhero movies, then this is the film for you. Go see it!\",\n",
       " \"This is not going to be a long review, i want to summarize my thoughts on the film, now after i just saw it in the cinema.The movie is absolutely spectacular. The effects, the settings, the pacing, the acting, the music, the direction. It is all very well done, and if the story itself had kept up with the rest, this would be close to one of the best, if not the best, superhero film to date.But the story is a bit weak, it's hard to take in a few of the twists and turns in this film, but still everything else is so brilliantly crafted, the movie pulls it off anyways, and that makes me feel i got my moneys worth. This is very important to me when i go the cinema. I need to walk out feeling i was entertained.I'm usually the guy that puts story and script first when it comes to films. Way to often when the story is bad, the script and the acting and all the rest that follows almost always seem half done. This is not the case here.This movie is like when you bake a cake, and you end up putting in a small amount of salt instead of sugar. You notice you did, but you don't have time to fix your mistake, so you bake the cake to the best of your abilities anyways. At the end it's one hell of a spectacular looking cake you made, but people notice the taste is a bit off, but somehow the added salt contributed to the flavor in a good way, and the cake was very much edible.This is how i feel after seeing this film. It is really well crafted, and i do recommend people seeing it.\",\n",
       " \"As you can probably gather I thought this was another very good addition to the X-Men franchise. Whilst it doesn't hit the heady heights of Days of Future Past it still is a really good watch and I fail to see why it has had a mixed press.Firstly I found it to have a perfectly serviceable story, with Apocalypse and his followers recruiting the very vulnerable and angry Magneto as part of his plan to destroy civilisation and rebuild it in his image. Fassbender turns in another solid performance and you really feel his pain and confusion for the Erik/Magneto character. I also thought all the supporting cast were absolutely fine in their roles, and to me Evan Peters as Quicksilver really stole the scenes he was in and makes a fine addition to the cast. The same also goes to Tye Sheridan as Scott/Cyclops, whose back story is filled in better and with more depth than it was in the Wolverine origins film.I see the critics have been moaning about having too many characters in the film, yet I actually think it was handled better than it was in the Captain America: Civil War film. In Apocalypse the large cast do actually have something to do and contribute to the story, whereas the Captain America film felt like some were shoe horned in, which I felt made that film feel bloated and repetitive whereas this one at least get the storyline moving. I felt that Civil War felt way too long because of all the story padding yet Apocalypse, whilst also a long film, kept my interest to the end (and yes there is a post credits scene that I suspect is setting up Wolverine 3). I should also add that Apocalypse, despite it's bleak story, does have some moments of humour and wit that went down well with the audience.I also felt the surprise appearance of Wolverine fitted in nicely with the back story that we already know, particularly the one told in X Men 2 and the Origins film, nicely closing that particular characters story arc and fitting in perfectly with the circumstances surrounding his appearance in the very first X-Men film of 16 years ago. If this is to be Wolverines final appearance with the X-men then they have given him a lovely send off.I did find some minor flaws with the film though, particularly with the visual appearance of some of the characters and how their ages don't compute when the first X-men film of 2000 is taken into account. However, asides from that I thoroughly enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse and thought it was a solid & worthy addition to the other X-Men films. The films had spectacle, action, laughs and carried on with the journeys of the characters we have got to know and love over the past sixteen years.\",\n",
       " \"I am horrified by the people on the message boards here on this movie's threads. They're fighting each other like a bunch of hungry animals. Since when does everyone started listening to the critics? I mean, yes, to have an idea before watching a movie is good, but that's not the case these days. Critics are taking movies way too seriously these days. It's just a source of entertainment. Your life does not depend on it. Stop bad mouthing this movie for others. Okay, sorry for my rant but this has gotten out of control. Now getting back to the movie, let's just say it delivered what it promised. This movie was amazing. It really felt like you were watching something Apocalyptic. Although I don't have had a problem with Bryan Singer's X Men movies, unlike a bunch of whiny babies, this one actually felt like it was an X Men movie. A sheer resemblance of what we saw in X Men cartoons, both evolution and the 1990 ones. We actually saw the main characters of this movie in their mutant form. I have loved how Bryan always preferred acting over action in his other movies, but this one, it consists of both. I have also seen critics saying that this movie is complete CGI. Well it's not like you can do actual Apocalyptic level scenes without having any CGI effects. That's just crazy. And the CGI in this movie is beyond awesome. I already smell an Oscar for CGI for this movie. Oscar Isaac was so impressive in this movie. Even though he was buried under make up and what not, you could actually feel his performance. Michael and James once again give awesome performances. Expected nothing less from Jennifer Lawrence. At least these movies actually give spotlight to the female actresses *cough* *Marvel* *cough*. The new actors were great. So talented. Tye, Sophie, Alexandra, Kodi and of course Evan Peters were all good in their respective roles. This movie might feel a different because of it's whole world at stake thing. This is the first time X Men has done this, and they succeed really good at it. It had a perfect balance of action, humor, emotion and mutants. It was like watching a live action version of those X Men cartoons we grew up watching. Once again, please dear my friends, who would love to see these guys in MCU, it's not happening anytime soon. Let's just get over it, okay? The producer of these movies has already announced a bunch of new movies under Fox. There are X Men TV shows coming out soon, so let us enjoy these while you guys enjoy yours okay?\",\n",
       " \"Overall movie was great Although movie starts a bit slow and i was a little confused and bored but after that the movie finally starts catching up to the expectation.For me this was the best x-men movie because this movie has the best action sequences as compared to any other x-men movie with a great story and emotion(not as good as days of future past but who cares its a superhero movie) .and QUICKSILVER WASSS AWESOMEEEEE .I can literally watch the movie again just because of quicksilver.I never thought they could top the X-Men: Days of Future Past action(or comedy) scene but they did.Acting of all the cast members were awesome and James McAvoy,Michael Fassbender & Jennifer Lawrence knocked it out the park.I don't understand the critics , I never did.(sound's similar to superman's mom in BvS that was in the trailer :P)Movie the great and I can't wait to watch it again.\",\n",
       " \"En Sabah Nur is Apocalypse, the first mutant who ruled ancient Egypt until he was entombed. It's the 80's. CIA agent Moira MacTaggert goes to Egypt and witnesses his emergence. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power. Meanwhile, Raven recruits Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler from an East Berlin fight club. Alex Summers brings his younger brother Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's school. Quicksilver arrives at the school just in time to rescue almost everybody from an explosion but Professor X is kidnapped by Apocalypse.I really like the first half. There are some good introduction of the new characters. It's working fine for the most part. It hits the pinnacle with Quicksilver's rescue which is funny and exciting. It is visually dynamic and a joy to behold. The rest of the movie feels like a long slow slide into mediocrity.The most troubling problem for the continuing franchise is the use of Mystique as the leading X-Men. That character has never been in that role. JLaw is struggling to put out the intensity to match the central part. She and her character is not up to the task so far. It's also funny that her powers is to not be JLaw. The other problem is Apocalypse. I hoped for better but his mega-destruction is underwhelming. It's a lot of bland and his powers are nebulous. I actually think it would have been better to allow Apocalypse to be a two-parter. As an one-and-done villain, he isn't allowed to be anything more than a monster of the moment. With a lower level of power from him, it could be more compelling to struggle for the soul of each horseman. As it stands, the character Apocalypse is nothing special.\",\n",
       " \"X-Men: Apocalypse is absolutely amazing! The early reviewers don't seem to understand these characters and they don't understand this film. It sets a new precedent for comic book films in a world over-saturated with adaptations.The film hits every nostalgic and aesthetic beat it's supposed to without devolving into pure fan service. The writing is great. The allegory the mutant plight is for civil rights is given its due screen time. The characterization of the superheroes goes beyond their powers and outfits and at least touches the heart of who they are as people. Its main fault is juggling so many characters and so some of the acting comes off as stilted at times. In a way this is also its strength, because it manages to tell a coherent and compelling narrative with a large ensemble cast of characters, emulating the source material faithfully. It is a comic book fan's film.The action scenes are epic in scope, with stakes so high you'll be on the edge of your seat with you eyes transfixed on the action, yet never does the pacing sacrifice plot or character development for obligatory spectacle. Everything is purposefully sensational.As someone who was born in the 80s and experienced these characters' evolution through popular culture onto the big screen, I can say that X-Men: Apocalypse brings the flavor of the comics and the 90s TV show to the big screen in a way that children of the 80s and 90s love.\",\n",
       " \"The first X-Men trilogy was weirdly obsessed with Wolverine, and by extension Rouge. I never understood why... This new trilogy is obsessed with Mystique just because America's sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence is portraying her. I don't mind it, but Mystique is no hero, she is a devious villain! And Beast should be well a Beast, but a handsome Nicholas Hoult is better to look at I presume. Storm is not a villain, she is a beloved X-Men character that has never been done justice. These are things that enrage fans over and over again.It is not about being a purist, but about honoring the original. In an age where superheros are invading our cinemas, one could do worse if one watches a film about hope and freedom, about homophobia, racism, bigotry, immigration and all sort of other social issues. And somehow none of the X-men films so far have successfully brought these themes to the screen.This film suffers from having to focus on thousands of characters and locations. Some characters like Mystique and Magneto are given substantial screen time, while others such as Psylocke are given only a few scenes. The film also tries to fit into the overall X-Men continuity, while trying to stand up on its own.A great film for a pop-corn viewing with your friends, but a sub-par X-Men film in general... It is sad that the most substantial superheroes of our age, that really have something to say about the world we live in, are treated as badly as this...Mutant and proud? Unfortunately there is nothing to be proud of except the money the film is about to make.\",\n",
       " \"The movie gave everything I expected from it, and more.Action? Check.Drama? Check.Funny moments and scenes? HUGE check. (still laughing when replying in my mind! :))Unlike many who watched the pre-premiere, I'm not a groupie of the X-men series, but still enjoyed each and every minute.Reading other reviews, looks like it's a good thing I'm not a groupie, because that means I don't have to stop and think about every action in the movie. I could just sit back, watch with clear mind, and enjoy.All in all, just fun to watch. 140 minutes that end with a desire for 140 more.\",\n",
       " \"I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/\",\n",
       " \"I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. Days Of Future Past is the best X-men movie so far for two main reasons:Fans of the original trilogy and First Class will definitely enjoy this one thanking its nostalgia and its perfect and well balanced mix between the original characters and the new ones (with just a few ones who maybe deserved more credit, but is not at all a problem for the movie). & This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations mixed with terrific special effects and cinematography. 3-D is very cool here.The actors are fantastic. Fassbender and McAvoy still delivering amazing performances meanwhile Stewart and Mckellen give their reflections in the same excellent way that in the trilogy. Hugh Jackman finally finds his character as a true important one in comparison with the last movies. Wolverine/Logan finally has a proper treatment in this movie that will help anyone who could be annoyed with his solo adventures to love him again. They are the five main stars of the story with the inclusion of a spectacular and skillful Mystique (impressive Jennifer Lawrence who steals almost every scene of hers) who is undoubtedly the sixth one. The other actors made good performances and make possible the transitions of the story until the amazing finale.It has been so many comparisons with The Avengers. Let me tell you something with all my respect. I found this one truly better. X-Men: Days of Future Past will please the fans and moviegoers and will inject fresh blood and joy to the franchise. This is a terrific time at the movies. Don't miss the opportunity to see it.\",\n",
       " \"As a well known director one says, to make a great movie, you have to (as a director) believe your movie is the best ever made. In today's blockbuster standards, we do not see that at all. What I see when I watch a Marvel/Disney movie (just for the example), I feel as a spectator that directors want to make an entertainment movie, with an absolutely needs of huge action and explosion scenes, with a crescendo structure ending with a KABOOM (what an illustration^^). That's great, that make good blockbusters – but not great. I had high expectations with this movie, and yet I am not an X-Men fan and Bryan singer disappointed me a lot of times - but the trailer gave me chills and as French, I really wanted to see Omar Sy in a super-production (stupid but true). Anyway, after seeing it, with 2500 X-Men fan in Paris, I was divided. In fact, I expected something else entirely. There is some plot holes, monotonous parts\\x85 However, after thought a lot about it, I have to say that is a masterpiece in super heroes' movies. Why? Because it is very different from what we see today, we are not waiting for a finale with explosions, characters just keep moving so the finale do not overdo it but is still very impressive visually. Plus, this movie is very human paradoxically: it speaks about usual mutants themes, but the very point of the movie is can we change, whether it be the past or our vision of the present. The intelligence of the movie is not to focus on changing the past but on writing the present. But the most important thing that makes this movie great is that Bryan Singer loves this franchise and more than making a great blockbuster, he wanted to make a great movie relying on the characters. He was convinced of making the best movie ever and even if it is not the case, I felt it, so despite all is defaults, X-MEN DAYS OF THE FUTURE PAST is a great movie, maybe, one of the best super-hero movies ever made. I advise you to stay till the end of the credits, the scene is just awesome.\",\n",
       " \"OMG!!! This movie cannot be simply described in words. If you loved X men first class then this movie is a treat for you. This is a movie even non-x men fans will enjoy. Go see this movie guys. Your mind will be blown. I've already seen this movie and looking forward to see it again. Hugh Jackman does the best wolverine ever. He became the wolverine i wanted to see on screen for ages. The interesting chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is more enjoyable than ever. But jennifer lawrence and Evan Peters at Quicksilver steal the movie. Quicksilver may not look so cool but he is the coolest guy in the whole movie. Believe me, this movie is worth your bucks. Moreover there are a bunch of new x men characters introduced in the movie which make it more enjoyable.Bryan Singer has done complete justice to this movie. And there is one scene just halfway through the movie which is worth watching fifty times. I am thoroughly excited to see the next entry entry in series which is being called Apocalypse.The only shortcoming in the movie is the runtime which feels a little less being only 130 mins. Rest of the movie is a jigsaw which fits together in a wondrous puzzle.So you must go to see this movie. Every element is in a balanced form. Even the soundtrack is fitting. Happy watching !!!!\",\n",
       " \"The Parisian premiere was yesterday and therefore, I actually did see the movie and let me tell you this: all the waiting and fuss around this movie is well worth it and well deserved. It is a great movie, easily relatable in many ways.I won't say a word about the acting. When you have established actors such as McAvoy — who repeatedly stole the screen with his heart-clenching performance — and Fassbender, along with their older 'counterparts' — McKellen and Stewart — you are in for a treat when it comes to the acting performance itself. No surprise there.This movie is a great movie in the sense that it finds its source in the very core of humanity's struggles, and shows that Xmen's themes — much like Marvel's latest movies — are still very relevant in the world today. You will see that yourself.The movie is action packed. There is no irrelevant scenes — I tend to judge movies by the ratio of irrelevant scenes per minute in it — and there is no break between action scenes and more emotional, storyline scenes. You won't be bored. But along with the action, and the acting, there is also the usual dose of humor found in most Marvel movies, without being out of place and without cutting the pace of the movie in itself. There, Hugh Jackman will provide you with a few laughs, or at least, will bring a smile to your face.The cinematography in itself was excellent. Excellent use of the 3D. Great camera work — at some point, you will be rather amazed by the use of slow mo and 3D.So, why not 10 out of 10 then? Because of the score. If the soundtrack was good, it didn't match what I got used to with the recent Marvel movies. Good score but not as good as I expected it to be. Maybe it was because we were all more focused on the fast-paced action scenes and the storyline in itself rather than whatever was playing behind. I might need to go back and watch it again once it's out for general public to really appreciate the little details that I might have missed in a cinema filled with excited fans.But over all, it was an excellent, entertaining and relevant Xmen movie. A good movie. A great Xmen movie. Full of Easter eggs for more hardcore fans as well. The waiting was worth it.\",\n",
       " \"Right now, I'm still trying really hard to find out one bad thing from the X-Men movie I've just seen: The characters maybe ? No: every single character is perfectly represented,interpreted (in particularly with a stunning James McAvoy and an impressive Michael Fassbender) and useful to the story. Maybe the plot then ? No: you'll get easily into it, because it is very well written for the screen, meaning you will be transported as Bryan Singer seems to know perfectly how to put in place a very cinematic puzzle. Emotions ? You will get some, as long as you loved the original X-Men characters. The soundtrack ? It is spotless and superbly fitting. Visual Effects ? Always there when we want them to be, and not when it is unnecessary. Action scenes ? You'll be amazed, thrilled and captivated when you will realize that every single scene has a purpose, whether it has some action or simple emotions and character's development.All these qualities put together are forming a very classical but excellent & accomplished movie, completed by a skilled sense of cinematic continuity that we didn't have since Singer left the franchise (at least until X-Men First Class). In other words, you should not be afraid to see this movie, because if you don't want to be disappointed, I can tell : you won't be. But is the future of this X-Men movie truly set ? This is something you'll have to figure out by yourselves, and this until the very end of the credits...\",\n",
       " \"Ahhh the X-men Franchise.There's the good: X-men, X2 and x-men first class and the bad: X3, god dammit Brett Ratner.But with a familiar face returning to the franchise Its easy to say the franchise is being brought to life and exceeding new levels with Days of future past.So as always I will rank this art film as 1.Acting, 2.Plot, 3.Sfx and 4.Flaws, 5:Direction.1:The acting:The acting was superb.Hugh Jackman is as good as always playing the 6 foot 3 Canadian with anger issues.Micheal Fassbender and especially James McAvoy gave praising performances as the younger counterparts of Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen.Micheal Fassbender shows how cold and calculating Magneto is making him the bad-ass super villain.James McAvoy gave a shuddering performance as a broken down Charles Xavier who's lost his way.Evan Peters was great as the speedy quicksilver(I doubt avengers 2 quicksilver will beat this one)who stole the show for the part he was given.Jennifer Lawrence was also good as the troubled Mystique.10/10 2.The Plot:In 2023, the mutants face the biggest threat yet:the sentinels, which are mutant killing robots made by Bolivar Trask, 50 years ago.The sentinels are so advanced that they adapt to any mutant power.So what do they have to do to stop the massacre?They have to send the Wolverine back to the past to change the future.Sounds good right?10/10 3.SFX:The GCI was simply stunning.The sentinels (both future and past)looked amazing.The mutant powers were awe strucking(especially quicksilver's superhuman speed).10/10 4.Flaws:Although the X-men franchise is pretty flawed some things were explained.Like how Charles could walk.How Hank Mcoy was still human in X2.But some questions remain unanswered.Like did Logan ever undergo the weapon X procedure?How is professor X still alive?Well we still have X-men:Apocalypse coming up so they might be awnsered.9/10 5.The direction:After 3 blockbuster movies, it really shows how Bryan Singer knows how this team of outcasts functions(Not you, Brett Ratner).He really knows how this team works and there's heart in this film (unlike the Avengers).There's a right amount of action, dialog and emotion to this film.Worth buying.Overall:10/10.This flick is a perfect blend of everything.Even if your-re not a fan of superhero movies this one is still going to surpass your expectations.Its worth it.Cant wait for Apocalypse, Bryan Singer.\",\n",

       " \"Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the Indiana Jones trilogy and definitely the best. This movie redefined what an action adventure movie could and should be. After the epic Horror Adventure that is Jaws comes the epic action adventure, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie easily deserves 10 stars for it's sheer innovation, directing, visuals, and entertainment ability. Here's why. Harrison Ford is a perfect choice for the awesome hero, Indiana Jones. An archaeologist who dreams of fortune and glory, he embarks on an adventure to find the Ark of the Covanent and save it from the Nazis. Harrison Ford is perfect in this role and it's so refreshing to see a badass hero that everybody can root for simply because he's awesome and embodies everything we want from an adventurer. Every moment of him is simply cinematic gold and it makes him shine against everyone else, even himself as Han Solo. That's not to say that the supporting actors aren't great, they are, but he's the main character and he steals the show which he should. Steven Spielberg really went out of his way with this masterpiece. The practical effects and stuntwork isn't just phenomenal, it's almost godlike! The action is jaw dropping in its awesomeness to the point where it almost doesn't even look like a movie, it looks like a portal into somebody else's universe: Spielberg's universe. What visual effects that are used are so good that it makes modern day action flicks look like stupid college projects that got F's. Michael Bay ain't got nothing on Golden Age Spielberg! Every scene screams with action and it just gets better and better all the way through but it never forsakes the story in place of action. Modern day directors need to take notes from this movie. Once somebody watches this movie, you soon find yourself in a trance in which you can never get sick of it. Nobody can get sick of Indiana Jones, it's not possible. Go watch this movie and you will be very pleased. Or just listen to the Golden John Williams music, that works too.\",\n",
       " 'Rating: **** out of ****There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fast-paced adventure packed with one death-defying cliff-hanger situation after another. To this day, Raiders remains one of the best action movies, holding up better than most of today\\'s rapid-cut, MTV-style \"thrill rides.\" Raiders relied on no CGI, no flashy editing, just pure, exhilarating film-making and storytelling, a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Harrison Ford stars as Jones, an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora, armed with a revolver and lion-taming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he\\'s used to these adventures (especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom, which was a prequel). When he returns to the states from his latest \"excavation,\" he\\'s informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant, an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first, in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.There\\'s probably little doubt that Raiders is the fan/critical favorite of the trilogy, but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about, blasphemous as it may be. For one, even though the story is excellent, it\\'s not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film\\'s opening scenes, when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it\\'s such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also (spoilers), one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark, the Nazis would a) have never found it or b) still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.The action sequences are superb, though an early bar shootout isn\\'t quite as adrenaline-pumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film\\'s other action scenes. Thankfully, the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall, I\\'d still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there\\'s no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.As bitchy as I may sound, I\\'m not trying to harp on Raiders, at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous (and deservedly so) truck chase, one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I\\'ve ever seen (and given an extra boost by John Williams\\' beautifully rousing score). To this day, even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, this sequence has yet to be surpassed.Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes, imposing statues, and well-preserved mummies, and Jones\\' mano-a-mano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre, climaxing things with a truly memorable (and quite frightening) light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who\\'s seen Raiders knows what I\\'m referring to (as well as its sequels)I\\'ve said it before, Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones, embodying a hero that\\'s cool beyond words, yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn\\'t as up to par: Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy\\'s love interest, but there are an equal share in gems, particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah (The Last Crusade wisely gave these actors/characters more screen time).Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema, paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched and/or surpassed it, but some have actually come close (The Mummy). If you haven\\'t seen Raiders yet, put it on the top of your list.',\n",
       " 'What are all those freakin\\' bulls**t reviews with 7 stars and less?\\nEspecially 1 or 2 stars? Persons who recommend garbage movies like The Mummy or Tomb Raider instead of this instant classic!\\nI consider them NOT to be cineasts and not to have any clue of filmmaking.Why is INDIANA JONES a classic character? Well, you see it in the first minutes of this one. It is simply one of the best and coolest introductions of a main character.\\nAnd hands down, Harrison Ford is so much better than all other \"Adventurers\", because he is charismatic, charming, cool and smart.RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK still is an cinematic experience. Not this rubbish modern CGI, shaky cam garbage, causing headache to normal thinking people.RAIDERS has a very good cast, with Karen Allen, Paul Freeman (especially him), Ronald Lacey, John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliott.\\nOne of John Williams\\' best scores! A soundtrack lke this one (or the Bond movies in the 60s, 70s and 80s, Rocky, Star Wars etc.), you won\\'t find anymore.\\nThese were the times were a soundtrack had tunes to remember and not just loud, dumb and monotone sounds.\\nLegendary composers like John Williams, Ennio Morricone, John Barry, Bernard Herrmann or Jerry Goldsmith.\\nThe cinematography, by another legend Douglas Slocombe, is just fantastic. Real sets, real locations, suspense and humour...and not humour of the silly sort like half of the MCU or The Mummy, because Indiana Jones is a serious character with a lot of irony, but he knows his situations and doesn\\'t dance in front of the baddies in a very serious and dangerous situation (just fpr some lame, silly laughs).',\n",
       " \"I greatly enjoyed the original story, the book La Reina del Sur by Arturo Pérez-Reverte. I listened to the English translation on audiobook and was drawn in to Teresa's story.The telenovela, starring the amazing Kate del Castillo, was a wild and intense ride. It greatly expanded the 'world' of Teresa and we got to spend more time actually with her and seeing her experiences rather than in the book where it was mostly told from outsider POV.What I like about this new show is that it seems to be walking a nice line between the more serious and down to Earth aspects of the novel while injecting the adrenaline pounding flash as well as first person focus on Teresa that the telenovela did.The changes are enough that you kind of know what's going to come next, but not really so you are still tense with anticipation and worry.The writing, acting and directing really feel on point and I'm super excited to see where the next 12 (and hopefully more) episodes go.\",\n",
       " 'My god, I did not expect this movie to be this good. I am a big fan of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and while I do think it is one of the better MCU movies, this one is just better in practically every way. The plot is well structured, and the pacing is great. The movie also explores its characters way more thoroughly than the previous one. The struggle of finding a place where you belong is a central theme, and every important character has their own struggles related to this. The performances are great as usual, every actor really brings their own flavor to their character. The movie also has great visuals, with all the wacky and fun ideas you might expect from a space movie. The action scenes are great, and the cgi is pretty flawless. The movie is also way funnier than any other MCU movie, with every character being a great source of humor. It\\'s so much comedy being presented it\\'s actually a little too much for me sometimes. Some of the characters feel like they exist only to be comic relief, even though they also have serious struggles that deserve a more serious treatment than they get. That is my only complaint though, as this is a movie with great plot, characters and visuals, as well as a fantastic climax, even though they pulled the whole \"saving the world\"-plot point again. This is one of my favorite MCU movies and space movies in general, it\\'s a great time and I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " \"Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.Masterpiece.The Good:Cast are great againCharm returnsExcellent nostalgic soundtrackLooks amazingThe Bad:Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes awayMichael Rosenbaum was wastedThings I Learnt From This Movie:Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor\",\n",
       " \"Another enjoyable entry, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is very good fun.I actually didn't find the story in this as interesting as in the first film, but the humour - which is still up to the mark in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - is much greater here; it got more laughs from me, that's for sure. The ending to this is also entertaining.Chris Pratt and Co. are just as enjoyable as before, with Dave Bautista particularly standing out to me here; if only due to his amusing moments. I like the addition of Pom Klementieff, I can see a spot for her in the crew. Kurt Russell and Elizabeth Debicki make for contrasting newcomers, Russell is just about good but I felt Debicki and her lot were underused/unintriguing.Not the most compelling plot, which I found more predictable than what the MCU usually produces, but the strong action end and noteworthy humour elevates it to become a pleasant film to watch; if a drop from the original.\",\n",
       " \"The first film was the most unexpected. That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well. Not the same good, but stood to the expectation of the first film's success. This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.It's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.James Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies.

       " \"*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*As a huge fan of the first film, I went to watch the movie as soon as it came out. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene and it doesn't end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they succeeded at that.I have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price, because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it's this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie's long duration.The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It's simply one of these movies that are always fun to watch.\",\n",
       " 'Full disclosure: I love the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and it wasn\\'t until 3 years after this movie came out that I finally saw it (there are several reasons for that). I\\'d heard from others that this movie was very good, but not quite as strong as the first one. After seeing this movie finally though, I don\\'t know what they were talking about. This movie was every bit as strong as the first movie, if not stronger in a lot of ways.I won\\'t spoil anything about this film, but I will say that Quill\\'s father is one of the most interesting characters they\\'ve had in marvel films, and the fact that he\\'s played by Kurt Russell certainly doesn\\'t hurt.\\nThe story is more interesting and fun than the original, with a lot of very well crafted jokes within the movie. There are some that overstay their welcome just a little bit, but as a whole, they are all great.My favorite aspect of the film was there was no sign of MCU in this movie really at all. There were no random cameos from other marvel superheroes, and there was no \"infinity stones\" or other nonsense like that in this movie. Not saying those things are bad necessarily, but it just feels so nice not having to deal with unnecessary shoehorning in of Marvel things. This was kept relatively tame in the first one as well, but the macguffin in that film was an infinity stone, but this film was it\\'s own separate thing and that made it feel fresh. It didn\\'t even feel like a superhero movie all that much if I\\'m honest.I don\\'t rate many superhero movies as highly as this, but this one is great. Go watch it if, like me, you put off watching it for fear of not being good.',\n",
       " \"The best thing about Marvel is also the worst thing: They always try to outdo themselves with the next film in the MCU. Sometimes it really works like with this film, and Captain America 2 and 3, and sometimes it doesn't like with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. But the advantage is they know how to keep making it better. They take fan's criticisms and complaints into account and try really hard to fix them. Such is the case with this film. Not that I had anything to complain about with part 1, but man, this definetely beats part 1 by a lot. Everything about this is better. The pacing, the story, the dialouge, the humor, and even the soundtrack. It manages to keep the style, spirit, and tone of everything we loved about the first film while also breaking new ground with it. It's very hard to make lightning strike twice, especially with a film with as weird a premise as Guardians of the Galaxy. By all accounts, the first film shouldn't have worked. Even more so the case with this film. Marvel has managed to do the impossible twice now. This is good, because it proves they're willing to take risks, but this is also bad, because now they'll be forced to outdo themselves every time, until eventually they'll be crushed by their own unattainable expectations. I'm very worried this will happen in the near future, especially as new films come out with new characters and new crossover films. Will we eventually be too greedy and want more and more and bigger and better each time until we're disappointed? I hope not. I know this isn't really a review of the movie, so much as it is about Marvel, but it's getting really had to keep this spoiler-free. Trust me, this is one film where you want to go in knowing as little as possible. Don't read the comics, don't use social media until you've seen the film. And I cannot stress this enough: Do not leave until ALL the credits have finished!!!!.\\nThere is a total of 5 (Yes, FIVE) end credits scenes. And all are important especially as we gear up for Infinity War.\\nGrade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars\",\n",
       " \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is such a glorious celebration of all that's enjoyable about going to the movies. It makes you feel you've gotten your money's worth, from the ticket price to all the expensive food and drink items. Everyone in the theater walked out chatting and laughing about the movie. I can't think of a way to make a more enjoyable movie than GOTG 2.From the beginning, the MARVEL STUDIOS logo has changed. While it's slowly creeping on screen, we used to see comic pages flipping. That's now replaced with movie footage, and the music is now epic, making the MS logo feel more classy and majestic.The opening credits scene is just so creative, and a scene like that could very well be one of the best ending scenes in another movie. But in GOTG 2, it's just the opening! Looking back on the entire film, I can't believe in this age where we're all so used to seeing flashy space and combat action scenes, everything gets better and better as this movie rolls along towards the ending.This is a really character-driven movie, and every single main actor gets fantastic screen time. No one is in the background. They all shine. Jokes are non-stop, and there are WAY more jokes in this sequel. Some of the humor is so unexpected and wacky that you'll just burst out loud laughing! You'll hear other people in the theater continue to laugh as the movie rolls on and you'll laugh again just thinking about what happened on screen.As funny as this movie gets, you'll be pleasantly blindsided with some extremely heartwarming scenes between characters. How can a movie make people laugh so hard, then the next minute have everyone sobbing, or at least fighting back tears? If you're the type of movie-goer who likes to brag that you didn't cry through an emotional scene, prepare to get tested. GOTG 2 has many emotional scenes, and they happen at the weirdest, most unexpected times. My bet is, you WILL cry at least once. There's just too many good scenes coming at you and you'll stumble. This movie is such a rare roller-coaster of emotional ups and downs. Enjoy the ride! The end credits are filled with things to keep you sitting in your chair. Don't make the mistake of walking out. There are something like 5 or 6 end scenes dispersed through the credits. You'll see people in the theater standing to leave, then sitting. Standing again, then sitting down. There's just so much going on in the end credits!From start to finish, this movie has everything and the kitchen sink thrown in. It's all bigger, better, funnier and way more emotional than the first GOTG, and easily the most entertaining thing you might witness this year in the theater. Don't miss this movie!\",\n",

       " 'The Marvel universe gets tenser with the most-awaited \"Civil War\". For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel\\'s biggest properties.\"Captain America 3\" starts off where \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.It is a huge help that the Russo Brothers returned to hold the weights of Marvel\\'s Phase Three, after their spontaneous effort in \"The Winter Soldier\". Though \"Civil War\" may not be as solid as its predecessor, it is still a worthy addition to the Avengers storyline and Captain America\\'s saga. Yet, it excels for taking a mature route that brings a compelling character study, a token from the first Avengers movie. Out of such character study is the major theme of vengeance. I am not going to give any more details about it. It is best to be seen and be enamored by how such themes are delivered with an affecting yet entertaining vibe.Kudos to the cast ensemble that all brought their A-game, even though some characters are not that fleshed out, or feeling shoehorned. Evans is at his most moving as the fading patriot who wishes the best for his team and loved ones. Downey Jr. is still what we expected from RDJ. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has a neutral but affectionate presence, despite her rather little involvement. The rest of the cast is great to see, with notable breakout performances from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, Chadwick Boseman as T\\'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo is a better addition to Marvel\\'s lacking lineup of antagonists. But despite the cast\\'s collective efforts, there is an obvious battle for screen time with all characters. Thankfully, it was all salvaged as the two parties brawl in a cleared airport, in an exhilarating action sequence that will surely make every audience member cheer.For all the makings of a summer blockbuster, \"Captain America: Civil War\" gets it all started right. Besides being a loyal companion to the comic book storyline, it is a worthy setup to Marvel\\'s other properties and one that truly can hold on its own, courtesy of its consistent superhero action scenes, the Russo brothers\\' tense direction, the excellent cast, its thought-provoking themes and its exciting story with its signature Marvel snappy dialogue. Let us hope for the best for MCU\\'s future, including Tom Holland\\'s \"Spider-Man\".',\n",
       " \"Not a huge fan of superhero movies, but this is good.The implementation of comedy for a movie like this was needed to be executed carefully and they managed to pull it off. While the tension builds between Captain America and Iron Man, we get to deeply explore their character motivations and beliefs throughout the movie.With the previous heroic acts that Tony Stark had, we are now met with a guilty and troubled character. His matured character arc was interesting to dissect because we see him constantly trying to contain each member of the Avengers and take responsibility for their actions while handling the diplomatic relations and internal heartbreak that was caused by Pepper Potts.On the opposite corner, we have Steve Rogers who is fighting for his beliefs even if he has to go against the law just to protect his long time friend Bucky. These character depths add emotional weight to the story which leads us to have more difficulty on which team to root for as both sides have been well developed. The new heroes that are introduced to us in this movie are Black Panther and Spider-Man.They were given enough screen time and their performances were amazing. I'm surprised that Black Panther was given a lot of screen time considering that the audience isn't familiar with his background. Spider-Man was a strong element in this film. The scenes he's in provide comedic relief, but his CGI suit looked very unrealistic and half-baked.\",\n",

As always, Marvel made a great movie. What did I like about it? Explain in order.1. The plot. In \"Confrontation\" the plot turned out to be very interesting and, most importantly, not trivial. It is difficult to determine until the very end which of the heroes is right and who is not, and even if you have taken some position, at the same time it is difficult not to understand the other side of this conflict. In this story, every hero, every team is both right and wrong. In the struggle of heroes, everything can not be clearly divided into black and white, and in this contradiction there is a huge plus of the plot of the picture.Humor, although it\\'s not so much, is still present and remembered. Especially, in this regard, the scenes with the Person-Ant and the Spider-Man are strong.Also very pleased with the final of the picture, which turned out to be as contradictory and ambiguous as the confrontation itself.\\n2. Characters. Heroes and their motives are revealed in the film quite full and do not make them doubt. Of paramount importance are, of course, the leaders of the warring teams - Captain America and Iron Man.The captain does not appear to us as an ideal hero, but a man who is compelled to go against all to protect his friend and the ideals in which he believes.Iron man is also shown somewhat differently, he believes that all heroes need control and are ready to obey a new law, which, he believes, will be able to protect the world from new dangers.Among the new heroes is worth mentioning the Black Panther, who plays one of the main roles in the film. For him, the film is like a test before his own solo project and we get about him only an initial presentation.Of course, one can not help noticing the Spider-Man, who personally for me was one of the main reasons for going to the movies. The spider turned out really new. It\\'s hard to say whether he will be the best of all previous ones, but I can say with confidence that he is already sharply different from his previous incarnations, largely due to the fact that the role was taken not by an adult, but by a real teenager. Separately, it is worth mentioning and the voice of the character, the voice reflects perfectly that the hero is just a child and an inexperienced superhero who is just starting his fight with Evil. In my opinion, the filmmakers correctly decided that they did not once again show the story of the origin of the character, but present it as a ready-made hero.The new villain Helmut Zemo turned out to be very interesting and memorable, thanks to the fact that he is the most ordinary person who managed alone, using only his mind and hatred, to resist the Avengers. It will be interesting to see this character in future films as well.\\n3. Action. Action, as in any film on the comic books Marvel, is one of the main components and here he, as usual, at the height. I have nothing more to add here.In the end, before us is one of the most successful films of the cinematic universe of Marvel, which allows us to take a fresh look at familiar characters and leaves us in a pleasant anticipation of future films.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m not a big comics guy nor do I really follow all of the \"super hero\" type movies that seem to be coming out every couple of months or so... at least before the China virus super villain invaded Hollyweird and the rest of humanity. But I really like the Captain America series for its generally pro-America/Liberty/Freedom stance and its ability to tell great stories related to the times we are in without flinching and with only names and fancy uniforms to stand in for the real-world entities they mirror.\"Civil War\" is a magnificent embodiment and reflection on our divided political views and the sometimes harsh realities that come with being \"free\" and defeating tyranny: Do we play nice and appease the evil forces in the world for the sake of avoiding potential collateral damage in confronting them now before they get too strong to defeat? Or do we look the other way and pretend the forces of evil aren\\'t there and continuing to grow as we paper over the reality with formal systems of appeasement such as the UN in an attempt to lend credibility to our cowardice? Do we face ridicule and punishment for standing up to evil now even though the inevitable costs of doing so will be high? Or do we keep our mouths shut and hope for the best while knowing that eventually, everything we hold dear will be destroyed if we ignore our consciences? Or do we do the right thing anyway and accept our roles as outcasts and scapegoats in the eyes of the very society we save from itself?This is a pretty serious film about a very serious time in the history of our world which is now. Bravo to the studio and all involved for making such an unflinching piece of \"fiction.\"The only reason I give it 9 stars instead of 10 is because I believe that the use of CGI is excessive and distracting. I think a lot of the scenes could have done without it or used some other \"real\" methods to get the same effect. At some point you have to ask if the film is live action or a cartoon. And while it is a mix of both, it relies a little too much on the later. Obviously some scenes could not be done without CGI but many could have been done without it... as with fight scenes between two or more characters which could have been done live action but CGI characters were used instead. This to me is just distracting and it pulls me out of the film. Plus there were some other things that bothered me such as the under-explained absence of The Hulk and this new character \"Cross-Bones\" that, while I know his background, just seems unnecessary, underdeveloped and gets lost in a sea of other much more important and interesting characters.Also, the witty banter, tough-guy (gal) one-liners and super-stylized poses and moves starts wearing thin really quick. It\\'s just too much. Much of the dialog, I\\'m sure, is designed to inject comic relief but it winds up feeling forced and inappropriate much of the time... like when \"friends\" are fighting and practically trying to kill each other they like to quip back and forth with jokes or comments of admiration on their fighting styles or their snazzy outfits. Just not very appropriate and is in juxtaposition to the serious nature of the situations. Sort of like your oncologist telling you a \"bald guy\" joke while you are dying of cancer. Again, pulls me right out of the film.If they can stop going overboard with the CGI and constant cringe-worthy attempts at tough one-liners and failed comic relief, they will have a great formula for future films. Overall a great movie and well worth the viewing.',\n",
       " \"I was one of the few fortunate people who got to watch this early. This movie was everything i hoped Civil War to be. It was funny, got you emotionally involved and Action Packed. Yes! the action is done brilliantly. The best I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Maybe one of the best in movies in general. This movie is not your average comic book good vs evil movie. It's much of a clash between ideologies which was really interesting to see. I also have to talk about how Spiderman was portrayed in this movie. I really liked him. As expected he was not the focus of the movie. However, he was not just a cameo either. The few scenes he was in the movie was enough to like him. If i have to point out flaws there is hardly any. Marvel is almost perfect. Almost. I do have one problem with the movie. It was the main villain. Like other marvel villain, this villain just didn't work for me. The movie would have done fine even without the villain. It feels like he was just there because ...he was just there!. But it's not a deal breaker people!! The story isn't about the villain. It's about Civil War. And you're gonna get it.. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe me guys, the 1 star reviews are all from Marvel haters. They just can't accept the fact that Civil War was a great move. Most of those reviewers probably haven't even watched the movie. Ignore the haters and watch the movie. You won't be disapppointed.\",\n",
       " \"There is no absolute right or wrong position on both sides of the civil war.\\nThe United States team is the embodiment of very justice , he believes in truth, goodness and beauty, he believes in the kindness of winter soldiers (in fact, winter soldiers are indeed manipulated by Hydra). Winter soldier is the only person in the world that the United States team has known since before he went to sleep, a spirit that no one can replace. A lot of people say the United States team is selfish, I don't think so. The Black Widow finally helped the United States team and the winter soldiers leave, so many people on the captain's side, not just a large number of people, but said that the captain's justice and salvation were accepted by more people.\\nAnd Iron Man, uh, only wanted to catch the winter soldier, and his conceit in the positive film made him not see the truth of the facts.\\nAfter reading the third book, it is heartache in two words. Why is the heartache?\\nThe fight between the American team, the winter soldier and the Iron Man, of course: the captain wanted to protect the winter soldier, Tony wanted revenge for killing his parents, and Tony was angry because the captain knew about it and didn't tell himself.

       " \"Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you're just not experiencing it properly.Taking the 1950's invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90's audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it's unlikely to do the same to today's overstimulated audiences, it's still an incredible visual feast. What's more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn't so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They're relatively safe bets.Watching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That's right folks, it's an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.Needless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they're quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can't really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again.\",\n",

This film is just damn good fun to watch...the explosions, the suspense, the cheesy one-liners...its not trying to tell you that aliens are coming to blow the s**t of of us...its entertainment. To all the people here that have said this is the worst movie ever...you guys need need to watch more movies, because if this is the worst movie ever then im Santa clause! To put it simply, this is 2 and a half hours of fun filled, edge of the seat (occasionally have a laugh) action...and nothing else.

Second: I love alien starships the size of New York. And you sure get that too. And third: I love dogfights. You get that too. Forth: I don't take it seriously.This films is one of the best of the decade, not simply because it works so well in an all-over scheme, but it provides some kicks that no other film had up to then (1996). Aliens arrive in gigantic spaceships and blow up a bunch of major cities. That's all I need.How to grapple with the fact that logic takes a backseat - please spare me.

       " 'Personally I think this is the best movie of the 90\\'s.But then I think South Park is the best TV show of the 20th century. Followed by Twilight Zone and Star Trek tying for second and third place.While there\\'s no accounting for taste in art, I can make reasoned arguments for my choices.The people here on IMDb who hate this movie and provide negative comments probably have their reasons too, but mostly they say stupid things. For example, the one vituperous reviewer who lambasted the film\\'s \"less-than-impressive CGI effects\". Well, duh, they didn\\'t use very much CGI as far as I know. They did special effects the old-fashioned way. This schmuck is complaining about reality not being very realistic?And if box office is any indication of excellence, then the stats are on my side and prove the nay-sayers are tasteless boobs. Make that witless, tasteless boobs. Independence Day is one of the highest grossing movies in history, worldwide sales topping a billion.Admittedly ID4 is one of those semi-rare movies that people either love or hate. And in this case hate with a passion. Why? I\\'m still trying to figure that one out, but so far I believe the whiniest critics are just your stereotypical jaded art critics: self-centered pseudo-intellectuals with attitude who pounce on any flaws in anything they personally don\\'t like just to show off their own vapid superiority. What do they want? Yes, the movie has flaws, but it also has a lot of plot, a lot of heart, and a lot of action. Dialog? I make fun of the dialog myself... so what? The worst criticism I can lay against the writers is that a lot of the dialog is inane... just like real people talk! That just makes it more realistic. Have any of these critics on here ever listened to how real people talk? In some cases the dialog is sooo frigging inane in ID4 that I marvel at it\\'s brilliance. Or chutzpah.\"What happened, mommy?\"\"I don\\'t know, baby\"As for the Apple-alien hook-up... my god, have we become so inured to the miracles of science that we calmly overlook or accept miracles like anti-gravity and kvetch instead about mundane technicalities? Yes, the Apple-alien computer hook-up is a plot hole... so what? I can easily explain that away a billion times easier than I can explain anti-gravity. I happen to know a bit about both.Again. Are there stupid things that happen in ID4? Sure. Checked reality lately? Stupid things happen all the time. But so do heroic things. As well as evil. Typical fare for the ancient tragedies. I believe ID4 carries on that ancient and honorable tradition: entertainment. And viewing it as a work of art, I must say that I was impressed over and over again while watching this film: where most of the studios would have wussed out or flinched, these film makers didn\\'t. They stepped up to the plate and tried to beat the ball to death over and over again with their bat.And you know what? These film makers did it with a hint of humor. Not bad at all.',\n",

       " \"My Take: Perfection in its own silly, explosive, action-packed way. A highly entertaining blockbuster. I love the summer. It's the time every year or so, that we could sit back, relax and try to get back to your lazy self. You can go outside, fly kites, ride your bike across the countryside, go to the beach, stay at home and watch television, or go to the theaters and catch the latest in summer blockbuster releases. It was way back in the 1990's that these blockbuster flourished. It was almost every year or so, we get a film that tried to top the other. It was the busiest time for Hollywood.I wasn't much frequent on watching movies on the big screen back then, and only manage to watch these movies on video. I watched INDEPENDENCE DAY many years later, having missed it on both its exact release date and decade. I saw it on a post-summer night, just a few weeks after summer vacation just ended. Upon watching, I found myself enjoying everything about it. Rating it on a summer movie meter, it's terrific entertainment. The definitive summer blockbuster.INDEPENDENCE DAY has no moment to spare. It starts out quickly with the sight of a gigantic alien spaceship hovering over the craters of the moon, heading towards the Earth. The film has the usual news on Earth, like all invasion flicks, having the news spread, starting from a small organization investigating extraterrestrial activity, then to the military, who then phone calls The White House, giving it full news to President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman), who obviously remembers Michael Douglas' president performance in THE American PRESIDENT (but I didn't say lampoon), who stares in a moment of shock and disbelief.Before the sight of the alien spaceship hovering above the cities around the world, we first get a glimpse of the many characters in the film. First, there's computer engineer David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, in an excellent performance), playing chess with father Julius Levinson(Judd Hirsh) at Central Park. David is divorced from his wife (Margaret Colin), who happens to be the President's Chief-of-staff (see the connections). Then it switches to Kansas, where the focus is a small family. The father, Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a crop-dust farmer, believes he's kidnapped by aliens and is willing for payback, much to the dismay of his teenage kids. We also get introduced to a soldier (Will Smith), who both longs to return to NASA and reach for the stars (literally), and to propose to his girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox).Well, enough of that. It's time we see an invasion, and, boy, did we get one. After the discovery of the invaders plot (using the Earth's satellites to plan an attack), we get a mind-blowing sequence after another at incredible pace. The destruction at the streets of New York are just the first great effects-laden sequences in the film. Lets see, we get a STAR WARS-inspired dogfight between fighter jets and alien spaceships. And we also get a suspenseful sequence of an alien in laboratory (Talk about a close encounter), INDEPENDENCE DAY doesn't fail when it comes to a good visual feast. Admittedly, some of the effects are cheesy, seeing how much CGI has improved over the years, but they still provide an eye-filling experience.INDEPENDENCE DAY runs for a long 145 minutes, but director Roland Emmerich fills it with lots of fun and excitement, it just seems to pass by. Director Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin spares no moments and doesn't stop for a break, giving the film a roaring pace without a dull moment that can't be interesting. The photography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the film a good look, while composer David Arnold serenades the film with a rollicking and patriotic score.Forget its stereotype problems, INDEPENDENCE DAY is terrific summer entertainment that never fails to have me entertained.Rating: ***** out of 5.\",\n",
       " 'A fairly bad movie that feels like it was written by a teenager with no knowledge or life experience.Anthony Mackie, though unimpressive, did a passable job, whereas I cannot for the life of me understand the casting of Damson Idris, who was fairly bad, having no presence on screen and seemed to be acting on auto pilot.The writing was atrocious, seemingly trying to convey a message but falling short. The lead is supposed to have 56,000 hours of flight time which is also ridiculous, showing me how bad the writers actually are.\\n56,000 hours is 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, for over 6 YEARS...In the end, it is a silly implausible movie that you will forget moments after you watch it.Not Recommended.',\n",
       " \"Another year, another Netflix action film is here to watch, this time it is Outside The Wire and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drone pilot have to team up with android officer in an attempt to save the world.Main Character\\nAnthony Mackie plays Leo the android who I thought did a good job here and bought quite a bit to the role. He is basically the tough mentor and he does it pretty effectively, his character goes all over the place in the final act and it comes close to ruining it but it doesn't take away from his decent performance. But there is another main character Harp played by Damson Idris and I did not like this character at all. He does something at the beginning of the film that makes him unlikeable from the start and he never recovered for me and I never came around to care about him.Supporting Characters\\nThe supporting cast don't offer anything because the film doesn't try to make that happen. The bad guy is as generic and dull as you can imagine and everybody else in the film is barely here and they aren't given anything to really work with. The film only really cares about its too main protagonists and forsakes every other character here.Story\\nThe story is serviceable at best, I like the fact that Mackie's character was an android and how this world uses synthetics in general was pretty interesting and could have and should have been explored more. The film just doesn't do a good enough job of exploring it's themes and messages and the final act is so ridiculous and basically feels like it comes out of nowhere in order for the film to try and feel unique. Also the ending feels very abrupt, I don't know why lately it feels like films I watch are ending abruptly and this one is no different not answering all the questions it needs to.Script\\nThe script is fine, Mackie spits out some pretty good dialogue and the story does have a few good elements. Though like its story the script falls very short and tries to be more interesting then it is and it could have done with either focusing more on the interesting parts or just be a full on action film.Style\\nThe style of the film has some pretty decent action scenes that do show the horror of war. But the film doesn't do enough with what it has, probably because there wasn't the budget that the film really needed for something so ambitious.Overall\\nOverall, this is a below average action film that doesn't do anything to change up the game and really make it stand out and is one you can happily skip.\",\n",
       " 'This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well...What I love about the character is that Steve Rogers has \"I\\'m-a-man-out- of-time issues\" but he\\'s comfortable with the chaos that it brings. In acclimating himself to this century he is at his best. Yes, most people would be overwhelmed but because of who he is and where he\\'s from, he\\'s able to cope and adapt. The serum that gives him his physical edge also gives him a mental boost. It\\'s his emotions that are raw and unaided. Time has passed since Avengers so we don\\'t get to see his day to day amazement and adjustment. I\\'m glad they skipped that stuff. What we do see is the man who once represented America and has become alien to America and it\\'s slanted values. The passage of time. Add those struggles to a full blown conspiracy film and what results might just be the best film released all year long.Steve Rogers is basically a John Wayne American. The world shifts to him and it\\'s his job to tell everybody \"Here\\'s they way things should be done.\" We saw that in Avengers and even the first film after he gathered his Howling Commandos. Now, the powers that be are a lot more flexible in terms of loyalties and how they\\'re going to get certain jobs done. How he handles this century\\'s gray morality is at the heart of the film.Like most men from the 1940\\'s, Steve keeps things to himself and keeps his emotions bottled up. (EX: the first film when he mentions his mother dying of TB and he was even embarrassed when Peggy found him mourning alone for Bucky) So, bringing The Black Widow in to this film gives him someone who is going to draw out his story, because he\\'s never going to offer it up of his own accord. Natasha learns from him. Fury learns from him. Sam Wilson learns from him. Yet, they all give him something in return. Every character used is utilized perfectly and smartly. Falcon for example, is not in awe of the legend of Captain America. This is exactly what Steve wants in a friend and in a fellow soldier, to not have to be Captain America. Everyone fits perfectly in to the plot and allows access to different beats, tones and emotional depth. Yes, conspiracy thrillers need depth and this one has it.Captain America is probably the only superhero left in this world of the reboot who is singularly heroic. He doesn\\'t have this dark existential quandary like other reinventions. Plugging that resolute goodness into a morally complex story means he doesn\\'t question what he believes, but he questions whether anybody else does anymore. He doesn\\'t question his foundation but he questions where he has ended up and what his role must now be. The conspiracy element and structure of this story helps in that Captain America is not up on a pedestal being self righteous, he\\'s in a corner and that makes you want to root for the guy. He believes in what he\\'s doing and the viewer is along for a great ride sharing that belief.Marvel movies usually establish character early. This one starts out fast but it\\'s got a lot of character in it. The first act packs a punch but does it laying the groundwork for a remarkable third act. They take time showing the issues and you immediately empathize with Steve. Giving us good character depth means the action delivers more punch. And the action here is beyond great. This movie absolutely punches you in the face in the best way possible. The action has advanced a lot from the first film. How he now operates in the world and kicks butt is all very impressive.So, this is probably Marvel\\'s grittiest movie and it\\'s also their best sequel to date. There\\'s a dash of humor but there\\'s mostly a wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film.',\n",
       " \"Went into the movie not expecting much as I felt that the first Captain America was one of the weaker movies in Phase one of the Avengers. However, this movie was one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.First off, the action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The characters all had their own amazing moments and the acting is decent as well. You get to see more of Nick Fury, and he was awesome in this. Black Widow is used much more in this movie and as well as being badass, she brings out more of the Captain's story. Sam Wilson (the Falcon) is great and is involved in some great action scenes. The villains in this movie were awesome as well.Quite enjoyed the story as well. There were a few twists; some unexpected, some expected. And the reveal of the unexpected twists in the final third were epic. The story is not just about Captain America and the Winter Soldier, there are darker forces at play and causes the Captain to ask dangerous questions.This movie is very entertaining, the story is decent, the ending is awesome and satisfying and I would recommend watching this. Makes for a decent political thriller as well. This will easily be one of my favourite movies.\",\n",
       " 'Now \"The winter soldier\" is everything a Captain America movie should be. While it maintains some of the humour that now has become the trademark of Marvel films, TWS is way more serious than all of them combined. And this is truly where the film feels so brave and yes different than any other superhero flicks that we have seen. Which brings me to the most important point, the plot. While of course it is not going to be the most original or complicated film of the century, there is the basic screen writing elements that so much lack from modern day blockbusters. You have the (likable) characters and a mystery they need to solve along with a racing clock. It reminded me the 70\\'s political paranoia thrillers (3 days of the Condor - another Redford link, The parallax view, Z) and it is a welcome tone that makes the WS to differentiate itself from the rest. There are strong scenes regarding political fear, control, and information manipulation but it never feels bloated or overbearing. the purpose is to entertain even if it manages to squeeze through a bit of political views with Rogers replacing the viewer\\'s voice on screen. At one point there is a talk about who is who which results in every man for himself mayhem in one of the most interesting sequences that you may see this year. We do not get this stuff these days!Besides the charged plot, the introduction of new characters and the mega mayhem in the streets of Washingthon DC, the Russos have found time (and they should bloody do since TWS is 2 and a half hours long!) to inject some sentiments in the proceedings - a visit to Peggy, a confrontation with Fury regarding SHIELDs actions, Bucky\\'s memory recall, Natasha\\'s kissing talk. They could have easily skip these \"crap\" but instead the extra running time feels adjusted and coherent with a bit of more characterization which results to bring us closer to the on screen counterparts. However, the action is what took me by surprise. The bar has been set higher now. It is truly unbelievable to think that these two directors (of the \"Community\" fame) came with such inventive ways of using Cap\\'s shield. Finally, the shield gets to be seen in all of its glory. In addition, all the fist fights (and they are many) are excellent examples and putting the glasses to the school of frantic edit (which I truly despise) with varied and rapid choreography. A terrific elevator fight sequence probably stands out as truly memorable whereas the encounters with the Winter Soldier never feel repetitive. The Russo brothers keep changing the game from stealth and cloak missions, to car chases, to gun fires, to dog fights, to fist fights. There is something for everyone here and it is arguably among the finest I have seen. Impressive considering their credits. Real stunt work (backflips, wrestle moves, somersaults, etc), real fights and it is a pleasing sight to go away from superhero duels of the Avengers, Thor and Iron man. These characters rely on instincts and bullets. No more and no less and most of them do have some brutal moments for a PG-13 film (and blood too).The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. While Evans came out as a bit arrogant in the \"Avengers\" and the least interesting character, here he truly shines. First time ever, I actually bought what he was bringing on the table. This is a soldier who believed in protecting the people and their freedom. Here though, in the modern era of espionage with multiple intrigues and political events, he finds himself unable to identify which side he is on and for what. At one point he even considers himself Fury\\'s caretaker of terrorist \"problems\". The other side of the coin is Samuel Jackson\\'s Nick Fury and Robert Redford\\'s Alexander Pierce. It is nice to see Jackson expanding his role from 1 minute cameo in \"Iron Man\" to a fully supporting actor here. But the real standout is Robert Redford. Kevin Feige (the producer) probably knows how to do casting because so far there has not been a single acting mistake. Bringing heavy-acting-weight Redford to a superhero film is actually a bold move and while most movies do not focus on the talented cast, here the Russo brothers give Redford plenty of close ups and necessary gravitational dialogue that kept surprised me for a \"summer\" and \"mindless\" blockbuster. Antony Mackie plays Falcon believably enough and it is very good to see a great supporting turn instead of being the comedic sidekick. The winter soldier now himself is as you would have expected? probably the best villain outside Loki(!) in the marvel films. A truly unstoppable and cool killing machine that shows no remorse or regret considering his complete disregard (and destructive) actions throughout the film. Shaw manages to bring a bit of menace to a generally light hearted series of fantasy films as he has to act more with his eyes rather than sharing any scenes of actual dialogue. Is it perfect? Of course not but it does not feel that it is drugging forever or raising any boring flags. There is plenty of plot, intelligence and sweet characters moments to keep anyone satisfying. This is blockbuster at its finest, a superhero film with heart, immersive action and subtle touches of humour. Totally recommended.',\n",
       " \"There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be.\",\n",
       " 'CAPS LOCK FOR ADDED EMPHASIS! THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF OF BATTLE ROYALE! And before any of you smart alecks decide to say \"how can it be a rip off when its based off a book\", the answer is simple:Battle Royale came out in 2000, Hunger Games was published in 2008. Not only that, this isn\\'t even a decent rip off. It has a stupid one sided love story and its just generally a kid friendly Disney-esk Hollywood piece of poop. No seriously, if you think this is even remotely good, then just go watch Battle Royale... seriously. Exactly the same plot, with the exception, Battle Royale is bloodier, has a better story and is based in a real world country (japan) rather than some made up magical land of pixies and clothes that catch fire but don\\'t burn people.I\\'ve seen both, Battle Royale is epic, this is just lame.',\n",
       " 'Seeing the \"Hunger Games\" series gain so much recognition is difficult to fathom; especially when it\\'s more or less a blatant copy of \"Battle Royale\", a Japanese novel (1996), movie (2000), and manga (2000-2005). I\\'ve read the entire series of \"Hunger Games\" (2008), and not only is the writing style bland, but the plot is exceedingly unoriginal and not \\'unique\\' like many of you are claiming it to be. Like the \"Battle Royale\" manga, \"Hunger Games\" includes love triangles, a group of teenagers randomly chosen (BR: by class HG: by district), plans to overthrow authority, teens given weapons and forced into a death match, a pair working together to undermine the game with the help of an older mentor who had previously won the game, both female and male main leads, a corrupted government, signal fires and bird calls, a reality TV show program (which IS in the English adaption of the manga (2006) for the series unlike many of you have known), and the list goes on and on. Evidence of these unconcealed similarities can be found on various Internet articles (whose writers I sincerely thank). I urge you to go right now and read the manga or novel of Battle Royale online so that you can compare the two series. The author of \"Hunger Games\" blatantly claimed (*cough* lied *cough) that she supposedly never even knew of \"Battle Royale\", so you can\\'t use \\'inspiration\\' as an excuse anymore. Instead, she blurted out nonsense about Roman mythology and the Iraq war since she doesn\\'t want to admit her source of inspiration is a contemporary. How convenient for her own success since \"Battle Royale\" is a Japanese series that isn\\'t well known in North America. She basically made an American-version of the series that contains less gruesome content and involves districts in place of school classes. Even if she truly did not know about \"Battle Royale\" or mysteriously forgot about it in the back of her mind, it is still part of an author\\'s job to confirm the originality of his or her own to-be published works through researching. I\\'m posting this all of over the web so that \"Battle Royale\" can at least receive some acknowledgment that the \"Hunger Games\" author denied. Sure enough, both series also share resemblances with \"The Lord of the Flies\" and \"The Running Man\". However, unlike the HR author, the BR author has not denied this inspiration. Moreover, the \"Hunger Games\" is more like a rip-off of \"Battle Royale\" than an inspiration since the majority of the plot elements are nearly identical. There\\'s a fine line between the words \\'inspiration\\' and \\'copy\\', and \"Hunger Games\" has extended far past it. There are also many popular American series that were inspired by Japanese series such as \"The Matrix\" from \"Ghost in the Shell\", however they rightfully gave credit for the \\'original\\' series\\x85 unlike a certain someone. I sincerely apologize if I seem rash with my word choice, but it\\'s so aggravating that Suzanne Collins had dare stated that she wasn\\'t inspired by \"Battle Royale\" when she clearly was. What\\'s more contemptible is that she\\'s getting not only famous from her rip-off, but she\\'s also obtaining vast amounts of money from it. But hey, that\\'s how reality works, right? Therefore, I don\\'t care if this is marked as spam or hauled with negative comments from \"Hunger Game\" fanatics. As long as it reveals to some people the credit \"Battle Royale\" genuinely deserves, then I\\'m satisfied. Nonetheless, the movie\\'s portrayal of \"Hunger Games\" is quite exceptional in comparison to other movies adapted from books, which is why I am rating this 2/10 instead of 1/10.',\n",
       " \"I am referring to the audience watching. Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.Apparently though the movie has not covered everything the novel had to offer (which should be no surprise). What should be a surprise to anyone who was living outside the US, is the fact, that this was one of the most anticipated movies in recent history (though I'm more than happy that The Avengers beat them at the total box office of course). Better drama, story and acting than Twilight, hopefully it stays that way and won't dwindle down the road ...\",\n",
       " '\"The Hunger Games\" was an instant hit when it came out, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m the last person in this universe to see it. Unfortunately, it sorta felt like I was wasting my time. The movie seemed like equal parts \"Running Man\", \"The Truman Show\" and \"Battle Royale\", but with all the clever elements from either of those movies removed. I don\\'t get a kick out of gratuitous violence or something, but spending the first hour on build-up that will barely have any effect on the plot is looooooooong. Take for example all the scenes where they have to impress possible sponsors (to provide outside help) with their fighting skill, sponsoring comes into play so rarely later on that all those scenes are completely cuttable. During the actual hunger game/battle royale, you still don\\'t get much of an action or adventure movie. They\\'re after pulling heart strings mostly, including the incredibly stretched-out death scene of a character we literally know NOTHING about (a full action-free hour wasn\\'t enough to establish some traits?). The most bothersome thing about the movie though it how freaking convenient everything is. Our main cardboard cutouts (granted, Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the material) are up against highly trained manhunters, heavily bleeding and leaving traces all over the forest. How do they not die on the first day? How does nobody spot them when they stand there crying and screaming in a wide-open space? Some other character lights a small fire and is killed within about three seconds, but I guess you can\\'t act stupid if you\\'re not important to the plot. The main characters don\\'t survive because they\\'re so strong, so creative, so quick or so fearless: they survive because the script says so. Therefor there\\'s barely any tension, you can predict everything beat for beat. Given its massive success this movie\\'s got to have lots of appeal, but it must have missed me by a mile.',\n",

Midoriya has wanted to become a hero all his life, despite the fact that he has no superpowers. One day he has given the opportunity to prove himself and practice to be a hero, a real hero. And then the story begins.In general, I liked main characters, the story and whole concept of series. The scenario is pretty good and I could see general experience gaining and individual character growth. There are many characters who have their own story in the background and go very well with the big story at the same time.

He\\'s a little weird, even a little crazy, but he\\'s very interesting, and he complements other characters very well.Although the words \"One for all, all for one\" are often mentioned in the series, it is certainly not the story about \"Three Musketeers\".

Why are male characters belittled in order to elevate the female ones? Just write them all better instead of doing it this lazy way.Events happen in ways that dont make sense and for no reason other than that the plot demands it.I know this isn\\'t a historical drama and I\\'m ok to suspend disbelief with a bit of artistic license, but the historical inaccuracies going on are so glaring it removes the viewer from the story entirely. It is made so much worse by sticking \"modern-acting\" characters in a society where such acts would be so out of place.Nothing wrong with a theme of feminism, but it is poor writing to shove the theme in our face every minute. The theme should speak through the actions of the characters, not them telling it to your face while looking at the camera.',\n",
       " 'I really wanted to love this movie.I\\'m the father of a 10-year old girl, and I firmly believe that we need more cool, smart, brave young female leads in movies, so that smart, cool, brave girls like my daughter has someone to look up to.So I was looking forward to seeing a clever young girl solving a difficult puzzle in a movie with subtle references to the old Holmes-stories.I did not get that at all.The premise of this story is that the mother of Enola, Sherlock and Mycroft disappears and leaves behind clues to where she is hiding.Apparantly, Henry Cavill\\'s Sherlock can\\'t be bothered to solve this rather simple paint-by-numbers case, so Enola steps in, but before the case really kicks off, our lead character meets a young viscount on the run, and the story turns into a YA love story instead.Apart from the lack of a good puzzle, the main problem with the movie is that it talks down to its audience. Instead of just showing us some strong female characters (and there are a lot of them in this movie, so that\\'s great) it insists on constantly telling us that \"the world is changing\" and \"you can choose your own path in life\". These not-so-subtle messages are sometimes even narrated directly to the viewer by the main character.The old saying \"don\\'t tell it, show it\" doesn\\'t seem to be something the film makers have ever heard of.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve seen many people have disliked the film because of \"historical inaccuracies\" and it\\'s feminist ideas. I must respectfully say, as much as I respect your opinions, you\\'ve missed the point of the film entirely.Enola Holmes was not intended to be a masterpiece by Scorsese/Tarantino/James Cameron/Peter Jackson/Spielberg/Nolan et cetera et cetera and leave you with a powerful message or a million questions. This is supposed to be a fun family action/mystery for people of all ages to enjoy, with a hint of that familiar character that is the iconic detective of Baker Street. The film succeeded in its aims to be fun, a film to watch with others to unwind after a long day and forget about life. This film, along with a great story and stellar cast led by the always spectacular Miss Millie Bobby Brown, is exactly what this world needs at this moment in time.The aforementioned cast did brilliantly in their roles. MiIlie Bobby Brown pulls the character off excellently, managing to be a perfect blend of Sherlock and a regular teenage girl, creating a fantastic original character. Cavill and Claflin were exceedingly good (and at some points rather humorous) in their roles of the Holmes brothers and Helena Bonham Carter brings her usual brilliance to the table in her role. The film itself is fantastic, managing to entertain whilst working in the underlying subplot and message of women\\'s rights.I\\'d highly suggest watching this film and if my argument hasn\\'t persuaded you, let me ask you this; why do we go to the cinema but to be entertained?',\n",
       " \"At first, I was quite excited when I noticed a new Holmes movie on Netflix. At first glance it seemed like great flick: A-list cast, centered around a great mystery and lovely decor. I didn't mind at all that the movie was centered around Sherlock's less well known sister Enola, and that the movie had some sort of feministic background.However, as the movie progressed, the latter became obvious to a point where it became very annoying and the movie itself, for it's time period, unrealistic (for example, a secret all-women jiu jitsu class in the early 1900s? Yeah, sure). All other classes, races and genders in the movie seem to have no troubles or problems at all, only the wonen. which at the time was certainly not the case.Also, as is unfortunately the case with many #metoo pleasing movies nowadays, the male characters were all either evil, bumbling idiots, or completely helpless with the sole exception of Sherlock Holmes, who doesn't get much screen time.Don't get me wrong, I love many movies with female lead characters (underworld, pan's labyrinth, resident evil, etc). I just really dislike this current wave of overcompensated feminist-focused movies that keep using the same old formula, and forget that there was actually supposed to be a decent plotline in the movie. Too bad, it could have been so much more..\",\n",
       " 'Annoying AF, and badly written. The constant 4th-Wall breaks by Enola destroys the narrative, the pace, it\\'s condescending, and becomes annoying, irritating.But the worst sin of the movie is characterization. Whoever wrote this has no understanding of Mycroft Holmes (here an insufferable chauvinist petit-maître millions of miles away from the understated genius, government superagent of the Conan Doyle books) and to add insult to injury, the characterization of Sherlock Holmes himself, despite the books, plays, movies and tv shows who clearly show what kind of character he is, his personality, and so on. Having Henry Cavill miscast as a sympathetic, charismatic, friendly, brotherly, caring Holmes is an irony in itself, after his utterly misguided casting as Superman, whom he played as depressive, brooding, uncharismatic emo dull bore that ruined that other classic franchise for years to come. He seems to be condemned to always miss the mark as an actor thanks to awful scriptwriters and poor characterization.A lot of chauvinists are giving low ratings to the movie because it\\'s allegedly \"feminist\", but that\\'s also far from the fact of why this movie fails, since it also lacks a mature and nuanced understanding of what feminism is.',\n",
       " \"In an age of dark, grim visions of the future Disney's Tomorrowland is a delightful throwback to upbeat adventures of the 60s and 80s, a retro sci-fi film for the whole family to enjoy.Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a bright and optimistic high school student who does not share the pessimistic views of elders. When Casey discovers a mysterious pin that shows her fantastic world and sets out to find the futuristic city with the help of a jaded inventor, Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Athena (Raffey Cassidy), an English-accented Audio-Animatronics.Tomorrowland is a deliberately old-fashioned film both its tone and visuals: the film was loosely based on the Disney ride of the same name - considering that Disney were able to turn Pirates of the Caribbean into a billion dollar film series. Bird was a wise choice to direct and co-write, The Incredibles had a 60s style sci-fi look to it and he brought that look to Tomorrowland. It was bright and colourful with its showing of various technologies, from robots, jetpacks, lasers and a steampunk rocket.Brad Bird has already shown himself to be a capable action director with Mission Impossible: Ghost Portrayal and with Tomorrowland he had much better CGI. There are some cool fight sequences, especially with Athena - it is awesome to see a little girl beating up fully grown men and giant robots. Tomorrowland is visually spectacular especially when we get to see the city in all its glory for the first time. Bird certainly brought out a sense of awe, whimsy and wonder.Tomorrowland also has a great trio in the leads: Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy are terrific together, having many witty moments together when they are travelling and there is a zip in their interactions, like when they use a knock-out tool. Although Robertson's look too old to be a high schooler she pushes off the necessary enthusiasm. But it was Cassidy who stole the show: she was a revelation as Athena, playing a character who was older than she actually looked and at times acts a Terminator. She personally reminded me of Saoirse Ronan when she was younger, just with dark hair.Although Tomorrowland had a talented director at the helm it also had a screenplay with Damon Lindelof's fingerprints, a man who has poor reputation as a screenwriter. As an adventure Tomorrowland is excellent but when it goes to the science fiction the film gets bogged down with mumbo-jumbo about time particles and destiny. This part needed to be expanded and more refined. When it's revealed that Tomorrowland was a place for exceptional people to come to where they would not disrupted by government or civil society. Essentially this is similar to Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a controversial sci-fi work that abdicates the philosophy of Objectivism, or if you prefer it's the ideology of Andrew Ryan in Bioshock. The prologue at the 1964 World's Fair could have been cut and it would have made the reveals more impactful.Tomorrowland is a good of romp of a film, providing plenty of laughs, action and visual spectcle. It was rated a 12A in the UK but it is on lower scale of that rating and could easily be enjoyed by children younger than that age.\",\n",

The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace.Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the negative reviews almost put me off, but I\\'m so glad I actually took the chance. Actually there\\'s one proviso here - and is probably something consistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination, or the yearning for a better world, then you\\'ll hate this movie. Or you want to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV actors. Or if you\\'re a reality TV actor. Or your kids can\\'t read or write because you don\\'t think it\\'s important.

I have never written a review before on this site, but after watching this movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments, if only to encourage others to watch it. I remember watching Star Trek as a child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets, most of which actually exist today. I wonder if many of the items seen in this movie will one day become reality as well, perhaps not in my lifetime, but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations of the creative people at Disney, who knows!

Think about the things you see, analyze them. Don\\'t expect to be on the edge of your seat all the time from exciting action, it takes a back seat after the beginning.. which the trailer seems to mostly contain and make a false picture of the film. My opinion.. I try and keep this spoiler free.While perhaps expecting a little more awe scenes, action and insight into the \"tomorrowland\" society the movie has some very nice scenes. 2/3 into the film it somehow got a bit boring.. but it gets better. Could perhaps have been cut on a place or too, but the scenes were visually pleasing instead. A few confusing aspects here and there like the transition at the end, but who cares? No one has seemed to bother analyzing the philosophical aspects of pre-determination, alternate realities and concepts like our consciousness creating our reality as an reflection of our collective state of mind. The message is a fine one and something to think about our outlook on life.Does all the negativity really serve us? What\\'s the content of news? Only negative stories. Do they encourage you to go out and make a difference or make you depressed and go on with business as usual it is all going to h*ll anyways? But it sells and is a money making mechanism.. It is a bit humorous the extent the level of fear the society in the movie are in and project unto the children and society, connections to our western society can be made too.If you notice these things you will appreciate the hints at secret societies and connections to the \"Club 33\" in Disneyland too and other goodies like the rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Edison. Nothing too profound or divulging from my understanding but it\\'s there too, Tesla is an under appreciated figure in our history who deserves a lot more recognition.These are the things I brought with me from this movie, and I\\'m a sucker for scifi, which was what initially attracted me to the film, but it turned out to just be eye candy to boot :) not the main thing about the film.',\n",

But this is fantasy, sci-fi and action at its best. It reminds me a lot of old 80s adventure films like Daryl, Flight of the Navigator, War Games etc. but more complex, modern effects and a wonderful cast.I hope this deserves a cult following or becomes a lesser known rare gem.

She is definitely one to watch and as long as she avoids the pitfalls that go with fame, she is pretty much guaranteed a very bright future in the acting business.The story is compelling and has a good message -- without sounding preachy. Lots of great classic science fiction homages in here, plus plenty of very cool modern ideas. It was great to see three generations of future aesthetic in the same film.In general, the pacing is pretty good. There are a few parts where it drags a bit. It makes up for it in spades in the last half of the film. Editing was expertly done with plenty of quick reaction cuts between actors to thread things together neatly.

It's one of the few modern family films that's actually genuinely enjoyable for all ages. Plus, you'll get to see some of Santiago Calatrava's more extravagant architecture.\",\n",
       " \"After watching Tomorrowland last night I have to say it is interesting and insane from Disney to create a movie like this.Like others I have seen the trailer for the movie. It was my nieces who asked me to watch it with them so I thought why not.The movie is not your normal Disney motion picture and I'm actually surprised that it got a PG rating. But more or less the film shall make you go WOW.The film has a original plot that you don't see too often also the visual effects are just breath taken they really brought their top talents to give us effects that will leave you in amazed. The Cast:George Clooney, Britt Robertson, Raffey Cassidy, Hugh Laurie made the film work with their performances George and Britt actually did a strong job in the film. There is also some good action that make you go that's insane. It actually surprised that they did this in a Disney movieHowever the film did stall a few times and part of the story didn't make any sense leaving you feel disappointed. Overall Tomorrowland took something different and ran with it so you might be surprised once you watch it.I give Tomorrowland an 8 out of 10\",\n",
       " 'I watched the trailer for this and it seemed like way to many things were happening in this movie. This meant that when i had the time to sit down and relax to watch it, i changed my mind and watched Maze Runner - Scorch Trials instead. This is a mistake that should not be made as that was so bad i can barely describe it.Anyways i decided i would watch it even though the trailer was a mess, and what a pleasant surprise. It was not messy in any way and it got me hooked from very early on. It has amazing visuals, great casting and a very meaningful story. Rafael Cassidy (Athena) did an amazing job. At such a young age to pull off such a performance is rarely seen, and given the right chances she could be worth to follow through her career. Clooney is good but not spectacular as his character is not great in the beginning. He catches up though. Britt Robertson (Casey) also does great and is another one to watch in the future.The story is actually very timely and is something i reflected on after watching the movie. It heads off with some background story before nicely introducing us to the characters. I was hooked all the way as we follow Casey around though thick and thin. Great movie and a bit low rated in my opinion. I would place it at 7.5 and therefore i give it the benefit of the limits with an 8.',\n",
       " 'It\\'s rare for me to walk into a theater and watch a film that I instantly love. Even more rare is when I get sucked into such a film, and loose my \"director\\'s eye\" that exposes every angle, cut, and page from the script within my own mind. However, if there was such a director who\\'s consistently done this, it\\'s Brad Bird. The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol are some of my favorites films of all time, and greatly inspired me as a filmmaker.Yet, none of the previously mentioned films add up to how I feel about Tomorrowland! It is one of those films you watch, and are never the same afterwords. It takes a rather happy weekend and makes it even better. It uplifts you when you didn\\'t realize that you were down, and perfectly stimulates your imagination! It enters your thoughts and will most likely be there, somewhere, in the back of your mind by the time you die. - It\\'s a film you\\'ll always remember.Perfectly blending Cyberpunk AND Steampunk to create a fictional world is no easy feat. I probably would have said it was impossible before seeing Tomorrowland, but, now, am convinced that the two sub-genres can perfectly work together in harmony! The visuals, jokes, pacing, action, and acting are all on par - a staple of Brad Bird\\'s films. While I could see how some may pass up this film if they aren\\'t ones for Back to the Future or The Rocketeer, everyone else will enjoy this film.I feel like this is almost an understatement, but, I put Tomorrowland as my 3rd favorite film of all time! It\\'s perfect, in every sense of the word - maintaining a realistic image, while not taking itself too seriously. Tomorrowland has it all. I\\'m already fairly certain it\\'ll be my favorite film of the year. I\\'d recommend that everyone go see it sometime. It doesn\\'t have the hype of something like James Cameron\\'s Avatar, but easily deserves it!',\n",
       " 'I will try to be simple:The good: Direction, original story, performance (especially the two young actresses), FX. A real jewel, and not only without a glitch, but with funny moments and action at every minute, or even, some of them, very touching.The bad: ... It\\'s supposed to need to write something? OK: nothing at all.The worst: All the bad appreciation of critics which really have no good taste for art. A lot of people does not understand that the movie is not just about Tomorrowland, but about a journey inside the heart and will of the people... and with this, as if that was a small achievement, an odyssey.If you want to see a good exponent of the 7th art, don\\'t hesitate to see this movie. If not, just listen some critics. ;)Additional comments: Some people say the movie has technical failures, but believe me, there are none, and the reason is because this movie returns to the most pure essence of Sci-Fi. Maybe some people does not liked because it touch sensible fibers about a very common and well known message, or maybe because they believe that it was only to promote a Disney attraction, but even if that was true, doesn\\'t diminish the quality of the movie. A little childish, OK, the movie was intended for all the audience, and this is not a bad thing, in fact, is an incredible and amazing way about how to show the essence of something really beautiful. Finally, I see some comments about an over-acted Britt Robertson, but if you have seen some of her works before, maybe you can see that the little histrionism that she injected in her character is very intentional, and then you will see the talent of this great actress.\"In a world where values, commitment, common sense, courage, curiosity, and thinking capacity are weakening, this movie is a beacon of hope for children... and adults too\".',\n",
       " \"I mean, don't be surprised. Yes, Tomorrowland is a science fiction adventure of the highest grade, an unpredictable thrill ride of a movie, full of plot twists, jaw-dropping imagery, hauntingly beautiful music, and brilliant acting by major star power. Not to mention the great direction and editing that does not leave a spare second throughout its two hour length. Disney, ILM and Pixar. Lindelof and Bird. Clooney and Laurie, Robertson and Cassidy. Wood and Murch. Giacchino. Rule-breaking and ingenious, inspiring and fresh, this is a top notch entertainment from a top notch talent. But it is more than all that. It is also a fable, a tale of two wolves. It makes its moral pretty clear.The thing is, people a fable is addressed to usually do not find it funny or cute. I wonder how many 'dumb', 'disappointing', 'preachy', 'pointless', 'boring', 'leftist propaganda', 'I fell asleep right when the Grasshopper...' Aesop was getting in his time. That is why Tomorrowland was a very brave thing to do. It takes guts to make a movie where everything from start to finish very smartly, very carefully, very distinctly adds up to the core message 'negativity is a failure' -- and to release it in a world full of negative people. Wow. I get why they hate it. I can also see why Brad Bird skipped Star Wars to make it. Personally, I think it was worth it. Thanks, Brad!\",\n",
       " \"The story may not be overwhelmingly unpredictable, but nor is that the point. This is about Ana and Damon and the people around them--who they are and what they go through. The acting and direction is mostly strong, as is the attention to detail. The dialogue is smart and reasonably natural. While the production is generally solid, it sags notably in the make-up department--where the work ranges from good to perfunctory and outright incongruous. (A strange area for a reasonably high-profile production to flounder, these days.) The FX work is all right albeit very derivative--as is the soundtrack, which thankfully never slips into being overly bombastic or loud.When it comes to writing, the series definitely could have used a more coherent approach. The fact that there were twelve (12) different writers for this ten-episode run bleeds through and muddles the narrative. In some episodes (the sixth one in particular) trite, traileresque exposition overwhelms the otherwise stark and intimate narrative style, making for an awkward and ironically comic-like detour.As for the story's adherence to the original--well, which original? Daimon's inception was in the early seventies. Both he and his sister (who has a considerably smaller role in most of the comics) have been portrayed in various ways through the years. The '75-'77 run is vastly different to the later two, which in turn don't entirely align either (and that's not even getting into the disparate appearances the characters have made in other comics.) Marvel loves alternate universes, and this is an accomplished, more restrained and human version which I think works really well. (I admit, though--while I really like Austen's and Lemmon's portrayals, I would've preferred for the siblings to at least have been redheads. Also, that title sequence is just off.)If you like sombre, portentuous horror drama series with a focus on character interplay, this is probably for you. If you come in expecting Hollywood spectacular or a straightforward comic adaptation, you are going to be sorely disappointed.\",\n",
       " '\"Helstrom\" is your usual dull formulaic horror show from the US.There are a number of reasons I believe it doesn\\'t work. The first is it neglects to offer a horror \"pay off\" each episode. Series in a similar vein that work, like the 90\\'s classic \"Poltergeist: Legacy\", acknowledge that people expect a complete story each episode. Its aright to have a larger back story but there has to be a reward for 40-50 minutes of the viewers time. \"Supernatural\" gets this too and its a hit because of it.Which brings up the second point. Its emotionally constipated, lecturing and up tight. \"Supernatural\" balances the darker aspects of the show with lighthearted humour. This ones far too sombre and busy being serious to be anything else. Its woke nonsense makes matters even worse. Using aggravating, provoking, sexist terms, like \"mansplaining\", which quickly and effectively alienated this male viewer.Bland, predictable characterisations. The key characters are attractive, successful mavericks with a dark past. They are cool and trendy in their own way and any flaws they have, are easily explained away. Its such a dull, cliche laden, stereotype. There\\'s no real depth or effort in characterisations that I can see. They are like retail clothing models, ultimately they all look alike.A few saving graces include solid acting, reasonable settings and decent cinematography.The end results a show that looks polished and yet manages to deprive itself of the creative oxygen, that makes series cast in the same genre, a resounding success.4/10.',\n",
       " \"I saw the previews for this and thought this was going to be one of those slapstick stupid comedy movies (Superbad, Super Hero Movie). I came on IMDb and saw the rating and the reviews and I thought I'd reconsider after doing some research on this. I was very wrong with my initial assessment. Yes, there's some teen comedic elements to this movie, but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack, great fight scenes, acting was good, story was great and original. With a current IMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this, look's like I'm not alone on how I rated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her having a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of Natalie's role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you're into comic books, video games, in your teens/20's/30's and don't have a young kid, you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is killing people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad review because of that, do some research on a movie before you go see something that you think you won't like. I hate musicals and I'm not going to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here and complain that there was too much singing and dancing. It's clearly geared at a older teen/young adult audience and is rated R, what did you expect. In closing, one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.\",\n",
       " 'In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack of idea, \"Kick Ass\" bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations in it\\'s wake. You\\'re on this page because you think it\\'s gonna be good? Wrong. Or you\\'re here because you think it looks a decent or a good superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD wrong. Reason being, is \"Kick Ass\"doesn\\'t want to be good or above average, \"Kick Ass\" wants to be great and it has the balls to want to be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where we\\'ve already glimpsed Mark Millar\\'s signature style in \"Wanted\", but \"Kick Ass\" is all about the unexpected.Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to what Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems determined to honour the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies entertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies have done that but \"Kick Ass\" ain\\'t giving that up either. It\\'s script is razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of \"the burden of heroism\" crippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actions rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to know and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by keeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more you know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all relatable so we\\'re with Dave 100% of the way, it doesn\\'t just have to functional.The real visual joy of \"Kick Ass\" is it\\'s desire to keep it simple but not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things, instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. That\\'s why they exude coolness, despite Dave\\'s almost humdrum existence. This is the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to; not a guy from another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine almost straight out of Jackie Chan\\'s Hong Kong days stuns us in a way no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn\\'t zing and churns them into a finely balanced flawless brew.Did I mention it\\'s feel good? From it\\'s inspired use of music (again utterly relatable) right down to it\\'s outstanding score, like \"Get Carter\" for superheroes; I could say more but there\\'s surprises in store.In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any James Cameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his menacing and humorous turn as D\\'Amico, a career best. Christopher Mintz Plasse follows \"Role Models\" by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolised Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movie she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she\\'s in, no easy task considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job of all. Being an original uber-geek after Michael Cera set the standard (anyone who\\'s seen \"Zombieland\" knows it\\'s hard to write an original geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it and OWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast where even the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. It\\'s quite an ensemble. A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one and complementing the film\\'s fun style.Watching \"Kick Ass\" is ultimately like being on a thrill-ride, it doesn\\'t just want to dazzle you, it\\'s wants to draw you in, ride the wave and leave the cinema on a high. And it doesn\\'t do that with gimmicks or tried and tested formula\\'s, it breaks the mold, shakes conventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all the movies you already love. It\\'s not just a movie, it\\'s a standard, one that promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heart and brain.And ultimately you\\'ll be leaving the screen thinking \"Wow, let\\'s do that again\" no matter how many agains come before it.',\n",
       " 'Kick-ass tells the story of Dave, a common teenager without anything special about him. Through his sense of justice and some events he decides to become a \"Superhero\" and hardly tries to save innocent people.Why did I like this movie so much? Well, that\\'s not easy to explain. The acting was flawless (in my opinion) with Aaron (Dave/Kick-ass), Chloe (Hit-girl) and Christopher (Chris/Red Mist) giving their best and shining throughout the entire movie. The storyline, even though it may not be the most original one, is amazingly well developed. The movie goes by at a perfect rhythm, combining comedy with action just perfectly. The music was amazingly well picked and combined 100% with every scene. and so on and so forth...When I left the theater I was so excited, so happy and so energetic, it looked like I just had a shot of adrenaline! And I couldn\\'t stop talking about the movie. It\\'s been a really long time since I felt this way about a movie.Now I know this movie is going to feed a lot of haters. It\\'s normal. A lot of people walk into the theater with their mind already set, like \"This movie is for nerds. It\\'s going to suck so much.\", if you have that kind of mentality just save yourself the time and don\\'t watch it. Why bother if throughout the whole movie you\\'re just going to be looking for flaws or rolling your eyes at every joke.I loved this movie. I don\\'t care about anything other people say.

The main character Kick-Ass is both comedic, quirky, and relatable (weather to yourself or someone you know) to anyone who's ever been to high school. His friends, also comedic, also will remind any guy of their own little group of three musketeers talking about movies, sports, comics and of coarse girls. The other heroes, such as Hit-Girl (who alone could provides the R rating) and Big-Daddy act as a total sub plot to the film that eventually mashes together with Kick-ass's story. They provide the majority of the REAL ASS KICKING. Also the characters actually get so connected with you that by the end you will actually feel and sympathize with the obstacles and tragedies they have to go through. Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching moments in this film.In all, this movie rocked, it's not for kids, it'll blow your mind, the filming technique was great props to the director, the acting was good, the action was sweet, and the movie in total kicked some SERIOUS ASS!!!\",\n",
       " 'I do remember hearing about KICK ASS on its release but for some inexplicable reason never got round to watching it until it was shown on Channel 4 tonight . I do recall it caused a bit of a stir along the lines of being a little bit violent but hey vigilante wannabes giving a few slaps to bad guys means we\\'re not watching Walt Disney but did have the impression it was going to be a good natured movie that possibly the whole family could enjoy . I have totally embarrassed myself typing that last line and should have listened to the channel 4 announcer warn of violence , strong language and scenes some viewers might find offensive What we have is John Woo meets Quintan Tarantino meets Hollywood obsession with comic book heroes and this isn\\'t really a criticism but it does indicate that this is certainly not the family friendly fare I thought I might have been watching . It does have a good natured premise ripe for all types of dark humour where Dave Lizewski a gauche New York teenager suffering from existentialist angst decides he\\'s had enough of being a nobody and decides to take on the criminal underworld as \" Kick Ass \" a real life superhero who is going to live up to his nameThis is how the early parts of the film play out and is blackly comical as Kick Ass has a quixotic plan to clean up the streets . Try and think of TAXI DRIVER where Scorsese cast a happy clappy Christian youth as Travis Bickle and you\\'re on the right tracks . The amusing tone of the film then changes as we\\'re introduced to Hit Girl a pre-pubescent child who spends much of the film dispatching bad guys in a variety of graphic ways . Let\\'s be honest here if she was in her early 20s and played by Megan Fox no one would have blinked an eyelid and if we were to be even more honest she\\'d be some sort of masturbatory fantasy figure but because the character is eleven years old that changes the whole game and watching Hit Girl jump around in the style of THE MATRIX literally slicing and dicing gangsters does make for uncomfortable viewing and some cynics might say she is included to stir up controversy Matthew Vaughn proves himself as one of the most interesting directors and if you want to say that he\\'s more style than substance then I won\\'t disagree with you but will defend him on the grounds that if you\\'re this talented when it comes to style who needs any substance . Like his earlier film LAYER CAKE there\\'s a danger of the whole film collapsing in to one big bad mess but is directed with such directorial flourish this never happens . He does help his cause by including a great soundtrack and might be seen as a cheap trick but is very effective KICK ASS is a very enjoyable film for those in the mood for some stylish designer violence but I should emphasise it is a violent film and the fact that much of the violence is tongue in cheek might ironically alienate audience members more than it might have done if everything had been played in a slightly more serious way , but there\\'s an energy here rarely seen in other films featuring vigilantes and superheroes',\n",
       " \"I'm really starting to loose faith in the American audience. While the premise of this film is very promising, this movie is absolute garbage. Kick Ass fails because the movie doesn't know what it wants to to be. Is it supposed to be a comedy with action, or an action movie with comedy? The answer to that question, however, is that it is neither. The movie fails because it tries to be both and ends up ruining the basic elements of either genre. The parts that were supposed to be cool were mixed in with comedy that completely resets the tone. I'm not saying that action movies cannot have funny parts, but the way in which this movie does it is all wrong. I can say so many bad things about this movie, but then I would end up writing a book. I'll leave it at this. Kick Ass is not only overrated, but it is also complete garbage. While watching this movie, I never found myself laughing because it felt almost out of place to laugh. If this film was meant to be a comedy, then I say that it took itself way too seriously. And if this movies was supposed to be an action movie, then it ruined all the cool stuff by adding humor at the worst possible moments. It makes me mad that people actually like this film. I believe in giving credit where credit is due, but this movie definitely does not deserve the critical acclaim that it's getting.\",\n",
       " \"Either we live in the world where a skillful marketing can make everyone's mind about the movie and sell it or... I don't know! With quite interesting idea in its sleeve (a kid with no power becomes a 'superhero') the movie turns out to be a complete disaster. It's repetitive, boring, not that funny at all, has no likable characters (just psychos, dumb teens and even more dumb and psychotic 'villains') and is completely inconsistent in its form. The idea is to put lots of typical clichés from different genres (teen comedies like American Pie, buddy movies, bloody revenge movies) and rip-offs from other comic-books (Batman, Spiderman, Punisher and even Iron Man) and put everything into a bag of movie sh.. as the main focus is to pack the sliced and incoherent story with never-ending bloody fight and torture scenes involving a kid stabbing, slicing and crushing people. Hit Girl is stealing the show, right!?It's like telling a 3-year-old to say 'F..k' and laughing because it sounds sooo funny. Then maybe he or she can kill a cat with a knife because you don't often see many 3-year-olds doing such a thing. The wise producers could do another popcorn flick set in primary school about kids killing Nazis and necrophiliacs. Sure they've never ever done that before! But should they! Is it really that funny for general audience nowadays? Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against violence in movies if it has SOME point to the story or even if it's nicely stylized (Sin City, 300). But in times of Saws the sickening violence has no other point apart from 'pleasing the audience' and Kick-Ass might be at the top of this statement. It can really make someone feel that comic books are worthless, pointless and derivative piece of crap that base their originality on pushing the boundaries in showing the violence rather than coming up with some decent storytelling. Kick Ass is as funny as interesting. Simply awful.\",\n",
       " 'I registered here to review this film, as I believe the high rating it has is a result of manipulation. I went to the cinema to see this after checking out the reviews here, and it has irreparrably damaged my confidence in IMDb. . . It is clear that the review system is being manipulated to give UTTER TRASH like this high ratings on IMDb. CHILD EXPLOITATIONI suppose if you\\'re a Hollywood producer backed by enough money to market your product, you can exploit children in your film. You can also assist in the progressive de-sensitization of the masses to violence and pretend to be provocative and original by getting your child actress to act out scenes of murder and extreme violence. You can do all this and still get rave reviews in the mainstream media , who are getting payed by your bosses, so who cares about human values anymore? People who find this film funny, or good in any way have some serious problems, in my opinion. This is like a bunch of retarded, coked-up teenagers with lots of cash to burn trying to be as awful as Tarantino in his worse moments. If you think this would be funny somehow, you are mistaken. This juvenile, onanistic sh!t is like the worse straight-to-DVD American trash you can pick up for a buck in junk stores. The facts : this film is marketed to young people; has received rave reviews and has not been utterly condemned for its abusive, criminal exploitation of the worse parts of human nature and Amerikanised trash \"culture\" . Pretty depressing, and this has lots to say about the hopelessness of our \"civilisation\". It\\'s funny if you have the humour of a sociopathic 13-year old boy from New Jersey. And it is precisely this demographic that should be kept away from films like this at all costs.Hollywood continues with its campaign to completely erode humane values and de-sensitize people to violence and torture. How come full-on sex scenes including genitals are taboo, but scenes of gory murder and torture are now so commonplace that even children can participate? How did we get here? Thugggish violence and shootings in schools by under-age psychopaths can be expected to continue with increased regularity thanks to films like this. Violence and torture are funny, yeah , as funny as a full-force baseball-bat hit to your genitals. Like another reviewer has said: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE',\n",

The production is very well made.What bothered me most were the convoluted plot points to keep the police away from the school during the shooting/siege. (not really spoilers, these happen in like the first 10-15 minutes of the movie) A field fire? A shed fire? Are those really going to get all the police and emergency response teams in the county to respond to those? And block roads because on lookers want to see what's going on?I've lived in rural places before. A field fire isn't going to get that many people to block roads to watch it. And we know early on one of the student's mothers called the police. But they couldn't tear themselves away from a field fire or a shed fire to respond to a school shooting.Weak plot points like this really ruin movies like this for me. If the kid had planted bombs at the court house or other important buildings in town, then we may have had a more believable plot point. But I am fairly confident they'd just let the shed burn to the ground if student lives were at risk, and a single engine fire response could have taken care of the field fire.Still, a pretty decent movie.

(I lied about the lady doctor thing, the mere thought of it makes me uncomfortable.)Sure, its can be a little too intellectual for some; a little bit pretentious and some could argue, conceptually grandiose.But so what?Road house in essence is an artistic masterpiece, and as with all good art, it stakes you down and rakes your psyche over the hot coals of morality and dares you to ask the hard questions.Questions like:\\nWhats the deal with society, am I right?\\nWhere are all the black people in this movie?\\nWhy havent I spent more time on a lake practising shirtless oiled up Tai Chi to enhance my street fighting abilities?\\nDamn, why Swayze smoke so much?Road House is cinema at its finest, raw, edgy and technically magnificent, all factors which culminate in it\\'s unarguable pride of place in the zeitgeist, and in the hearts of people who still have fake fights with imaginary baddies in the shower with super realistic noise effects and oscar worthy dialogue.12/5 80\\'s boobs',\n",
       " 'So what kind of film do you get when you have great one liners, bar fights, guns, knives, egos, strippers, blues music, a polar bear and a monster truck? You get one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of the late 80\\'s, Road House. The film follows James Dalton (Patrick Swayze) a cooler (bouncer) and the best in the business, as he takes employment with Frank Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) the owner of the Double Deuce in Jasper, Missouri. The bar is the roughest in town and he needs Dalton to clean it up. However corrupt business man and crime boss Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) stands in his way. After the classic \"chick flick\" Dirty Dancing, Patrick Swayze was Hollywood gold. Women loved him and men wanted to be him. The film was full of romance. Then along came Road House, a complete opposite to Dirty Dancing, a little romance and loads of action. The film has a great cast including Patrick Swayze, Kevin Tighe, Ben Gazzara, Kelly Lynch, Marshall R. Teague, Red West, Kathleen Wilhoite, John William Young, John Doe, Kurt James Stefka, Keith David & Terry Funk. The cast works well together and it is full of great performances. Naturally Patrick Swayze at the height of his career stands miles apart from the rest of the cast as Dalton. A character that can hurt you with his words just as much as his fists. Tragically, 20 years later Swayze had his life cut short by cancer. His death is still a major loss to the entertainment industry, but his legacy will live on in the great performances and memorable characters he played. The film also a features a great performance by the late great blues guitarist Jeff Healey as Cody. It\\'s the music in the film that goes a long way to achieving the right feel for the film. Everything works well from the characters, the music to the setting. Set in a rural area the scenery is breath-taking and it is used to great effect. But it\\'s the fight choreography that stands out from many other films. Great bar fights are pretty much a thing of the past, but here they are full of action and humour just like the classic westerns. The one on one fights are brutal, mainly for the realism they portray. The script is awesome and full of classic lines mainly from Dalton and although many are cheesy, when he says it, it feels right. The director surprisingly hasn\\'t made many films but the ones I have seen of his I really like and I know I am in the minority. See my review of Gladiator (1992) for more by this director. This is truly a great film, although very underrated. It is also one of my personal all-time favourites. There are a couple of versions of this so ensure that you see the USA or UK version released after 2002 as these are the uncut editions. So grab a few beers and a few friends, but this on a big screen and turn the sound way up for a really great movie experience.10 out of 10',\n",
       " 'This movie is a masterpiece, a throwback to the \"Walking Tall\" and \"Billy Jack\" era of cinema... the trailer-trash drive-in cinema that Joe Bob Briggs waxes poetic about.For those of you in the unaware, Patrick Swayze IS Dalton, the bouncer of bouncers, who studied at the \"cooler\" school of bouncing run by Yoda... er I mean Wade Garrett, played to perfection by the King of Cool, Sam Elliott.Dalton is no ordinary bouncer.  He holds a PhD in philosophy, from NYU of all places, and considers himself \"lucky\" to hold such an esteemed position in the socio-economic ladder of life.\"Road House\" runs a fine balance between hilarious and unintentionally hilarious, and this is what makes it so entertaining.  I could go on and on about all the things that makes this movie so entertaining, but the hands down most entertaining part would be the mano y mano fight to the death between Dalton and Jimmy... where Jimmy says what has to be one of the most classic lines ever spoken in filmdom.  I won\\'t ruin it for you, though.',\n",
       " 'this is an amazing movie.  i have never enjoyed a moviegoing experience more than when i watched \"road house,\" and i say that with complete honesty.  this is not to say that \"road house\" is a good movie; it\\'s truly awful.  c\\'mon, it\\'s got patrick swayze as the lead character! the man cannot act!  his performances are wooden enough to deserve a layer of wood varnish!  however, this movie is a blast.  patrick goes to a town that is run by Mr. Evil (that\\'s not his name, but it might as well be).  Mr. Evil does nothing but mean things, just stopping short of eating children.  patrick is paid to go from town to town, teaching bouncers how to be bouncers.  of course, Mr. Evil and patrick cross swords and hijinks ensue.  it just goes to show you that everything good in life can be learned in a house.  on a road.this movie has it all.  random nudity?  check.  senseless violence? check.  painfully ridiculous dialogue?  triple check.  plus, it has a monster truck!  and there\\'s a bad guy who looks like the understudy for former wrestler lou albino!  and a blind man plays horrible versions of early 60s rock tunes, providing the sole soundtrack!  and a throat gets ripped out of an unarmed man\\'s neck in a fight scene!  and patrick swayze shows his naked buttocks off to a lady that isn\\'t even his romantic interest!  what more could you want in a movie?if you like laughing at how poorly movies can be made, this is one that will keep you from getting bored.  road house, i salute you!',\n",
       " \"This really is one of those guilty pleasures - a silly, inane movie, but possessed of so many elements for guys to enjoy, mainly regular bouts of ass-kicking, that a guy has to watch it about once a year to get his fix of adrenaline and a picture of how the world should work. The movie has its own rules and an internal structure mostly explained by the character of Dalton (Swayze), a supervisor of bouncers termed a Cooler. When certain entertainment establishments become too lowbrow and rowdy on a nightly basis, someone like Dalton is hired on to show all the patrons how to behave in a civilized manner. He has a degree in philosophy to help facilitate his instruction, plus some martial arts disciplines. In this world of bouncers, club owners, and alcohol dispensers, Dalton has a mighty rep - they've all heard of him, tho many thought he'd be bigger.Also with an older rep is Wade Garrett (Elliott), an aged cooler who shows up halfway in to help his protégé kick some teeth in. It's amusing to watch the bouncers when introduced to Wade - they react like actors introduced to the Marlon Brando of the bouncer industry. The main villain is a local rich bigshot (Gazzara), usually wearing a self-satisfied evil grin and nice clothes, hiding a repugnant nature which treasures power & more power above all else. Well, actually, he doesn't hide it much as the pic progresses. This is where such villains make a foolish error: if he'd been just a little more laid-back and content with all the power he already had, things would've probably stayed the same for him. But he just can't resist having total absolute control over everything & everyone - a pure-bred fascist if ever there was - offending the zen-like sensibilities of the usually serene Dalton. Of course, having a couple of Dalton's friends killed didn't help towards a peaceful resolution.The most entertaining portions of the pic are Dalton's methods in dealing with yahoo troublemakers; these dangerous dudes are reduced to clownish oafs by Dalton's effective tactics & knowhow. There's also a dark version of Dalton, Gazzara's main henchman, a martial arts master who seems a match for Dalton's prowess. There are frequent splashes of female nudity, including by Lynch as Dalton's new girlfriend (and doctor; Dalton isn't invulnerable - he needs a doctor about twice a week). You also seem to learn a lot about the art of being a bouncer, though some of this may be baloney. In many ways, this could be the perfect guy picture.\",\n",
       " \"First of all Iv just watched the movie a couple of hours ago and Iv just been reading a few reviews and I must have been watching a different movie to them cause I absolulty loved Venom!I love the relationship between Eddie and Venom, they proper cracked me up with some of the things they said and the whole room was laughing at loads of moments throughout the movie. Coming out of this movie makes me want to have a symbiote latch onto me if it's anything like the film. I loved the movie from end to finish, it was a hilarious, fun filled action ride!My only critic is I would have liked the finale to go on for a little longer but other than that I thought it was brilliant, I deffo reccomend everyone go see it.DONT Listen to other people's reviews, go watch it for yourself then decide if u liked it or not, I loved it!\",\n",

Though it did linger on for a tad bit too long.-The plot while amusing, is definitely lacking and drops the ball at least at a certain point, which i cant really dive into here due to spoilers. This certainly is the biggest problem with the movie. -CGI. Not great but certainly far from bad! -Venom. The symbiote is awesome and i loved the bonding with Tom Hardy's character which truly moved the movie forward. Definitely the strongest point within the movie and was eager for more!-Overall. Ignore the damn paid critics. They are a dying breed and shouldve been put out of their misery years ago. This movie is entertaining.

Can't think of anyone else who would be a better choice for the role but him.\\nIntroduction was really long, but I was not bored for a second. When Venom comes in his true form - the party starts! Wish few action scenes were less like Michael Bay's style (hardly see anything) but the inner child in me was really happy for Venom's maniacal kicking and punching around. Venom's character is really well made visually - his walking, jumping and smashing are just like in the comic books - thumbs up for that!Hope they will release R rated version on BluRay so we can see more of Venom's craziness. Tom Hardy allegedly said best parts are cut out to make the movie more age appropriate, and I think that's a shame. Anyway, I will watch this movie once more in cinema, and buy it on BluRay. After all, it's Venom!Go and see it on big screen - hope you won't be disappointed!Oh, and there are TWO mid-credit scenes - one we all are waiting for and another one that...just go and see it for yourself!\",\n",
       " \"What an incredibly average film.It takes no risks. It's watered down. It's generic. It's trying to give the impression it's following Deadpool down the R-Rated super hero route, but it didn't have the guts to go the whole way, or even take a step really.Tom Hardy is an OK Eddie Brock, but I still find him a bit hit and miss as an actor, and that comes through even from scene to scene here. Sometimes he just mumbles his way through with no effort and I genuinely wondered if he was channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, while other times he actually seemed to be trying, especially with the physical aspects. There's no connection or chemistry between Tom and Michelle Williams. I guess she was just hoping for some Marvel money and didn't realise this was a Sony picture. And the rest of the cast are incredibly average and forgettable. Especially Jenny Slate, who will always be stuck as Mona-Lisa from Parks & Rec.There's years of comic book lore and stories to draw on for Venom, but they ignore much of it... For example, why does Venom look like Spider-man? We know why from the comics, but in the movie it makes no mention of this, so we're left with questions and a very one dimensional character as a result.Of all the stories that could have been told about a symbiotic alien, and all the interesting directions they could have taken the story, they decide to go with what boils down to a boring buddy movie.\",\n",
       " 'Do have a fondness for superhero films. \\'Venom\\' also had talented people in the cast, Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams have both done great work in their careers, it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting anti-heroes in the superhero universe.Watched \\'Venom\\' with reasonably high expectations and with the willingness, as always, to judge the film for myself and form my own opinion. Was aware that it was not well liked by the critics, but part of me was really hoping to disagree with the thought that could a film with so much potential be worse than it actually looked? Have to agree with those that were left disappointed, while also not finding \\'Venom\\' to be that bad. Am not though going to join in the irritatingly excessive critic bashing from people who really need to start learning the difference between fact and opinion.\\'Venom\\' does have good things. It is at its best in the scenes and chemistry between Eddie and Venom, which had fun and tension. It is when Venom arrives on screen too when the film properly starts to generate interest, after too long struggling to invest in the first act. The darker elements of the film are actually quite well done, having a dark grit and creepiness. It looks reasonably good, well designed and shot with slickness and atmosphere.The music has pleasant moments and fits well while there is some exciting action, especially the car chase sequence. Some of the effects are terrific. Tom Hardy is intensely charismatic, with Eddie/Venom being interesting and well contrasted characters, far more believable than Topher Grace in \\'Spiderman 3\\'.However, the rest of the cast don\\'t fare so greatly. Michelle Williams has never had a flatter character than here and is basically wasted in a development-free plot-device role. Riz Ahmed is far too anaemic for the one-dimensional villain that\\'s both cartoonish and insipid. Of the characters, only Eddie and Venom engage and intrigue, the rest are flat. While some of the effects are terrific, others are terrible especially in the latter stages with the biggest offender being the rushed and clumsy climax.It is the script and story where \\'Venom\\' fails most. The script is really clunky, especially with the forced and goofy humour that can be misplaced (Venom\\'s disgust at taking the elevator was the one moment passing as funny) and the villain spouting dialogues and speeches that mean nothing. The less too about the soapy and cliché-ridden scenes featuring Hardy and Williams the better, they are bland and don\\'t serve much point, and the Life Institute scenes should have had more clarity. Unfortunately, these scenes dominate the first act and makes it feel rather dull and \"taking too long to get going\". The story is tonally disjointed, too many tones that are very variable on their own and don\\'t gel together, and very clunky. This is not a case of the film not trying, to me it came over as trying too hard in catering to everyone and throwing in too many ideas and elements and executing them very variably and too safely. For a story intended to be dark and violent, this seemed rather tame and held back.Summing up, a disappointment but not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox',\n",
       " \"Venom isn't a Marvel movie, for that it succeeds far more than if it had been. If you're getting tired of the Marvel formula then Venom is going to be a breath of fresh symbiotic air. Venom occupies it's own universe, it's dark, gritty and more grown up compared to its counterparts. The existence of Eddie's personal life feels real, his struggles are far more relatable than any other character portrayed in a comic book movie so far. He is an everyday guy who screws up and because of that his need to redeem himself gets him attached to a symbiote. After that hes just trying to stay alive until the very end when the truth of his circumstance means he is the only one who can prevent humanities destruction. The movie didnt lead up to this, it wasnt even known what was to come until the last 20 minutes of the movie.This is a marriage of two separate movies and it's done very well. You remove Venom and the movie feels like it could stand on it's own with a few key changes. The Venom portion hits all the notes required for a superhero movie. You actually care about Eddy and it's not because they give some sappy back story about loss or self reflection. You care because you can actually relate with what happens to him and how you may have reacted in the same scenario. He wasnt rich, a god or born with powers, didnt live with super advanced technology or volunteer for an experiment. Hes just a guy with a 9-5 in a regular relationship and living in the same world where shake downs and homelessness exist.The critics wanted a different movie then what they got. They wanted a basic Marvel super hero movie without realizing one of the better super hero movies as of late (Logan) didnt follow that formula either.Venom is the movie that stands on its own by creating a story with elements suited to the character, not checkboxes like others. Its entertaining and feels like it could have lasted longer. I'd rather feel left wanting then feeling like the movie is now requiring me to continue watching it because it's been dragged out too long.I'd rather watch another Venom movie then any other marvel universe sequel at this point.\",\n",
       " 'Luc Besson\\'s movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.',\n",
       " 'Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - \"It\\'s not realism, it\\'s not naturalism - it\\'s heightened reality\" as Gary Oldman very well put it.\\nIn \"The making of The Professional\" Besson says \"If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think \"It\\'s in me, I\\'m a beast!\" On this part we can\\'t forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments\". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion  in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda\\'s nose or Stansfield\\'s unforgettable \"EVERYONE!\" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman\\'s heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda\\'s father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don\\'t be fooled -  just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don\\'t see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: \"everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid\" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in \"real life\"? I don\\'t know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there\\'s the sensuality. It\\'s hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It\\'s not sick and it\\'s not degrading: it\\'s art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It\\'s a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don\\'t be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.',\n",
       " 'An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.This idea continues in Léon. Léon was Besson\\'s first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and Léon are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.I always found that until obtaining the \"Version Integral\" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an \"offending\" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.And so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson\\'s films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson\\'s style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno\\'s and by far Natalie Portman\\'s best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.Stylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson\\'s work. Characters are larger than life. Décors are in excess of realism. Besson\\'s characters lack psychological depth. \"The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar.\" Besson\\'s use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson\\'s work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"La Cité des Enfants perdu\". If you like French Cinema or consider yourself a cinephile you must see the latter.',\n",
       " \"I went into this movie completely excited. And I wasn't even really disappointed either. The acting was very good, and I actually loved how they didn't follow the exact storyline. They took the basics of the original Dawn of the Dead and made it more contemporary. I knew they wouldn't be filming the movie at Monroeville Mall (the mall just 15 minutes outside of Pittsburgh where they filmed the original) but it was still awesome none the less. The script worked rather well, and the movie flowed nicely also. Granted I wasn't a huge fan of the fast moving zombies, but I suppose I can let that go because truthfully, maybe before rigor mortis sets in, you'd be able to move quickly, who knows? But I do know that I was on the edge of my seat through many parts of the movie, and you start to really care about the characters in the movie. I am anxiously waiting for 1 week to pass so that I can get my copy of Dawn. I already have it pre purchased.8/10 rating. The movie missed a perfect 10 for the simple fact that zombies SHOULD NOT run that fast.\",\n",

After watching it this weekend, I just had to add a footnote about this version of the film. IT MAKES A GREAT FILM EVEN BETTER.Comments from other reviewers have sometimes made reference to a lack of character development in the film. The UDC version restores this kind of content, and is one way that the UDC version improves on the theatrical release. I see better character development in this version of dotd-2004 then in the (1978) original version of Dawn.The other improvement the UDC version makes is to restore some really excellent gore shots. If you\\'re into that thing, of course. And if you\\'re not - well of course you\\'re into it - that\\'s why you\\'re checking out this film!',\n",
       " 'As a HUGE fan of the original Dawn of the Dead I was very skeptical of this remake.  I wasn\\'t expecting an Academy Award winning blockbuster or anything, but I did want to see the remake do the original justice.  I was impressed with the filming more than anything.  This is an action movie rather than horror.  The outdoor scenes are filmed with a grainy, hand-held camera which gave the audience the feeling of being disoriented much the same way the characters would have felt.  The movie was not made in the MTV-generation style that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was.  Dawn of the Dead stuck to the same mythology of the first without giving it a complete reimagining.  I could imagine the two movies co-existing, but in different parts of the world.One of the key differences that I did like was the idea of the zombies running.  This made them come across as more menacing rather than being the slow clunkers that are seen in the original trilogy.  The idea of being able to walk right past them was abandoned.  I also feel that the movie did a good job of showing how quickly people would turn on one another and watch out for themselves only.One of my favorite \"realisms\" of the movie is how the characters are too attached to their loved ones to shot them when they become zombies.  I\\'m certain that many of us would react in the same manner if something like this were to actually happen (yes, I know it\\'s impossible).  Also, it was interesting to have so many people make it to the mall instead of only four as in the original.  Of course some of these characters fit the generic stereotype of a movie such as this, but I\\'m not surprised considering modern audiences would need such characters to maintain their interest.  This was a movie made for film viewers, not film makers.  We have the strong and silent male hero, the quick-thinking blond heroine, the official dumb jerk, the official slut, the young and naive girl who loses everything and needs the group\\'s protection, the angry challenger for group leadership who has a change of heart and becomes heroic, the young trainee who disagrees with the angry challenger yet follows due to a sense of duty, and the stupid follower who gets his comeuppence.One aspect that was missing from this remake was the original movie\\'s social commentary on the commercialism of people.  Ken Foree\\'s character of Peter mentioned this in the original whereas Ving Rhames\\' Kenneth was more of a silent action hero never having much to say.  This was another reason that I saw this as a simple action movie -- though I will say that Rhames has more acting ability than Governor Schwarzenegger, Sly, Seagal and Van Damme combined.  Rhames also LOOKS like an action hero rather than today\\'s prettyboy \"action heroes\" such as Tom Cruise, Ben Affleck, Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves -- who all look like they couldn\\'t fight their way out of a cooking class for senior citizens.All in all this movie was not better than the original and won\\'t be nominated for any Academy Awards, but if you\\'re looking for entertainment and can stomach the blood it\\'s worth checking out.  I can\\'t wait to buy it on DVD someday.',\n",
       " \"How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.The movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.Seeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.The plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on cliché themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.As Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.First time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.The horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.All to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'However, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.It's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.It's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.Good acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.\",\n",
       " \"The Dawn of the Dead remake would have to be one of my favorite remakes because it is very chaotic, I love the carnage and the film's premises lie on disturbance.At many moments I found the film very, very disturbing. Zack Synder had really put a lot of effort into the remake. his remake also starts off on some happy little slope and then when we see the girl who's a zombie, then we all know that it's gonna get better from there.I like how Zack keeps the film's plot on the exact same story line where there are many survivors trapped in a Mall and that there are Zombies trying to get in. It was great to see that the elements of this great adaptation can be compared to George A. Romero's classic so well.I also like how there were more survivors this time round and it was excellent to see that we could all see what each survivor was going through. Some where determined to get out of this mess, some where stubborn and one was just an idiot. But it was great to have a variety of smart and dumb-witted characters.There were also many sad moments in this film that really left me disturbed and I'm not going to spoil it.Overall it doesn't fall short off of Romero's Classic Dawn of the Dead, having a chaotic situation, fast zombies, different varieties of characteristics & tones of weapons. It is my second favorite Remake and anyone who hasn't seen it yet, see it... 8/10\",\n",
       " '\"Dawn of the Dead\" is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978, which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic, \"Night of the Living Dead.\" This new version, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder, follows the original storyline fairly closely, centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesh-eating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.The original, in addition to being a horror film, was also a playful little satire on the consumerism in modern society. This version shucks this dimension entirely in favor of a straight-ahead horror approach. It may seem impossible for someone to actually \"dumb down\" a horror film, but Gunn and Snyder have managed to do that here. For this reason, the most famous and imaginative images from the first film - that of the undead wandering through the mall, vacantly interacting with the clothing and other paraphernalia contained therein, just as they did in their previous lives - are nowhere to be found in this edition. The other major difference between this and the original is that the zombies themselves are no longer restricted to a lumbering pace but can actually outrun the people they are pursuing. Although, theoretically, this should increase their terror potential, it actually winds up diminishing it somewhat because it robs them of that otherworldly creepiness that made them so scary in the earlier movie.Nevertheless, this remake turns out to be a fairly effective cannibal zombie movie even if it doesn\\'t rise to the level of the original. There\\'s a nice apocalyptic feel to much of the earlier portions of the film, and the screenplay allows for a reasonable bit of character development within the rather limited framework of the genre. There\\'s even a very subtle homage to the great \"Carnival of Souls,\" the far more gentle precursor to all these over-the-top zombie pictures, when a character describes himself as a church organist who sees his \"calling\" as \"just a job.\" Although the film isn\\'t really all that scary, \"Dawn of the Dead\" provides just enough tension and chills to make it worth seeing for any true horror film aficionado.',\n",
       " \"I just got back from seeing this film, and I am so revolted by it. I've been a big fan of zombie flicks from the past, especially the romero and fulci flicks and this movie just saddens me. All I could think was rip off of 28 days later, and ruining of the original dawn of the dead. Heck, the movie starts in a hospital, leads into a dramatic loneliness seen, then the alarm clock imagery followed up by riot footage and a red on black title sequence so similar to 28 days later - oh and not to mention they sped up the film half way through, and of course magically all the zombies were fast paced atheletes - even a bloated obese woman, it made me feel bad knowing this movie was made in a america with a much more bloated budget than that of 28 days later, a movie that I feel made some steps forward in a genre that hasn't hardly been improved on since the early 80s. This movie also consists of a ton of plot holes and loose ends. Ridiculous. Absolutely. Now the group of friends I saw it with said it was OK as a gore film, but being a zombie fan and recognizing whats been done and why made this movie falter so badly. There's a million one-liners, some funny scares, a couple tributes to the classics (cameo by savini, head zombie, baby zombie, etc.), but it doesn't really do them any justice with the film as a whole. I say, if you're a zombie movie fan and you don't want to waste the eight bucks I just wasted, wait for it to come out on video, maybe there'll be a good movie in the special features on the dvd, who knows. But yeah, terribly unoriginal, and arrogant.\",\n",
       " \"I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers, no TV spots, no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is, moving at a neck-breaking pace and not letting up on the gut-wrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed, something damn rare for a remake.While many remakes are easy, pointless cash-ins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans, DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart, it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.Young Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) is living the suburban dream: perfect house, loving husband, well-manicured cul-de-sac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight, her life is changed forever (as anyone's life can) when a lethal virus, that causes the dead to come back to life, spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly, completely, hopelessly outnumbered, Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery (as so many, many other reviewers have) and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.First of all, the zombies (the word is never mentioned in the film) can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them, no hate, no prejudice, and no grudges. They exist only to create more, as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life, for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent, ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters (more zombie nosh!) boarded up in the mall: cop, nurse, hoodlum, survivalist old lady, pregnant woman, security guards, gay guy, arrogant playboy millionaire, pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original (DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reporters-the very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of crises-chickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves) but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive, despite differences, that the original didn't have.The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20-something teen soap-opera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However, there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardises the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.There are a few references to the original (I'd hate to call them 'in-jokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature) that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.Writer James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the 'fast zombie' type seen in this movie and (the absolutely awful) 28 Days Later. But they are far, far, FAR more terrifying than the slow, sluggish, rigger-mortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you, ripping you're throat out before you can say 'crikey!' Yes, the 'turning times' vary wildly in the movie, but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie, but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this, though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.This new Directors Cut DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore, bridging scenes, more character development, more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.Filmed in Super-35 the DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. A truckload of extras include Commentary by director Zack Snyder and Producer Eric Newman, The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed, Special Bulletin: We Interrupt This Program!-complete news coverage of the attacks, deleted scenes, Raising the Dead and Attack of the Living Dead featurettes and Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads.\",\n",
       " 'George Romero\\'s original \"Dawn of the Dead\" is a classic, hands down. It is a fine, thoughtful movie. The characters are carefully meshed out and developed over the course of the narrative, beyond that, Romero\\'s dramatic decisions make sense, he only uses four main characters to propel his story. The remake, on the other hand (one can only hope that Romero made some money from this, which would be the only justification), is a stock 00s Hollywood product: utterly soulless and moronic from the first frame to the last. The characters are stereotypes and at times bizarre (armed security guards in a mall?), the action perfunctory and essentially pornographic in its lack of relation to the story itself. The screenwriter decides to toss in some smarmy, obnoxious characters straight out of a bad 1980s teen sex romp. Annoying, smart ass yuppie? Check. Hard ass rent a cop security guards/morons? Check. Useless characters who stand around for ten minutes acting surprised that the zombies that have been attacking them for the last few days are, in fact, attacking once again? Check. Characters are uniformly good shots (none of the tension in the first film from SWAT members vs. the macho but inexperienced helicopter pilot) able to adjust their aim and \"shoot \\'em in the head\". In the first film the characters planned and executed schemes to the best of their abilities, in this one a bunch of idiots run around like headless chickens flailing about wildly from one ill conceived plan to another. Thank you again, Hollywood, for doing your part to spoil a movie for young movie goers who will now make no attempt to see the original, since this remake is so \"totally awesome \\'cause like a zombie like gets totally stabbed in the head\". Its as if serious film goers have committed some grievous collective sin and are all being punished in some massive, communal private hell. At least Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini made a few bucks appearing in it.',\n",
       " \"I know, it is a shark movie. It is supposed to be cheesy and ridiculous. But I cannot help to hate this movie. Maybe because I had high expectations? Maybe because Jason Statham is one of my favorite actor?This movie is just predictable and full of cliche. The one liners that is supposed to make the audience laugh failed miserable and most of the time cringe worthy. The CGI is Sci-fi channel worthy at best. In addition, soon as I see a Chinese production company at its opening, I already had a bad feeling. The Chinese actors can't act for their lives especially the little girl.If you are reading this and you havent seen the movie, do yourself a favor and save two hours of your life. And yes, this is my first review, the movie sucks so much that it triggers me to make one.\",\n",
       " '16 reviews, and half are all a fake high-rated single review of this film - makes me shake my head why the producers think their viewers are dumb and wont see thru the fakes. All it takes is one click to see the only single review from the poster. Don\\'t get me started on the moronic review from halil-92019: \"Playing computer games makes kids smarter?\"This film had it\\'s moments, but it was nothing spectacular. The best parts were the cinematography, visuals and directing. The story itself has been done so many times, making the shark prehistoric doesn\\'t add anything to the imagination. The writers needed to up this a few levels and not rely on Statham (who was great as always) to bring in the moviegoers into the theater. The 103 min length felt a little long, but the pacing good enough to keep you interested, although it was missing that constant extra thrill and suspense I expected. Instead, I cringed at the cheesy 1 liners and poor attempt at humor - most executed at the wrong time.It\\'s an honest deserving score of only 6/10 from me.',\n",
       " \"I hate this film. Like really hate it. Firstly, I hate Jason Statham, with his husky breathy voice and boringly perfect physique. I hate the trope dot com billionaire, for oh so many reasons. I hate the Asian woman with her perfect hair and make-up and criminally neglectful parenting. I hate her child, as much as this film wants me to love her cutesiness. I hate the token black guy who, obviously, is loud and dramatic at all times. I hate Statham's ex-wife, because of course she looks like that. I hate the Asian woman's dad with his soppy monologues and general pointlessness. And I particularly hate the punky goth woman or whatever the hell she is with her stupid Gen X hairdo, starter pack tattoos and unnecessary Botox.I hate every single second of the dialogue, more so than in any other film I've ever watched. I hate the 'romance' between Statham and Asian woman. I hate the complete triviality of violent death. I hate the lack of wind at sea. I hate the lack of hypothermia suffered by the cast. I hate the Chinese people at the beach. I even hate Pippin, purely because these cretinous writers wanted me to love him. But most of all, I hate the fact that I live on the same planet as people who actually enjoy this movie. I hate them.\",\n",
       " \"I will be upfront with anyone who hasn't watched this yet. Mindset-wise if you go in thinking more along the lines of Deep Blue Sea rather than JAWS you'll probably have a good time. If you want serious, deep storylines and Oscar-caliber performances you probably should avoid it because this isn't it. Also on that note, why the hell would you go see this movie in the first place if you want that?This movie is just stupid fun with tons of funny moments. The comedy aspect of it actually caught me off guard. I expected a few funny moments here and there like most films of this ilk, but this is just straight up funny throughout. There are plenty of grandiose action sequences. A character you just flat out hate because he's such an atypical ass-hat and some beautiful CGI. The film itself is very well shot and I even had a hard time telling whether the FXs were practical or CGI in spots. They blended stuff together well. I thought the acting was solid for what this film is. It's about what I expected. Like anything, there were a few things here and there that could have been better. But, none of those things were enough to hinder my enjoyment of it. I personally would have liked to see it be a tad bit gorier. I think that might have pushed this up a notch especially with the type of story this. On the other hand, that's more of a preference than an actual hindrance type thing. This was exactly what I wanted out of a Summer Blockbuster style film. It's a fun theater-going experience. It's the type of movie you want to see on the big screen with a great sound system. What I would consider a perfect popcorn flick.My Rating: 7/10\",\n",
       " 'Dont listen to most of these reviews. The Meg is a steaming pile of hot garbage. First I want to address the Chinese influence in the room. If you like sub-par, nonsensical movies where China and Chinese things are shoehorned in as hard and as often as possible for no real reason, then this just might be the movie for you! If you want to watch several Chinese \"actors\" who cant act (Bingbing Li and Shuya Cai... God if you got used to seeing good child actors like those in Stranger Things are you in for a treat seeing this kid \"act\") in an unimpressive \"spectacle flick\" then this movie might be for you! If you\\'re a teen or sub-teen who thinks flicks like Paranormal Activity are good, then check this bad boy out! If you\\'re all of China, well you\\'ve probably already watched this.For real though, if you have a pulse and are not in a medically induced coma, dont waste precious brain cells on this! The Meg is an extraordinarily predictable, laughably bad (but not so bad its good) effects driven garbage movie with a pointless plot. It is the typical \"Chinese funding movie\" where you can clearly see the influence the investors had in regards to the movie. There really isnt a plot, which would have been fine if there was some character development but there is no character development either. Even the special effects were VERY meh and 2008 video game cut-scene feeling. The \"best\" thing about this movie was Jason Statham, but he had little to work with and even his acting felt... disappointed. I wouldnt say hes phoning it in, but he DEFINITELY is not giving his all. All of the other actors, including Rainn Wilson, were pretty awful. Unfortunately there are several long shot attempts for us to empathize or care about characters but when their acting is worse than a 1st grade play its hard to take seriously. And Bingbing Li... we get it, you\\'re a pretty face who probably did a LOT to get into the position you are now but you\\'re not a good Chinese actor and you\\'re a tremendously terrible actor in every western film that your bf paid for you to star as. Surprisingly Shuya Cai was even worse than Bingbing, but she at least has the excuse of age on her side. There is really only one thing going on in this film: Who is the Meg gonna kill? These kills are telegraphed that these people are going to die a mile away with crappy lines that are supposed to be foreshadowing but are HORRIBLE. Then comes the main star of the show, the Meg. It acts completely unrealistically as a natural predator. You know they just wanted it to act like a movie murderer, but they have it do so many stupid things that are out of character for an apex predator of the seas. It ignores abundant food sources, stays at or near the top of the ocean, and instead of going deep into the ocean and away from shore, somehow this super shark just KNOWS that there is a nearby Chinese beach brimming, and I mean BRIMMING, with swimmers several miles away. While that sounds like a good place for a super shark to go have a nom, there are vastly better, more plentiful fish in the sea than Chinese people on a beach. How and why it makes a bee line to that beach is a mystery of bad writing. The way they \\'take care\\' of the Meg at the end of the flick is probably one of the dumbest, lamest, so unlikely of a scenario that I let out a huge laugh. This has got to be the worst ending in a mainstream movie I\\'ve seen since I cant remember when! The whole thing was over China-fied that it almost felt like one long advertisement for China. That wouldnt have mattered if they made it part of the script for some reason but no, its Chinese for the sake of being Chinese so Chinese audiences can go OOOO CHINESE!3/10 for Statham and... well I couldnt really think of anything else. I was going to drop it to a 2 but I guess the effects bring it to a 3. However bad you might think it is, trust me its MUCH worse than that! IF!!!! you want a super dumb turn off your brain and watch pretty colors on the screen, then see if you can get through this sludge. Everyone else STAY AWAY!!!!!The worst part is that if the Chinese investors actually let filmmakers do their thing, I\\' sure someone could have made this unique or interesting... but its just not.',\n",
       " \"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made.\",\n",
       " \"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old.\",\n",
       " \"These days, calling something a B-Movie is almost like saying it gets a pass for being a poor film, and while I don't believe that, there are moments in the film Shadow in the Cloud that the filmmakers clearly wanted you to turn your brain off for. I've been a fan of Chloe Grace Moretz as an actress for many years. From her fun roles like Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass or her incredibly committed dramatic performance in Hugo, she showed that her range was capable of going much further. Not knowing anything about this movie, I banked on the lead actress and the premise being fun enough, but I think I got much more than I bargained for. Here's why this film was both great and terrible all at once.After sneaking on board a plane for mysterious reasons, Maude Garrett (Chloe Grace Moretz) will stop at nothing to protect her classified cargo. Taking place in a single area of the plane for the entirety of the first and second acts, Shadow in the Cloud held my attention very much. Where this film began to lose me was in the very, very over-the-top crew members she had to speak to throughout the film. The level of obnoxiousness was far too much for a movie like this and then the final act hit and it honestly became a completely different movie. It's been a while since I've seen a film switch gears as hard as this one did.Having just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, I'm trying to wrap my head around how they're even going to market this film to the average moviegoer. For the most part, it takes place in a single location, and when it leaves that location to become a completely different movie, it sort of ruins the shock value of the final act to actually include that stuff in a trailer. Having no idea what this movie was before going in, I must say that I went through numerous emotions throughout. From being invested in the drama in the first act to raising an eyebrow for where it's about to go, to being completely taken out of the movie by the ridiculously over-the-top finale, it's going to be very hard to recommend this one to anyone.Chloe Grace Moretz gives a damn good performance here, having about 95% of the movie to herself. By the third act, this movie just straight-up becomes a cartoon and I just thought to myself that she is far too good for a movie like this. Maybe the filmmakers knew exactly what movie they were making and knew that they wanted to create some schlock to close out the movie, but Shadow in the Cloud in turn just feels like a bunch of random ideas smashed into one film. I'm truly not sure who the audience for this film will be.In the end, it's very clear that writer/director Roseanne Liang set out to make some obvious messages throughout the movie, which is what I feel the whole film was going for, but I thought it was way too heavy-handed, especially for the popcorn movie it becomes by the end. The best thing I can say about this film is that the central performance is great and the film is never boring, as it's 83-minute run time does fly by. The problem is that this movie evolves into something that's just too much for itself to handle. I got a huge kick out of certain elements, which is enough for me to give the film a passing grade overall, but it's not a great movie by any means. There are things to have fun with, but the over-the-top nature is simply overdone.\",\n",
       " 'The log line is very intriguing:\\nA secret agent boards a B17 bomber with orders to deliver its secret cargo while flying through enemy territory in the Pacific.But the actual premise is a call to a classic Twilight Zone episode in which a monster (seen only by the protagonist) tears apart an airplane piece by piece while the crew is blissfully oblivious of its existence.All that is good enough and makes for an interesting first half of the movie. With most of the time spent watching Chloe Grace Moretz stuck in a ball turret hanging from the belly of the aircraft, bantering with the crew.In the second half of the movie however, everything falls apart. There is no more intrigue or tension. The movie becomes a strange mix of horror, thriller, war action, and family drama (yes, yes!). With no clear direction, other than placing the protagonist into progressively absurd scenarios.',\n",
       " \"What an absolute disgrace to the Watchman name.The comics and 2009 movie did such a fantastic job focusing on big picture issues, tackling the tense geopolitical climate during the Nixon administration, deep philosophies such as the meaning of life and the people's right to know vs. international peace.The HBO television show stripes away all that and instead focuses solely on race. The white supremacists have adopted the Rorschach mask as their symbol (which is incredibly misguided as that's not what he stood for), and the mask wearing police hunt down these white supremacists with a shoot first ask questions later mentality, using torture on suspects without batting an eye.No doubt supporters of the show will declare that haters are either too dumb to understand the show's little mysteries or are just plain racists if they dislike the show.If Hollywood wants to create a race-baiting radically liberal television show, by all means go for it, just please don't call it Watchmen. Add this to the unfortunate miss column for Alan Moore along with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\",\n",
       " 'TV-Watchmen fails in two ways that ought to be mutually exclusive; it can be hard to follow for those who haven\\'t read the original novel and know all the names/references by heart, but it also has little to do with Alan Moore\\'s source (especially by the start). Even when it does finally explain things to new viewers that old fans might understand immediately, e.g. the presence of a bizarre squid rain, it\\'s done briskly in a way that may befuddle newcomers but provide hollow fanservice for the old-timers, not that member berries excuse all the other key points missed by the show (early on, for instance, I didn\\'t feel that this was the same universe that famously deconstructed masked superheroes and made them pitiful).However, let\\'s ignore the fact that the very idea of a sequel to the comic book also ruins the openness of its ending, where the reader is permitted to look at Rorschach\\'s ever-changing inkblot mask and either see a champion of ultimate truth or an enemy of world peace; where Ozymandias (for some reason played here by Jeremy Irons) either successfully brought the nations together through his conspiracy, or failed when/if Rorschach\\'s journal was released.Let us simply accept the reality that someone wanted to do big-budget fanfic about what happened next in this alternate history and what became of the world after Ozymandias\\' masterstroke. What we can then ask questions about is why the show\\'s answer to the novel\\'s timely Cold War anxiety is to kinda-sorta adapt the AntiFa vs. white supremacist squabbling, why Rorschach would become a symbol of freedom/truth only for ethno-nationalists when his truth leaked (unless we buy that Moore sincerely thinks his best character was no more complex than a right-wing as***le), why the VFX used to bring this universe alive have gotten worse since Snyder\\'s attempt, or why the dialogue sounds like it is from a much dumber comic that isn\\'t as satirical about the ridiculousness of masked heroes.When I reviewed the first episode, this was one of my main complaints. We\\'re definitely meant to think it looks super cool when Tulsa officer Angela Abar (Regina King) dons the Sister Night habit and beats up men thrice her size, doing the work no regular Tulsa policemen will. However, I now feel like figures such as Looking Glass (Tim Blake Nelson) and Red Scare (Andrew Howard) shine a light on the more pathetic side of costumed heroes, the way Watchmen ought. Red also confirms that the show doesn\\'t kiss the derriere of every faction within the modern radical left, as geeks aplenty have feared.We also get Jean Smart as Laurie \"Silk Spectre II\" Blake, because I guess she eventually became okay with bearing The Comedian\\'s last name, and she apparently lusts after the vanished superman Dr. Manhattan after breaking up with Nite Owl. Don Johnson plays \"one of the good ones\" amongst white policemen but you can guess what sort of twist they build towards. Louis Gossett Jr. appears as a mysterious survivor of the Tulsa riots. Hong Chau portrays a character that seems to rival Ozymandias in terms of intelligence and creativity. As I said, Ozzy himself is played here by Jeremy Irons, and his increasingly outlandish subplot was more intriguing than anything taking place in Tulsa.Of course, there is always the issue of experiencing Watchmen within a set number of minutes. With the novel, you could spend as much time on a given page, going back and forth between the panels as you want, which is thematically significant when you consider how Dr. Manhattan experiences time (you can read the panels in any order you want, but the timeline remains preordained). For what it\\'s worth, the show has some clever ways of communicating how he perceives existence.I won\\'t reveal who eventually plays Manhattan or how they justify the casting, but it seems like another non-veiled middle finger to the perceived white supremacist fanbase. They do something similar with Hooded Justice and while making creative choices out of pure spite (especially toward white supremacists) is way up my alley, why co-opt the Watchmen IP for this?I guess it\\'s because Watchmen is loved by nerds, and nerds are supposedly prone to racism and sexism (especially if they dare not worship Captain Marvel and The Last Jedi, the monsters) but still. You can\\'t just say \"the book also had political allusions\" and decide that ergo it makes sense for the TV version to simply sneer at one side and pander to the other. If you aren\\'t gonna do justice its satire of the superhero or its distinct, purposeful visuals, can you at least give me its complexity and difficult questions? What am I even saying? It\\'s HBO.Still, did I enjoy the finale and how everyone and everything came together? I suppose. I just don\\'t know that I needed to wade through all of that cringe factor to get there.',\n",
       " \"Having really enjoyed/loved 'X Men: First Class' and 'Kick Ass' and being someone who likes a lot of the actors, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' did seem really intriguing.There was the intrepidation of whether it would balance the violence and humour well, whether the violence would feel too much or whether the humour would leave a bad taste in the mouth. Finally watching it, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was surprisingly brilliant. It sends up the spy genre (primarily James Bond), very like 'Kick Ass did with comic books, and does so brilliantly.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes that gives the film an almost operatic grandeur (like in the fight scene in the church), very cool gadgets, richly coloured lighting and audacious production design. The soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.Vaughn does a fine job directing here. Not just achieving the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing and the characters interesting, but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things like with the opening credits.The film's script is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar and very witty, with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny to hilarious moments. While the action is grim and unflinching (some of it is not for the faintest of hearts) but nail-biting and surprisingly dynamic, the fight scene in the church especially standing out. The story is very clever and absorbing, with incredibly energetic pacing without being too hectic or rushed. The film does deal with the twist well, it could easily have been out-of-place, clichéd or overly silly but it's actually a lot of fun with a touch of humanity injected.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' contains some very memorable characters, including a hench-woman with legs that can kill. It's very well acted too, three of the standouts being Colin Firth, cast against type but doing a phenomenal job (also doing incredibly well in the action), Taron Egerton as an immensely likable main lead and Samuel L. Jackson (though his performance has divided reviewers it seems and understandably), who is clearly having the time of his life as lisping megalomaniac villain Valentine. That is not to dispute Michael Caine, who is more than dependable as a somewhat ambiguous sort of character, and Mark Strong who has a knack of making even weak material interesting, or Sophie Cookson, very fetching though in a slightly underwritten role, and Sofia Boutella who nobody wants to mess with.If there is something that lets 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' down it is the ending with the anal sex. This was the one part of the film that to me came over as really unnecessary and tasteless, also seeming very out of place compared to the rest of the material and it is introduced randomly. The infamous Princess line is pretty offensively perverse as well.All in all, though, a surprisingly brilliant send up that does nearly everything right. 9/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",
       " \"Kingsman: The Secret Service marks the third film in a row that director Matthew Vaughn has adapted from a comic book background. His two predeceasing being Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011) - which, by all means, were pretty damn good!Over the last few decades, both comic and superhero movies, mostly fall into the easy trap of taking themselves too seriously. Where Vaughn's vision lies, and so-far proved by his former comic adapted films is that they draw a clean balance to where drama and serious character development ends, and cartoonish humour meets, leaving a unique entertainment that stands out.Based on the comic by Mark Millar (who also created Kick-Ass), the film sees a young – no better way to put it – chav, called Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), taken under the wing of Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a spy for her majesty's secret service. With the aid of Michael Caine and Mark Strong, they soon come face-to-face with the villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson); an ego- centric - Steve Jobs-type - billionaire madman (with a lisp), who hates the sight of blood – yet holds a vision of mass biological warfare.Licenced to thrill, Kingsman' is almost a love-letter to the James Bond films – but not too far as a parody, like Austin Powers - but more a homage to the franchise - a 007 meets Kick-Ass, of sorts. At a point, Colin Firth's character, Harry, even mocks the thought by saying 'give me a far-fetched, theoretical plot any day\\x85'Fans of Bond and Kick-Ass are certain to love it, as through rollercoasters of action, comedy and espionage, comes a bucket of winks, references and nods to the world of spy movies. Just like the colourful, gadget ridden Bond films of the 1960's, Kingsman is very fun to watch, with 'wham, bam, thank-you ma'am' style of mayhem, one- liners and bonkers soundtrack crazed all over it.The comic the film was based on was already hugely entertaining – in fact, probably the best we have read. Littered with Millar's creative quirkiness and with Vaughn's auteur film-making, has left a stylized-spectacle of ultra-violence.Portraying the lead character of 'Eggsy', Taron Egerton (also in this month's Testament of Youth), proves to be an outstanding newcomer as he brings the character to life with an energizing vibe of a comparing ethic of chav lifestyle vs. gentleman's class.Alongside, and tackling the mentor, come father type role, is Colin Firth, who based on previous filmography alone could easily be classed as Britain's most boring and typecast actor. Until now, the mold romantic films is broken as he picks up a gun and finds an encyclopedia of wit and enters openly new territory. It's Colin Firth like you have never seen before! – and it is bad-ass.Squeezing in with a 15 rating (somehow), Kingsman is never short of violence and its guts and guns galore, when kneecapping; slicing off body parts and explosions become all too familiar. Given the calibre of talent involved, Kingsman' does not fall stereotype and gimmicky like other YA spy adventures like Stormbreaker, or Spy Kids, but instead, a well-deserved mash-up of espionage and true cinematic excitement.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s strange when you consider it, how much the Spy thriller genre has changed and grown because of James Bond, there is not a single Spy movie that is made that isn\\'t and won\\'t be compared to double \\'O\\' seven himself. So I suppose it\\'s no surprise that a film like Kingsman had to be made eventually, so I suppose the reel question is will this make the Sky fall or just be a quantum of nonsense? Say what you like about Mathew Vaughn the man likes his comics. So far out of the 5 films he has directed, 3 were graphic novels first. Kingsman is one of them. The man\\'s like the anti-Zack Snyder, he directs films based off of comics and brings out real issues in them, as opposed to Snyder who directs films based off of graphic novels and ignores any merit or comment on the wider world the books make and just makes HIS movies. I\\'m happy to say that Kingsman is probably the most fun I will have in a cinema screen this year.As I\\'ve already said Spy films get compared to James Bond, so let\\'s begin with that shall we? Kingsman is a film that is both totally unique and its own movie whilst fully embracing its British heritage, the films marketing campaign drew strong comparisons to For Your Eyes Only artwork. The film acknowledges all of those stupid spy clichés in a way which is both knowing and clever, and then it ditches them all. The best example of this I can give is in the opening sequence of the film, there is a glass of whisky, a lot of people die and there isn\\'t a drop of said whiskey spilt, and at that moment Kingsman sticks two fingers up at the past and says \"we\\'re the future\" and from that second onwards Kingsman is its own movie. The film successfully reinvents just about every stereotype imaginable in a spy film. The villain, who is always central in a spy movie, is Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Valentine is a megalomaniac who wants world domination, all standard stuff so far, he also has a lisp and is terrified of blood. That\\'s the kind of thing Kingsman does really well, it sets us up with the standard and transforms it to be unique.The film is of course preposterous in the extreme, but I don\\'t care. It was funny, clever, brilliant and unique. Kingsman has so many pro\\'s to it that you can easily overlook the minor short comings, because in the end the film has a baddie who has blades for legs, I mean who doesn\\'t love that?What I like most about Kingsman is that even with all its madness it still manages to have some kind of heart; the entire movie is kind of a think piece on class war and the importance of legacy. The movie has a brain and a soul and it has no problem expressing either, the finale to the parachute problem proves this most for me. I would be remised if I didn\\'t mention something about the cast, let get over the whole \"the obvious people are amazing thing\" and look forward to the new comers Taron Egerton (playing \"Eggsy\") and Sophie Cookson (playing Roxy). These two talents have come from nowhere and broken through the glass ceiling, Cookson and Egerton are stars with one film to their names, and they deserve every single piece of praise that comes to them. Taron is such an unbelievably versatile young man, he can be funny, clever, cool, cocky, brash, physical, confident and insecure all without saying a word or moving a muscle. Also, I loved seeing Jack Davenport on screen again.Kingsman is the film this country needed; it\\'s confident and fun, without being disrespectful or full of nasty. In short, Sic.',\n",
       " \"Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a silly film, but it embraces that and, out of that, creates one of the most fun and entertaining action films yet.Part of the reason why I'm giving this film 10 stars is that it contains perhaps the greatest action sequence I've ever seen in any film. I'm still absolutely stunned by how the scene was executed, and I saw the film more than three months ago; I assure anyone that the action sequences are unlike anything they've ever seen before. The careful camera-work, the choreography, the high-octane music, EVERYTHING fits so well to create the ultimate violent action sequence. I mustn't spoil it.The other reasons I enjoyed the film follows: Colin Firth takes on the role as Harry Hart, a member of an international spy organization dedicated to protecting peace in the world. Firth takes on the role with enough seriousness and heart (Hart) to make the film engaging and fun. He steals every scene he is in, and his action sequences are the best ones in the film, but I'll get to that later.Newcomer Taron Egerton plays the new recruit Eggsy, a rebel with a lot of heart and dedication to his family and friends. Egerton makes him instantly likable as the lead and spawns the right emotions to help the audience almost instantly know his feelings and the tone of the film.The story overall is a typical formulaic spy plot, though Vaughn adds some more contemporary and ideological elements and twists (that have taken popularity with superhero films lately) into it to make the film more different and exciting from the stereotype James Bond films.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a roller coaster of a film, that seems to pick up and slow down at the perfect moments. The story is fun and dynamic, and the action is impeccable.\",\n",
       " \"I know that so many people says that Baywatch was the worst TV series of all, but everybody watched that, some episode at less.It was pure entertainment, that's all. And it was great to watch that show to have a fun time. Obviously, it could have never been nominated to a Golden Globe, I know, but think about it: it was the most seen TV series all over the world in the 90's. Why? Something was right in Baywatch, wasn't it? Not all seasons were so good, but for me the best were in the mid 90's. Two main reasons: PAMELA ANDERSON and YASMINE BLEETH. They were the stars of the show, never eclipsed by the other babes. Pam was explosive and a femme fatal (is she really retired). Yasmine was glamorous, beautiful and the best actress in the show. She was really talented (hope to see her on screen again after her coke hell).Of course many other stars were hot: Erika Eleniak, Carmen Electra, Nicole Eggert, David Charvet or David Chokachi. But Pam and Yasmine were the reasons why millions of people all over the world watched Baywatch. In fact, when they both left the show to go on with their careers beyond the beach, many people stopped to see the show. Poor Hasselhoff...Then, Baywatch Hawaii. I didn't like it. But Jason Brooks, Jason Momoa or Krista Allen were so hot.Finally, an unforgettable show, whatever you like or not. Baywatch was a world-wide phenomenon. And I hope to see Pam and Yasmine making cameos in the Dreamworks' Baywatch movie on 2006.\",\n",
       " \"So the writing wasn't of an A class standard, but the show last for over 10 seasons so you can't say that some people or should i say alot of people didn't like it or else it wouldn't have lasted that long. Here's just a summary of a few of the characters and why they made Baywatch so fun to watch and enjoy.David Hasselhoff (Mitch)- Right, he wasn't the greatest of actors and i'll be the first to admit it but David provided the show with alot of advertising and was the only character in the show's history to last all 9 seasons of Baywatch: California. Mitch brought the machoness to the show and he always put on stellar performances when they were needed.Pamela Anderson (CJ Parker)- Again not one of the best actresses but basically I think most of us know she was only really there for the eye candy, but CJ gave us some memorable moments on the show too especially when she struggled to find love through her years at Baywatch.\\nYasmine Bleeth (Caroline Holden)- She has to be one of the best actresses to ever grace the Baywatch shores, Caroline was the shy, seductive type who was always getting things wrong with her work and like CJ with her love life. Unlike Pamela, Yasmine wasn't afraid to take to the water.Alexandra Paul (Stephanie Holden)- Another good actress to grace the Baywatch shores and I think the only one to actually die, weird, but Stephanie's death was one of the best acted episodes from all characters.Gena Lee Nolin (Neely Capshaw)- One of the only hardcore bitches to come to baywatch and she was a real bad girls, sueing Matt Brody and forcing him to quit after false sexual harrasement charges, sleeping with Logan and manipulating him in front of Caroline, seducing Cody and tricking Mitch into marrying her. She provided the best entertainment on the show and always got her commupance.I could go through the rest but i'll not, but basically Baywatch provided us with some other great actors and actresses like Erika Eleniak, Nicole Eggert, Carmen Electra, Kelly Packard, Mitzi Kapture, Angelica Bridges and so many more.\",\n",
       " 'Baywatch, television\\'s most-famous \"jiggle series\" and by some counts the most-watched show around the world, did more for slow-motion beach joggers than anything since Chariots of Fire--just replace the British Olympic athletes with young women in high-cut red swimsuits who look like Playboy models. The premise of Baywatch is straightforward: a Los Angeles-based team of lifeguards saves swimmers and occasionally fights crime, led by beefcake Mitch Buchannon (David Hasselhoff). And those Playboy models? Erika Eleniak turned a 1989 magazine spread into a role as lifeguard Shauni McClain for two-plus seasons alongside Billy Warlock\\'s Eddie Kramer character (the actors themselves had a brief engagement), and most of the season\\'s action revolved around the lives and loves of Mitch, Shauni, and Eddie. (The most famous Baywatch babe, Pamela Anderson, would arrive the following season.) When they weren\\'t saving people on the beach, they were involved in movie shoots (\"Money, Honey\"), gang wars (\"Point of Attack\"), homeless girls (\"Sandcastles\") and stray pets (\"Thin or Die\"), a serious charge against Eddie (\"The Trophy\"), a Gilligan\\'s Island hallucination (\"Now, Sit Right Back and You\\'ll Hear a Tale\"), and chemical dumping (\"The Big Spill\"). Hasselhoff\\'s real-life wife, Pamela Bach, appears in a recurring role as reporter Kaye Morgan, Wendie Malick (Just Shoot Me, Dream On) has a small role as Mitch\\'s ex-wife, Gayle, and Tom McTigue plays lifeguard Harvey Miller.',\n",
       " 'For starters,I liked the first \"Baywatch\" series when it premiered on NBC-TV from 1989-1991,and from there when straight into syndication for the next 10 years(1991-2001)and this where the show ended up on one of TV Guide\\'s 10 worst TV shows of all time,and here\\'s why..........1. You have superstud David Hasselhoff(whom I liked as Michael on \"Knight Rider\"),and others plastic silicons which killed the series which spun off two installments(\"Baywatch Nights\" and \"Baywatch Hawaii\") under the production standards of Mr. Hasselhoff himself(whom serves as executive producer of the both spin offs as well as this series).2. ONLY on Baywatch could oceans filled with inept swimmers be watched over by lifeguards who ran in slow motion(and swam out to save them on the same formational shot).3. Not only it was an action packed show,but this sea-foam saga of a part soap opera of one-dimensional personalities with multidimensional bodies was,for a while,the world\\'s most popular show(not in my book it ain\\'t)which says more about the world than most of us care to know.4. The show made Hasselhoff an international status(which he rocketed \"Baywatch\" to the number #1 most watched show in several countries due to huge ratings overseas---but did you know its biggest audience was in Germany and Sweden?)and made stars of Yasmine Bleeth, Gena Lee Nolin,Erika Elenak,Alexandria Paul,Anna Smith(yes,Anna Nicole Smith)and the Queen of Junk TV,Pamela Anderson-Lee who acted as a human floation device during some of the episodes.For one,producers are trying their best to bring this back too...WHY?

       " \"After years of warning about global warning, Jack Hall is horrified to find all his predictions coming true much faster than he could have imagined. Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.This film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great \\x96 it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk \\x96 a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.The clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action \\x96 if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final \\x96 during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.The script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that \\x96 not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.Overall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours \\x96 bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.\",\n",
       " 'I was leery of a heavy propaganda piece on \"global warming,\" but I still saw this and found that, yeah that\\'s what it was but it was really more of just a straight adventure story than anything else.....and not a bad one, at that. The first 50 minutes of this two-hour film have the \"fun parts\" where the special-effects dominate. We see all kinds of radical weather disasters that are extremely dramatic and entertaining to watch, even if they don\\'t make a bit of sense.After the blizzard and sub-zero, unlivable weather conditions arrive the movie settles down to a young romance and survival story with Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Rossum and other people trapped in a library in New York City and Jake\\'s father, played by Dennis Quaid, walking all the way from Philadelphia to rescue him. Yes, it\\'s very, very far-fetched - the whole thing - but it\\'s a fun adventure story with nice people. It\\'s especially refreshing to see Hollywood portray a father as being so loving and selfless. The romance wasn\\'t overdone and the young people were not profane and/or annoying, as so often is the case.Except for the over-exaggerated and extremely erroneous scare tactics of this movie, and a ridiculous portrayal of the Vice Preseint of the United States, the movie works strictly as an entertaining fantasy-adventure story.',\n",

Welp, you best keep on looking because you won\\'t find those ingredients in \"The Day After Tomorrow.\"\\nThis is one of those movies where the entertainment value is in how much you can make fun of it. And believe me, Stephanie, Mr. Shade, and I poked fun at the movie for the entire two hours. What else can you do with a movie this ridiculous? I\\'ll admit the special effects are really good. The problem is that they\\'re used up in the first half of the movie. I was expecting a full 2 hours of action and chaos, but they got all that out of the way and the rest of the movie focuses on the characters and their attempts to survive.How cheesy is this movie? Let me count the ways...1) Gyllenhaal supposedly fails his math class because on his final exam he only wrote the answers. He did all the work in his head, you see. That\\'s just how much of a genius he is. So he and Quaid determine the teacher just failed him because he\\'s jealous. Um, when I was in school I had to show my work. Sorry to be the bad guy here, but it\\'s easy to see why the teacher might be suspicious. But this is a final exam, so wouldn\\'t this issue have been addressed earlier? Sigh. I thought for sure later in the movie Gyllenhaal was gonna save the world but he was gonna figure it out in his head so the movie wouldn\\'t have to explain to us how he did it. Thankfully, the movie didn\\'t get quite that extreme.2) This movie leads us to believe that a tornado warning cannot be issued until turning on the news and checking the weather report.3) You gotta love the overdramatic delivery of dialogue: \"Looks like a hurricane.\" *dramatic pause* \"Only hurricanes DON\\'T FORM OVER LAND!\"4) The temperature supposedly starts to drop 10 degrees per minute. Riiiiiiiight. So within an hour the temperature would be 600 degrees below zero? And as the temperature starts dropping, we see everything freezing. Particularly ridiculous is when Gyllenhaal and his buddies are in a library and we see the floor freezing and chasing after them. They manage to jump in a room and close the door JUST IN TIME! For some reason the door magically shields them from the cold. Whatever.5) Quaid and his friends are able to survive walking in sub-zero temperatures with little more than parkas and gloves. And they have these tents that apparently have magical warming powers because once in the tents they\\'re able to take off their gloves and hats and not be cold at all!I could go on, but I think you get it. Ohhh, and what was the point of Quaid walking all the way from D.C. to New York just to find his son? He knew his son was holed up in the library, and he didn\\'t show up with a rescue squad or anything to take him home. Oh yeah, he made a promise. Mr. Shade leaned over to me and said, \"If I ever promise you that I\\'ll meet you at the movie theater and the whole world freezes over, then don\\'t expect me to be there.\" Fair enough. It was obviously supposed to add an emotional element to the story, but it did nothing for me. Quaid should\\'ve just waited and taken a helicopter to New York after the storm died down. It would\\'ve been better than risking his and his partners\\' lives.I could write a thesis on the absurdity of the science used in the movie, but I won\\'t bore you. There are plenty of articles by climatologists you can read that state how the events in the movie are impossible, especially a glaciation of this magnitude occurring in three days and catching the ENTIRE WORLD by surprise. Folks, Memphis weathermen interrupt my regularly scheduled programming whenever a drop of rain is registered, so you better believe they\\'d be on top of this.Let me just add that this movie is based on the book, \"The Coming Global Superstorm\" by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. Strieber wrote another book called \"Communion,\" in which he claims he was told of the Earth\\'s upcoming apocalypse by aliens. If that\\'s who you wanna get your science from then go ahead. I hope you\\'ll excuse me while I point and laugh at you.I feel sorry for fringe groups who are actually using this movie to tout their political agenda. Saying this is a movie people should watch to prepare for a possible global warming catastrophe is about as legitimate as saying people should watch \"Dawn of the Dead\" to prepare for what would happen if zombies attacked. I\\'d say they\\'re on equal ground in regard to scientific accuracy. But I doubt too many moviegoers are gonna take this seriously.There\\'s so much more to make fun of, but I\\'m gonna stop myself. I was extremely disappointed in the movie, so there\\'s a good chance you will be also. This is the type of movie that shows a weatherman get hit by a huge billboard during the middle of the storm, and the only emotion it prompts is laughter. You\\'ve been warned.\"The Day After Tomorrow\" is the kind of movie that might have scared me when I was 6 years old and uneducated. Now I can\\'t help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. But hey, if you like movies with overwrought dialogue, a lame attempt at a love story, a severe lack of tension, no emotional pull (other than laughter), less believability than \"Independence Day,\" and one of the most anticlimactic endings I\\'ve ever seen in a Summer blockbuster, then this is the movie for you.Now if y\\'all will excuse me, I\\'m gonna head to the bathroom and take a Day After Tomorrow.',\n",

       " \"Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow is one of those textbook disaster flicks where every recognizable element is in full swing: determined scientist, sure of his curveball theories that no one else buys, saddled with a dysfunctional family and a clock that's quickly ticking down towards some looming cataclysm, in this case severely bat tempered weather. It's cliche after cliche, but this is one of the ones that works, and I have a theory why. These days it seems like the formula for the disaster film is pretty dead, or at least doesn't carry the same magic it did throughout the 90's and early 00's.Stuff like San Andreas, 2012, Geostorm (shudder) just feel dead on arrival, and instead we go back and revisit things like Armageddon, Independence Day, and for me, ones like this. There's a quality, a feel for time and place that got lost somewhere along the way as time passed in Hollywood, and this is one of the last few that serve as a milestone as to where that happened. The first half or so is cracking stuff, followed by a slightly underwhelming final act. Dennis Quaid is the scientist who gets all in a huff about an extreme weather front that's apparently barrelling towards the east coast, threatening to give the whole region one wet day in the park. There's an exaggerated halfwit Vice President (Kenneth Welsh) who scoffs at him, an excitable veteran professor (Bilbo Baggins) who eagerly supports him, and an estranged family right in the storm's crosshairs who he must rescue. The special effects are neat when the maelstrom slams into New York like a battering ram, pushing over buildings with walls of water and chucking hurricanes all about the place. Quaid's wife (Sela Ward) and wayward son (Jake Gyllenhaal) are of course stuck in this mess, as he races to find out what's causing it, and how to escape. The initial scenes where it arrives are big screen magic, especially when Gyllenhaal's girlfriend (Emmy Rossum) is chased down main street by a raging typhoon and barely scapes into a building, a breathless showcase moment for the film. The second half where the storm levels off isn't as engaging, despite attempts to throw in extra excitement, such as wolves, which I still can't quite figure out the origin of, despite watching the film a few times now. Holed up inside a library, it's a long waiting game in the cold dark where the writing and character development is spread a bit thin for the time they have to kill, but what can you expect here. Should have thrown in a T Tex or some ice dragons to distract us from sparse scripting. Still, the film gets that initial buildup deliciously right, the nervous windup to all out chaos, the editing between different characters and where they are when the monsoon shows up, and enough panicky surviving to make us thankful for that cozy couch and home theatre system all the more. One of the last of the finest, in terms the genre.\",\n",
       " \"THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSUtterly routine blockbuster, loosely based on scientific predictions of disastrous climate changes due to global warming, in which the Gulf Stream is essentially 'shut off', triggering a series of freak weather conditions (giant hailstones in Japan, tornadoes in Los Angeles, tidal waves in New York, etc.) which culminate in a new Ice Age. Dennis Quaid is the obsessive climatologist who struggles to convince sceptical authorities of the impending catastrophe, and who is forced to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) after the boy becomes stranded in Manhattan following torrential floods and the subsequent Big Freeze. Industrial Light & Magic unleashes a wealth of attention-grabbing visual effects during the film's impressive opening stretch, effectively sidelining the crudely drawn characters and half-baked melodramatics, but the superficial script (by Jeffrey Nachmanoff and director Roland Emmerich) fails to sustain the initial momentum, and the second half becomes bogged down in Quaid's ho-hum rescue mission. To be fair, the movie DOES contain a number of awe-inspiring sequences (the massive wave which rises from the ocean to engulf New York; the view from space as three colossal storms circle the entire northern hemisphere of the earth; a trawler floating serenely down a flooded Fifth Avenue), and a couple of satirical jabs are surprisingly potent (most notably, the mass exodus of American citizens INTO Mexico!), but the movie amounts to little more than smoke and mirrors, all flash and no substance.\",\n",
       " \"Spanish movie. Great ending. Thriller the entire way. Assuming you are like me and don't speak a lick of Spanish, trust me when I say you need to watch with subtitles on in Spanish language. That is a must. Watching the dubbed over version in English will ruin it for you.About a police officer who's first day on the job is tasked with driving an armored police truck to transport a half dozen or so very dangerous cons. During the trip, the truck is attacked in the middle of nowhere by a mysterious maniac who will stop at nothing to get inside the truck and kill one of the cons. Why that Is exactly you don't find out until the end.This movie has suspense from start to finish. Not a dull moment. Very serious. I can't recall chuckling once. Not a horror film but it tiptoes the line with a very eerie setting.I throughly enjoyed the acting and for a movie that takes place mostly from the constraints within an armored police truck, it had me on the edge of my seat throughout. I planned on only watching a bit of this movie and then going to bed as it was already late in the night when I started watching. The adrenaline of the movie kept me going to entire way and I easily finished it in one setting Features a surprise ending I didn't see coming. Has an element of darkness that I find attractive in suspense thrillers like this.If you're someone who can sit though foreign movies while reading the subtitles and you like suspense thrillers, this movie is well worth your time.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m not a big fan of Marvel and, in my opinion, their movies are mostly overrated. This one isn\\'t. This is probably the second best Marvel movie, after \"Guardians of the Galaxy\". If you expect a movie to have depth and the point, you should skip, not only this one, but whole Marvel production, but if you are looking for fun you are at the right place. Visually it is amazing. I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears. I gave it 8/10 within all the movies I ever watched, but within the genre, it is pure 10/10.8/10',\n",
       " \"This movie is fantastic. I truly enjoyed watching it! Unlike most other movies of Marvel franchise, there is a heavy emphasis on character development. This keeps audience glued to the story on a deep cellular level.The movie is littered with spiritual themes which adds further depth to this already amazing story.Those who like movies and TV series of medical genre are in for a treat. As the title suggests the story involves a doctor.I also like how the story blends in and moves forward, in prefect synchronization. Particularly given the complexity of the plot. Quite a tribute to the three screenwriters.Great movie, can't wait for the next one!\",\n",
       " 'I was lucky enough to be among the press-junket last Wednesday to witness this movie! I usually rate movies by different aspects, but i\\'ll also answer some questions my friends had about this film which I also had myself!Acting (10/10): This cast is amazing! They embody their characters instead of trying to act like the character. Benedict as Dr. Strange was a portrayal right out of the comics! Tilda as the ancient one killed it!Action (10/10): Wow! I could argue the action in this movie being on par with the scenes in civil war. It was so incredible watching this scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography. what else do you want?Story(8/10) : This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable one for once(stab, you\\'re welcome dc fans). It was not flawless though. The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary!Cinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange \"the magic\" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic movie yet of marvel.Overall, i\\'d give this movie an 8.5. Though this isn\\'t THE best marvel movie, it is truly one of best out there. After the disappointing Jason borne, jack reach er etc. we finally have a movie that lives up to the hype! GO Watch this movie in Max 3d if possible, because it is worth it for once!Some questions that my friends asked:\"Is this better than civil war?\" - Well visual-wise on par, but story-wise civil war is better for many reasons including the fact that civil war had a lot of background information to work with. This was more of a standardized origin film. \"Is there a post-credit scene?\" - Ah yes sir! Apparently there are two, but we got to see only 1. \"Is this the most mind-boggling thing you\\'ve ever seen on screen?\" - Ehm yes and no. Yes, because the effects were amazing and things I\\'ve never seen before. No, nothing was so mind-blowing that it made me think different of the world or something.',\n",
       " \"In terms of the quality of the film as a whole, I would give Doctor Strange a 7, but because of its visual effects and implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I am totally giving it an 8. Let me explain.Watching this in theaters with the sometimes too-loud sound, seeing the buildings and streets give way and rotate and otherwise bend themselves completely to a person's whim, immediately made me think of Inception. But this was even more hectic. This wasn't imaginary, this was real.Another thing. Finally in the MCU we have some sorcery, direct utilization of magical energy for combat. Discussion of other dimensions; even traveling between them at will. Doctor Strange's final outfit is just wicked cool. If you know the character from the Marvel comics, then you'll know that he's pretty damn powerful. Unfortunately this is an origins film, that is, it reveals how Doctor Strange became Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme; the real deal will come in the third Avengers film hopefully.As a follower of the MCU who's seen basically all of the released films to date, I was eagerly awaiting this one, and I was not dissatisfied. The music was riveting as usual per a Marvel film (Giacchino), the fight sequences intense, the otherworldly conflicts enormous. I'm so glad this guy's joining the Avengers in their imminent battle with Thanos, or at least I'm pretty sure he is. Now all that being said, Doctor Strange wouldn't fall in my top 5 MCU films; Captain America, Avengers 2, for example were much better, but it's part of the MCU, and therefore is a must-see for any MCU fan.I also noticed a lot more wit and almost off-character humor in this film than in other MCU films. And of course, as all the MCU films are taking place chronologically within the same universe (or multiverse?), there are several references to the bigger pictures, i.e. the Avengers.\",\n",
       " \"Way back when I first heard that Doctor Strange was being brought to the screen I was a bit worried. How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from the cheeseball stuff? Dress a guy up like the books and remain true to the seriousness of the character? Well, they managed to not only pull it off but deliver one of the best hero origin films ever made.The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it grounded but still trippy really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Harry Potter meets Iron Man meets Ant-Man flavor was there yet it all feels unique. The MCU magic is there literally. Everything established in the Captain America films and both Avengers pays dividends in a way here. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles get to shine. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. Add more than a dash of thriller aspects and a few new characters that steal every scene that they appear in.I honestly can't think of one way to improve this film. The result is a movie that's just flat out exceptional and that honestly delivers the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie.\",\n",
       " \"I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but damn, really 1 star on this movie. This movie did not deserve one star. Its hard to impress people. I do basic video editing and i really have a genuine appreciation for the people who work on video editing and effects. The people worked on dr strange really did something special with the visuals and i find it amazing what they created. Some of the people giving this movie 1 star i would like to see them create these visuals or take up video editing and special effects and see how easy it is to create this stuff. Even if you don't like the story i think just off visuals this movie at least deserved a 6. Its sad, to be in an artform like this because everyone is a critic and desensitized. Some movies i go to learn something from, some i go to because i want a good story, and some i go to for pure eye candy and fun. This movie is an eye candy movie. Yes there are other super hero movies with better stories but before going into doctor strange, i went for the visuals to see what they can do based on visuals i seen in the comics and to me they achieved the fantasy reality. I had pure fun watching this and im sorry i didn't see it in 3d because this is one of those types of movies you have to see in 3d. Sorry to the people who worked hard on this film. Its just not right that people gave it a 1 star. Its a 10 for me on visuals so im giving it a 10\",\n",
       " 'Perfectly enjoyable fun. Sound familiar? Doctor Strange being a different kind of hero doesn\\'t really excuse most of this film\\'s conventional plotting.There\\'s a much more interesting film in here, one in which Mads Mikkelsen isn\\'t the main villain (yet) and getting in the way of the hero\\'s journey and in which Tilda Swinton is even more ambiguous. Her obvious parallels to Stephen are perfectly apt and yet not allowed enough time to breathe and spin. It\\'s all a last minute reveal and then a call to arms because plot and all is well because plot.A lot has been made of the \"trippy\" special effects, and I guess they are compared to the traditional visuals employed in these types of movies. But let\\'s not get carried away. Besides the travels through space and mind it\\'s mostly buildings moving around like they\\'re in Inception.I didn\\'t buy the last end credits scene. Useless and not earned. I\\'m sick of hero\\'s with photographic memories. Let the hero be exceptional on their own merits. Action scenes could be less choppily edited.

Without a doubt, this is the closest to tripping you can experience in a cinema. However, all this eye-candy fails to hide the fact that underneath it all is a terrible, terrible, by-the-numbers film. It makes the same fatal error as Finn fighting Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens. The villain is powerful and experienced, but our hero, who is a beginner, manages to defeat him. This is only one of dozens of 'groan out loud' moments. The script is poor and the 'jokes' are misjudged. If there's one sure fire way of preventing your film from aging well, it's by inserting jokes about Beyonce. I can understand why Mads Mikkelsen did this film, as I'm sure he was well paid, but it's probably the worst film he's appeared in by a mile.Lazy and formulaic. I give it 3/10 only because it looks so good.\",\n",

There were only three of those \"out-of-this-world\" scenes and those scenes were done well (save for the first. Focusing on a violently shaking your head side to side while flashy colors are beaming around you is lazy film directing at best).The movie was not what it was hyped up to be by my friends, other critics, and reviews. It is a generic action flick with terrible attempts at comedy with the usual on-liner and unbelievable looks of \"How did you...\" then to \"I just did.\" and act all innocently.In short: This action/\"comedy\" movie is generic, bland, boring, with few action scenes just to make sure you are distracted by the endless, meaningless conversations. I expected more from this type of movie. 2/7P.S. This studio has become arrogant and lazy.',\n",

Fresh out of the military, unlucky in love and this close to losing his job. One day the ultimate fare literally falls into his lap as Leeloo enters his life via the roof of his cab. Leeloo it seems was genetically manipulated to be the ultimate weapon against pure evil but her beauty and butt-kicking hide a more fragile nature that Dallas and a host of others will have to step up and help her save humanity.This amazing sci-fi adventure from Luc (Leon) Besson has a little something for everyone. Beauty (the gorgeous Jovovich with orange hair even), action and gun-play, excellent acting, amazing visual effects, romance, creative sets and costume design, dynamic and interesting music and a mildly annoying but funny Chris Tucker. You name it\\x85this film has it in spades. 5th Element is hands down one of the best science fiction films ever.I've seen it many times and always want more. I highly recommended it.\",\n",
       " 'THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a complex film....if you WANT it to be! It offers varying levels of analysis depending on the tools you have to dig with! On the surface, a \"leave your brain in the cloakroom\" sci-fi yarn, you may well find wanting!  As far removed from STAR WARS as Austin Powers is from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. this film is pitched uniquely at those who can laugh at life but who have deep down an unquenchable desire for adventure and the romantic.Set on a futuristic earth, where really nothing has changed except the technology, Bruce Willis is STILL John McLane, a has-been stormtrooper reduced now to driving air-cabs for a living...same old premise for him - nothing\\'s changed much since STRIKING DISTANCE, except maybe the yellow hair-rinse. Now, legend has it that in a time long long ago, the forces of darkness visited earth and were repelled by the unification in close proximity, of four stones representing the four elements. earth, wind, fire and water together with a fifth \"element\" of unknown origin.Dear old Ian Holm is Priest Cornelius, an expert authority on the five elements and keeper of all knowledge on things magical and mysterious. Gary Oldman in arguably his most way-put role is General Zorg who has done a deal with \"The Dark Side\" and whose sole purpose is to take possession of the elemental stones. The scene wherein he demonstrates the new weaponry to his alien henchman (from which the one-line \"summary quote\" above is taken) is an absolute classic of cinema. Milla Jovovich (Married to Besson at the time of the flick) is absolutely rivetting as Leeloo, the cloned/unzipped humanised fifth element. She must have practised long and hard perfecting her ancient language dialog....it\\'s amazing. She strikes exactly the right note as a being of purity, femininity and warrior woman. As the film progresses she assumes the identitiy of the perfect girl any man would wish for and want to protect.The comedy angle is hysterical, the action sequences in your face, and the fx generally impressive if not mega weird at times. Color and visuals play a major role in this pro-European production, the continent where not surprisingly it was most successful. The outcome naturally is predictable and in the best traditions of \"will love save the day?\" as if it wasn\\'t always going to???So, there u have it. Watch it one-dimensionally and that\\'s what you\\'ll get back. let it flow, immerse yourself in IT and you couldn\\'t fail to have a good time, unless of course you are clinically dead or devoid of any sense of fun or fantasy ....but in that case you\\'d be wasting your time anyway, it wasn\\'t MADE for you!',\n",
       " 'At first, I didn\\'t know what to make of THE FIFTH ELEMENT. Much of it was corny; some of it was just stupid. But when I stopped taking the movie so serious, I really started to enjoy it. I thought it was a very fun movie.THE FIFTH ELEMENT is about an evil force coming to destroy the world. Five elements are needed to destroy the evil force and save the Earth. Four of them are stones and one of them is a beautiful woman named Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), who is absolutely \"perfect\". A priest named Cornelius (Ian Holm) seeks the elements to try to save the world while the military sends a the retired Major Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to find the elements and stop a bunch of alien bounty hunter-like bad guys and a very evil man (and of course very rich) man who is under the employment of the evil force named Zorg (Gary Oldman).And of course, there is the insane but loved radio DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) who gets trapped in the middle of this whole thing and becomes the comic relief of the movie, even though this movie really does not need comic relief. At first you will probably find him annoying, but he will grow on you. At least, this happened to me.The acting is fair, but nothing special. Chris Tucker does a good job as the nutcase radioman, and Ian Holm does a pretty good job as the priest set out to save the planet. This was a very different type of role for Gary Oldman. He was still a bad guy, of course, but it was a much more comical part. It surely wasn\\'t his best work, but it was still OK. Bruce Willis did a great job playing his part, and Milla Jovovich was excellent as the sexy but strong fifth element.The special effects were fantastic. The story to this movie is nothing big, but like I said the main purpose of this movie is for the viewer to have fun.

Which is lucky, since Evil is coming their way in the form of a big pulsating planet, assisted by the impossibly rich tycoon Zorg (Oldman), who is trying to locate the four stones so that Evil can prevail. After teaming up with a priest named Father Vito Cornelius (Holm) to find the stones, they travel to another planet on behalf of the Federation of the United States, where they meet up with various alien life forms who want to help or harm them, and their most frightening encounter of all, radio DJ Ruby Rhod. (Tucker)Truthfully, I am conflicted when it comes to my ultimate outlook on this film. Visually, it was completely captivating. The set designs, (layers of air traffic in the streets of New York, going up hundreds of stories, a floating Central Park) the costumes (Gaultier, with his usual S&M-looking couture) and the colorful hair and makeup were fantastic. A lot of the contraptions (a mask that instantly does your makeup, a cigarette machine that dispenses cigarettes with increasingly longer filters for those who are trying to quit smoking) were clever and entertaining, and the overall style of the film was impressive. There were certainly some things that were really odd to me that don\\'t really warrant explanation, I still scratched my head about, (like what was the deal with Gary Oldman sounding exactly like Billy Bob Thornton>) but ultimately chalked up to eccentricity.There wasn\\'t even anything universally wrong with the script; I thought that it was a very basic, but fun story, and I liked the fact that notorious badass Willis wasn\\'t so much living up to his reputation until we approached the end of the film. Unfortunately, I became more and more irritated with some of the \"humor\" (mostly slapstick type things; people saying, \"W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-what do you mean, a BOMB?!\" and the like\\x85 I think I heard \"W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w\" at least thirty times throughout the film) that was being presented. After viewing the film, I discovered that Besson had actually written this screenplay when he was in high school, something that is slightly impressive, but actually explains a lot in terms of the goofiness, I think. The other major irritant was Chris Tucker. I completely understand that his character was supposed to be way out there (kind of a cross between Prince and Grace Jones) but I think that the weird costumes, hair and mannerisms could have sufficed. Instead I had flashbacks to sitting in the theater watching \"Star Wars: Episode I\" and literally wanting to get up and hit something after listening to Jar-Jar Binks screech and prattle on. Tucker\\'s high-pitched voice and utter lack of charm did not win any points with me, and if anything, he made the film lose at least one point on my ratings scale. Other than the aforementioned things, there wasn\\'t a whole lot to dislike about \"The Fifth Element\" but there wasn\\'t really anything to get excited about either. If this film didn\\'t have the obnoxious Chris Tucker in it, I would consider it to be a great popcorn flick. Instead, even while just mentally flashing back to some of his scenes, I begin to feel like a drill is nearing my ear. However, because the film was fairly enjoyable other than his scenes, I give it a 5/10.--Shelly',\n",
       " 'Last night I watched \"The Fifth Element\" (1997) written /directed by Luc Besson for the first time - somehow I missed it and not being a huge fan of sci-fi, I did not search for it. Better later then never - the movie is pure and marvelous fun. It smiles at itself, does not take itself seriously and it is outrageously beautiful. It is a perfect mixture of Action / Adventure / Romance / Sci-Fi / Thriller/ with the comedy and the funny one, too. It seems to me that Steven Spielberg might have used some ideas of \"The Fifth Element\" in his great \"Minority Report\". The story\\'s five elements, four stones that represent water, earth, fire and air, and a perfect human creature - a girl, must together fight the absolute evil. Bruce Willis is as good as ever doing what he does best -fighting the bad guys (ugly scary aliens and very bad Gary Oldman with a hairdo you have to see to believe) and saving not just a hotel or one big city or even the great country but the Life as we know it. Luc Besson, the director, also wrote the story and the screenplay and I read that he had written it when he was 13. I think it is great that he adapted his own early writings because there is so much joy in it, the joy and happiness that only can be felt in one\\'s childhood. The visuals, the sound, and the music to the film are terrific. The costumes created by another boy-genius, \"enfant terrible\" of Paris haute couture Jean-Paul Gaultier will grab your eye and attention - so shockingly creative and unforgettable they are - the garment Milla was wearing in her first scene, for example. Who would think the wide band-aids can look so sexy yet innocent yet crazy when wrapped around a beautiful girl? Bruce Willis\\'s orange top that matches Milla\\'s blinding red hair, absolutely hilarious outfits DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) was proudly wearing? I am smiling now when I just think of them. Milla Yovovich possesses a rare exotic unusual beauty and the eyes, radiant and green like a new spring grass - she was a perfect choice for a perfect creature, the Mankind\\'s only hope for survival in the eternal ferocious struggle between Good and Evil, Creativity and Destruction, Life and Death, Love and Hatred.',\n",
       " \"TNG was the apex of the Star Trek universe. People loved it. It showed us sometimes flawed characters who always strived to be better than they were. These characters were developed on screen. They did more than just fight and argue and push the main plot of the story.TNG rewarded viewers with a sense of hope and something great to look and build forward to. It wasn't a reflection of what we as people ARE, but what we could so easily be.So what do we get if we take TNG and remove the wonder of discovery, the passion to explore, any sense of warmth, ALL OPTIMISM, futuristic technological innovation, actors who connect with their characters, imagination, the rigid moral structure, discipline, professionalism, alien races, special effects, and just make the entire thing a bit more common and profane? We get a glimpse of what the future would be like if the most spoiled, selfish, weak people populated the world and the only advancements humanity made were technological.Class warfare. Limited resources. A disdain for age / accomplishment. And just a few little ties thrown in to try to lure fans of Voyager and TNG in hoping some percentage of them will stay for a bland, frozen, microwaved version of what was once a favorite dish.It's great to see Patrick Stewart acting in this, but it'd be even better if he'd reprise the role of Jean-Luc Picard in more than just name.\\nDear Gene Roddenberry,We respectfully disagree with your Utopian vision of tomorrow. The future is actually just a bunch of fearful, self-centered, bickering millennials (some of which have pointy ears and others of which are robots) driven by a raging torrent of emotions to do whatever feels good.

       " \"Yes, something new may unfold because of this new series. For the first time in history it's possible that the hard core fans of the franchise would demand canceling the show after season 1.We know that in the past some series survived because of the fans' requests and pressure. It happened with The Expanse, and, to a limited degree, with Firefly. With the last one, the fans didn't get a season 2 but they did get a movie.I've read a lot of reviews and the disappointment is real, clear and it comes from the people who love the Star Trek universe. What is the criticism? No more stand alone episodes. No more exploration of the Universe. No more hope in the human race, hope that what we have now and is bad-like cruelty, careless, greed-will go into remission in the future. No more logic and detached reasoning. No more inspiring visions of the future.What do we want from Star Trek? A world in which the contrast between the future and the present is as substantial as the contrast between our world and the Dark Ages. We want to see an ideal team, formed by people who know how to communicate, respect and value each other. We want people capable to contain their emotions and the worst aspects of their personalities. We want to see how a group of people are capable to solve a tough problem every episode. Solve it with intelligence, diplomacy, creativity, grace. We want to see a group of people passionate about the unknown, Universe and science. We want analysis of moral dilemmas, and yes, like we've seen in TNG, a culture without religion.Fortunately, there are some alternatives for you as a sci-fi fan: Black Mirror, The Expanse, even The Orville.\\nUnfortunately, CBS left us with only one alternative: Trekxit.\",\n",
       " \"Star Trek Picard started out all right for the first episode. By the 2nd episode, it started to become obvious that this was never going to be as good as the Star Trek shows and movies between 1966-2005.Firstly, the writing was all over the place, and the story was, for the most part, superficial to non-existent. So many sub-plots were never followed up with or clarified, and questions were left unanswered. Writers magic was used in so many cases where a more dedicated person would have thought things out sensibly. For example, the 'imagination tool'. Also, the situation surrounding the federation's fall were not on par with what the Star Trek universe lore had set up already, and the only way it could have fallen that way was if people from today took over the future and ran it with today's knowledge. Some of the decisions they made were completely ridiculous, and made it seem like somehow the Star Trek universe lost most of its intelligence since Voyager returned from the Delta Quadrant. It was just a complete mess.Secondly, the acting was unconvincing. They were just going through the movements of an unbelievable story. They obviously didn't believe it and are clearly rooted in today's world instead of Star Trek's. I didn't care for any of the characters, and found most of them to be unlikable. Even Picard was a shell of his once interesting self, not the strong leader he once was. The actor who played Data was the best of the bunch when he played Data, but was also unlikable when he played human roles.Thirdly, excessive swearing was difficult to take serious after Star Trek set 40 years of good storytelling, showing a future that had evolved from excessive swearing, or didn't use it at all, and opted to be diplomatic and intellectuals instead. In Picard we had juvenile foul-mouthing in most every episode. In fact, it ruined the whole series and completely took me out of it right from episode 2 when it was first used.Fourthly, the show-runners were laying heavily on the nostalgia card, betting on name dropping, and character pop-ups from former series. This alone was the first indication to me that they knew they didn't have a story. By the end of the season it turned out nostalgia was the only real card they had to play. It felt like they were patronizing fans and insulting their intelligence with this, and even that turned into a waste since it didn't help a trash-heap story at all.Lastly, it was obvious they were doing their best to hold back political correctness as much as they could (probably from backlash in Discovery), but it still kept creeping in. They let it ruin much of the Star Trek lore, and now it's clear they're ready to come out with it in full force for season 2, which is poised to be another aimless season that they'll make up on the fly, or possibly plagiarize.This isn't Star Trek.Star Trek is about a future to strive for, and to aspire to be like - better than ourselves today. But every movie and show since the finale of the Enterprise show in 2005 has completely ignored this, and Picard is no different. We are presented with a darker future, one that is not inspiring, or even worth striving for. It's now the opposite, and makes me want to fight any future like that from arriving.I gave it 10 episodes, and after the disappointment wore off and after gathering my thoughts over the last 2 months, I've decided I will not watch another episode of this. Even though Picard is not as bad as Discovery, it's the second worse Star Trek series created, and the second Star Trek series that doesn't interest me at all.What i wanted was a thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating show, depicting a future worth striving for, wanting to visit. Possibly in stand-alone episodes so they could be watched in any order. I ended up getting an uninteresting soap-opera wannabe, set in a future i don't care about, that heavily mirrors current political correctness insanity, and that i don't want to see any more of.0/10\",\n",
       " \"So many fans wanted to see a show about the Federation rebuilding itself after the Dominion War and rediscovering its moral and cultural center, and exploring the struggles of reforging its alliances.. Instead we got a show that further attacks the heart and soul of the franchise. Rather unfortunate, honestly.Picard is a show that, rather than reviving Star Trek and breathing fresh air into an old idea, takes it further down the path of dystopian science fiction, focusing on tired subject matter and cheap action to drive it forward rather than focusing on providing good story telling, interesting characters, and deep exploration of the world around them.STP is a very flawed show that had all the potential in the world, but didn't apparently have the talent and vision behind the scenes to make it work. The tone is all over the place. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. And the plot is pretty much recycled from any of the many other shows about secret organizations and terrorism that have been made in the last couple decades. They had a whole universe to explore, an endless number of good choices that could have been made, and they chose to focused on interpersonal drama, terrorism, and secret plots. So very boring and unoriginal.The camera work can get pretty bad, too, as can the acting and dialogue. Half the time it feels like they are trying to force a response from the audience that the scene isn't naturally providing. I simple conversation with overly dramatic music, for example. Or a scene with odd camera work that doesn't feel right.Picard has its redeeming moments, don't get me wrong, but they seem few and far between. Mostly it's a pretty juvenile show. Patrick Stewart often feels out of place in this off-kilter version of the Star Trek universe they have created, and unnecessary to the story. Certain scenes they have chosen to include are downright cringe worthy, in fact.Of all the directions they could have taken the franchise this seems like one of the worst, and it is unfortunate. I can watch the older shows time and again, yet found myself struggling to get through this show even once. It is just so unoriginal. So many other shows have explored these subjects and told this story, and done it better. Star Trek deserves better than this.I very reluctantly feel obligated to give this show the score it deserves 5/10. Passive entertainment with few memorable moments and a lot of creative issues.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, there\\'s Picard and yes, there\\'s guest appearances of old crew members here and there but that\\'s about it. No Enterprise, no trek across the stars of significant scale and Jean-Luc Picard shoved to the sidelines without carrying any meaningful responsibility nor excercising leadership.Instead, we have a ragtag crew of drunkards, a biologist suffering from borderline personality disorder, a female pinocchio and a kid with a sword. The convoluted story of the whole first season revolves around a topic that would maybe span two episodes of \"normal\" Star Trek episode. Meanwhile, they throw in so many flashback scenes, further slowing the pace and dragging out the story to a point you really wish they\\'d finally get it over with already.The writing of the whole series is so unexciting, you don\\'t even feel the need to watch the next episode after the previous one ended. And thus, the writers rely on unfunny one-liners and throwing the viewers small bones in form of guest appearances.And what does the inclined Star Trek fan do? He\\'s hanging on from episode to episode, hoping for the \"Star Trek\" to begin - but it never does. Which is a shame, considering the production value and overall quality of the cast.So, whatever Kurtzman\\'s and Stewart\\'s vision for the second season of the show is - I hope it takes us back to the universe we all love so much, because right now it\\'s neither Star Trek, nor Picard.',\n",

I shushed my kids during new TNG episodes because I couldn\\'t wait for the video tape to watch it. I watched DS9, Voyager, the films, the cartoons- I even broke down and watched \"Enterprise,\" just to get the monkey off my back. (\"Way to kill the franchise, Bakula!\") And Discovery- never mind.\\nI\\'ve put up with a lot over the years- walking around with \\'Robot Commando\\' Spock, searching the universe for his missing brain, whiney Captain Janeway and her heroic poses, watching a hot Vulcan go topless for ratings, or Tom Hardy in a lovely evening gown, goofy-looking Klingons in Elizabethan armor, and so on. But I love Star Trek, so I put up with it.\\nNow someone has turned it ugly. In episode 5, I am expected to watch a man get his eyeball drilled out of his head and listen to him screaming all the way through it. I don\\'t want to see that on any show, but on Star Trek it makes me feel betrayed. I want to watch ST with my grandsons. I don\\'t want torture and sadism featured on my favorite show. I\\'m willing to suspend my disbelief, put up with bad writing and gaping plot holes, listen to rabid and thinly-disguised moral or political agendum, even see some of my heroes fall. But suddenly the whole ST universe is dark, and the future is no longer hopeful. Is the world really that way? Sure. But that was the appeal of this alternate universe- its overall message was, \"things will eventually be... okay.\"\\nIf you guys want to make an edgy, dark sci-fi drama, fine. But make your own show- don\\'t ruin Star Trek to do it.',\n",
       " 'There seems to be a total inability at the moment for writers to create intelligent, consistent and positive stories on television. Everything has to be based on disaster, conflict, discriminations and personal point-scoring agendas. That added with a contemporary obsession for using tokenism (through ridiculously over-powered characterisation and reverse stereotyping), realism-breaking CGI and a gratuitous use of cynicism. Perhaps this is one reason why watching old episodes of Star Trek: The Next a Generation still brings so much joy and hope to people? A positive, realistic and intricately-created future world that actually we\\'d all like to live in and humanity could aspire to.So, after scrapping years of terrible \\'style-over-substance\\' reboots and non-intelligent efforts which use the franchise in name only, we now receive Star Trek: Picard. At last (I hear fans shout), a show that moves on the original timeline on and expands upon the ideals of Gene Roddenberry\\'s utopian (if not, then hopeful) universe?Sadly, not it seems. For this new reincarnation seems to fall into the pitfalls that many current television creations seem to find themselves in. There\\'s little in it\\'s USP to make it standout from the dystopian fantasy genre the producers have decided to place it in. It\\'s truly hard and, if totally honest, painful to watch something you grew up caring so much about being desecrated in such a crude and moronic manner. This new world is dark, bleak and lacks any feel for what Star Trek should be about. It doesn\\'t feel canon. It\\'s melodramatic. It\\'s totally unrealistic, straying away from its exploration and evolutionary values of humanity. The musical soundtrack is so over the top and constant, that it makes 80s action film scores seem underplayed.But most of all, where has the intelligence gone from this world? Why has technology gone backwards? Why has the Federation, that spawned so many good people built on solid moral principles, regressed to a selfishly immoral antagonist? Why do all the alien races now look the same? Why would a universe ban \"synthetic life\" after a disaster and not work together to find out what went wrong and learn from it? I seriously could write a more plausible storyline from my lounge.I\\'m sorry Gene, but it seems Hollywood has let you down once again.',\n",
       " \"Once again the ball has been completely dropped in a new Star Trek show/movie.Apart from some of the previous actors and the nostalia they carry, this is nothing like the classic Star Trek, while also not bringing anything new and original to the series.The side characters are meaningless, feels like Picard could have went on his own on the mission and the outcome would have been the same.I have no idea who these new people are and I don't care what happens to them. One episodic character from the classics had more personality and involvement in the plot that these people had in 10 episodes.Then there's the Borg, so much hype in the trailer, so much hype to see them, only for it to lead nowhere, their presense was nothing more than a taxi service.Whoever owns the Star Trek rights now has a hard time understanding what made it great. Pro tip: it wasn't lazers and sword fights. It was the characters and their relations, their dialogue, their rapport.Also what's up with all the damn lens flares? When did actual cinematic vision go into the dumpster and it was decided that blasting a light as high as you can in the middle of an indoor scene adds any value? Just stop. It's annoying.Since we're all in lockdown/isolation/quarantine, I guess you can watch it, after you're done watching all the older Star Trek series, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, all the Stargate series(including Universe, it gets better before they cancel it), and Duck Dodgers. These are all space shows which are better value for your time than anything Star Trek related released in the last decade.\",\n",

How the hell is it possible for this to be so bad with such a high budget? Did they spend everything on the intro or something?Magic device that can fix anything with the power of imagination?

Maybe this was the point but the writers have got this terribly wrong.What would have been so wrong with bringing a retired Picard back to active duty to face some genuine new threat, maybe a resurgent Borg with Picard and 7 of 9 mankinds best hope. Re-assemble some of the team and keep the pacing brisk and a new generation will fall in love with the characters and ensemble but what we get is pitiful.Sack all the writers, get a new show-runner and give us a good character driven story with heart as this was the attraction of TNG and testament to its enduring appeal even to this day.Picard Season 1, hit the delete button.',\n",
       " 'Recently I binged The Clone Wars, and then binged Rebels immediately after. I prefer TCW, but Rebels is definitely under-appreciated. The show is actually a pretty good animation depicting the Imperial Age of Star Wars. It does for the original trilogy timeline, what TCW\\'s did for the prequel trilogy timeline; flesh out new stories. It makes for highly entertaining TV. Sure, it may be childish at times, but, much like The Clone Wars, perfectly balances mature content with the childish content. Star Wars fans of any age can watch this and enjoy.The series overall starts slow and childish, but still fun all the same. It gets more mature as the show progresses, with a more childish tone episode thrown in here and there. It includes great cameos from both Prequel trilogy and Original trilogy characters. Seeing R2-D2 and C-3PO bless the show with their presence at the start was a treat. As seeing Leia, Lando, Darth Vader, Yoda, Obi-Wan, etc. Rebels also picks up some storylines from the unfinished Clone Wars show, which is now set to be finished at the time of this writing. Seeing Darth Maul, Ahsoka and Rex brought back are extremely hype-worthy moments, that only add to the show.Overall, Rebels isn\\'t a masterpiece, but it is entertaining and enjoyable material expanding the Star Wars universe. It is far better than the new trilogy Star Wars has been cooking up. Rebels actually has an interesting band of characters, unlike the new movies. I\\'ve seen Ezra called the \"Aladdin of Star Wars,\" which I don\\'t think is necessarily a bad thing. We see him mature over the course of the series. Kanan, the wise Jedi mentor, is my personal favorite character. He serves as one of the last links to the past. Hera, the skilled pilot of the crew, she and Kanan\\'s relationship was something truly special. Sabine\\'s character gives an interesting expansion on what it means to be Mandalorian. And Zeb is there mostly for comedic relief. Can\\'t forget Chopper, as he is easily one of the highlights of the show. The hilarious astromech that just oozes personality whenever he beeps, much like R2 does. There is a slew of supporting characters that are great as well, such as Agent Kallus, Grand Admiral Thrawn, etc.Star Wars Rebels is a great expansion to the Star Wars lore and stories. The music is wonderful, as always for the franchise, and the show gets better as you continue along, just like TCW did. Give it a chance if you love Star Wars. Watch The Clone Wars first, and you won\\'t be disappointed.My Rating: 8.25/10',\n",
       " 'I really dont get why so many people gave bad reviews for this show?\\nThis is a fantastic show with great characters and amazing plot lins which just get better with every season.This show is about Ezra Bridger, a young force sensitive boy who joins a rebel cell with cool new characters like Kanan, Sabine, Zeb and Chopper and we see the early beginning of the rebellion between episode 3 and 4.\\nAnd I love some of the new characters, especially Zeb, Chopper and Ezra and they have such chemistry together and it is lovely to see how they evolve and how they interact with each other.I must admit, that I dont like the animation style as much as the Clone Wars style, but it is ok and you get used to it. I get when people call it more kid friendly but still, there are cool plotlines and a good laugh arent something bad in my opinion and I think it gets more adult friendly as the show continues. Ok, there are some filler episodes that arent really relevant and of course there are some stupid episodes, but almost every show has moments that you dont enjoy, but the majority of the episodes are really fun to watch and the bring something new to the World of Star Wars and they expand the Canon.\\nThat are the only negative things I could think about and I dont believe that they are really bad or are hurting the show.What else I really like is, that we get a new look on older Characters like Darth Vader, Maul, Ahsoka Tano, Captain Rex, Princess Leia, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Bo-Katan, Hondo Ohnaka and others and they do their part in delivering some cool plotlines.On top of that we also get some more new Characters integrated into the Canon, like Great Admiral Thrawn, Agent Callus, The Bendu or the Inquisitors. And all of them bring something new to the world and it is nice to see how the characters evolve over the seasons.The only reason why Rebels only gets a 9/10 instead a 10/10 is simply that it isnt integrated as much into the overarching Star Wars Story as for example The Clone Wars and Rebels stands on its own for the most part and even the ending didnt really get a final conclusion and is still left open.\\nBut of course that can change in the near future with the second season of the Mandalorian where Bo-Katam and Ahsoka should make their Live-Action debut and maybe we even see other characters returning. And maybe even there will even be some connections to the upcoming Obi-Wan show or the Cassian Andor show. And if that happens and Rebels will have a bigger impact on the entire Franchise, then I am sure I will lift this up to a 10/10.Still I would recommend it to every Star Wars fan, because it is an amazing addition to the Canon and you should build your own opinion about the show',\n",
       " 'For me, as a fan of \"Star Wars\" since childhood, it was a real gift, even a surprise, because I did not expect that I would get to the show.What can I say: the series is \"episode 3.5\" - the plot is located between the \"Sith Place\" and \"New Hope\". In the first series, the creators have saturated the plot with the atmosphere of a \"distant-distant galaxy\". Every now and then, the imperial storm troopers and their commanders step on the screen, and this instantly causes nostalgia for the very first film of 1977. The atmosphere is just as gloomy, the characters are completely new (unlike the animated series \"Clone Wars\"), but this should not prevent loyal fans from enjoying a pleasant feeling. In addition, one of our old acquaintances, and possibly even two, has penetrated the premiere series.The protagonist who hates the Empire, the boy Ezra, is an orphan who survives by theft. By the will of fate, he encountered a small group of resistance, which does everything to annoy the despotic Empire. This group is the rudiments of a rebel alliance (in the series the famous symbol of the rebels flashes), and this meeting will forever change the life of Ezra ...The pilot \"Rebels\" is a story about friendship and a difficult choice, as well as about the sense of duty. This is 44 minutes, allowing you to plunge again into a familiar atmosphere (there was especially a musical accompaniment, similar to the creation of maestro John Williams), that already goose bumps are provided. Beautiful, eye-pleasing graphics remained at the same level as in Clone Wars. The action will be enough: chasing motorcycles (by voice acting and by drawing this scene can be called a reference to \"The Return of the Jedi\") and classic skirmishes on blasters, which so likes, which Han Solo trusts. In general, the pilot of the \"Rebel\" turned out to be very sound, memorable, interesting. And most importantly - the desire to watch has arisen after the first series (although in some serials, retraction occurs through several episodes).So I\\'ll watch a new chapter of the ZV on, those more, I\\'ve been waiting for her very much. After all, after looking at Clone Wars, I wondered if the dark spot between the III and IV episodes of the saga would illuminate. That\\'s the answer, and he\\'s the most affirmative! Evaluation of the pilot Rebels (of course, apart from the series as a whole):10 of 10',\n",
       " 'If you happen to view any of the other \"reviews\" here you\\'ll find that many have given abysmal ratings for the show because of trivial reasoning; many because they\\'re still rather perturbed over the status of the Expanded Universe, others seem like attempts at trolling, and many are spiteful simply because they don\\'t agree with the concept of the show and cannot accept that the Expanded Universe isn\\'t coming back. One even seems to have gone the full-on melodramatic route and declared Star Wars to be dead and that they won\\'t be showing their younger siblings Star Wars at all due to this horrible tragedy.Should you view the individual ratings given to the show you\\'ll find that the general opinion is favorable with votes generally increasing the higher up the ratings you go, save for a rather blatantly obvious discrepancy. The ratio of \"1/10\" reviews compared to the others has been grossly blown out of proportion by people whose anger seems to have overcome them.The characters are perfectly fine, the animation could have been better I will admit, and the pacing for the premiere was quick and could have taken more time to breath but when all has been said and done the show has learned from the mistakes made during the early seasons of The Clone Wars and has applied those lessons much the same as the latter seasons did.People talking about how the designs or appearances of things are off haven\\'t been paying attention to the development of the show, as the creators have on numerous occasions cited the reasoning behind the changes and additions. The Imperial\\'s equipment has taken a design cue from Kenner\\'s classic line of toys adored by children who grew up on Star Wars, fans, and collectors alike. The show takes places five years before \"Star Wars\" and as such they wanted everything to feel extremely familiar while being off just enough to give the feel of this being a different time period. The TIE Fighters have shorter wings, the stormtrooper\\'s helmets are more bulbous and their blasters have a small hump along the spine, and the REX droids from Star Tours serve as pilots on spacecraft. The camera remains static and far less dynamic to mimic the movement of the original movies while even switching to mimic 70mm film during space sequences. The lightsabers flicker and are flatter, green light cracks whenever two blades meet, and pulling out a lightsaber feels special again. Every single detail has been carefully considered and crafted to capture the feel of the Original Trilogy Era and movies.It\\'s Firefly meets Star Wars with a ragtag crew running around the edge of civilized space trying to get by and hitting the Empire whenever the chance is presented. It\\'s classic Star Wars and exactly the kind of thing you\\'d like should you be a fan of Star Wars at all.',\n",
       " \"Season One (2014) There's a familial heart to this first season which makes it immediately appealing, centering on building a strong foundation in the relationships of our main cast and giving us an idea how tightly knit they would become over the series. The first season flounders a little when it comes to properly conveying the threat of the Empire, a flaw which is rectified very efficiently by the arrival of Grand Moff Tarkin; and it builds to a bold and satisfying resolution that lets the audience know that, like Clone Wars before it, Rebels is not afraid to push boundaries and embrace the Darker Side of Star Wars stories.Season Two (2015) Where the first season placed a lot of focus on Kanan and Ezra, the second expands that focus to envelop the entire crew, taking their small weekly victories and allowing the events of the series to greater influence those on a galactic scale. It builds on the familiar and begins to dabble in new and darker ideas, opening the story up to unimaginable levels of potential; and the raw emotion at the heart of the season's climactic finale, an epic confrontation years in the making, gives fans the duel they never knew they wanted and makes them pay for it tenfold in heart-wrenching tension.Season Three (2016) By far the most stylistic and best looking the series has ever been, the third season deals heavily with the consequences of the previous two, moving the story forward and making our heroes pay for every small victory they have achieved. Though a thorough and calculated slow burn to the finale, we are rewarded with some of the most visually stunning sequences in Star Wars animation; building toward a conclusion so rife in tension and nail-biting action as to be worthy of Grand Admiral Thrawn's inclusion to the series.Season Four (2017) The fourth and final season is by far the strongest and most coherent of the series, blending the classically episodic nature of previous seasons into one long continuous story that grows and evolves week on week. But even through a season of some of the best action and most revolutionary additions to the mythology, the heart of the show is still its family of central characters and their powerful bond; forcing them to choose between their allegiances to the Rebellion and their relationships with each other as they face their hardest challenges and most tragic losses ever.\",\n",
       " 'I love Star Wars - the basic premise of an epic universe, battle of good vs evil, classic take on characters and their traits and promoting clean and pure values...Most of us love (or have loved) Star Wars for those reasons.Now, do you think kids and younger teenagers will want to watch 30 year old movies and will be susceptible to the story and its values despite the \"prehistoric\" graphics and effects? Unfortunately, most of them won\\'t be attracted and will watch it if you make them and look at it through that lens to some extent - and that is reality.So if you look at \"Rebels\" as a new branch in that universe, fresh content promoting the same types of characters, similar story lines and the same values - can it not be only positive that it exists? To attract today\\'s kids and to provide content of this kind to them, instead of them watching Game of Thrones, Dexter and alike?I understand that, as a die-hard Star Wars fan of 30 or 40, you can disprove the lack of originality, the relative crudeness of animation and what not - but, hey - this is Star Wars, just the same as it always has been - if you loved it before, there is no reason to hate it now, in this form.So I would understand reviews of 6+, but 1? That\\'s just lame.As a 31 year old, I found it interesting and entertaining and a nice watch. Worth my time and certainly worth your kid\\'s time.

       " \"Unlike most fans of the classic franchise, I'm not gonna blast this series out of my sights just because Disney owns and distributes it. I'm also not letting the EU's loss get in the way of my thoughts on the new series. I'd also like to make it clear that Lucasfilm Animation has done the work, not Disney as so many silly fans have come to believe.Now then, Star Wars Rebels: Spark of the Rebellion has proved itself to be a fantastic beginning to the new series. It's a much better first impression than the terrible 2008 Clone Wars movie. The characters are likable. Ezra is sneaky and charming. Kanan is cool yet mysterious. Hera is kind and motherly. Sabine is crazed and wild. Zeb is bullyish and violent. Chopper doesn't seem to like or care about anyone. Even the main villain of this episode, Agent Kallus, proves to be a badass, hellbent on capturing our heroes. Not only are these characters so entertaining to watch interact with each other but the story is loads of good fun. It never becomes too childish for adult viewers or too graphic for very young viewers. It's as well balanced as the Original Trilogy that first started back in 1977. It's funny, clever, actiony, and intense at certain moments. It all feels like Star Wars. More so than any other Star Wars show that's ever been on TV. The interesting characters, fun story, and balanced tone make this totally worth you're time for future episodes. If you wanted to feel like a kid watching the original Star Wars again, then look no further. The Force is strong with Rebels.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve seen the whole \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" series, all 6 seasons, and it was tremendous, I gave it a 10. When the Clone Wars stopped, I had my hopes up for this Rebels series, but sadly it has not the same (or higher) level. Where in The Clone Wars literary every character was explained, the history been shown, even made up some characters who also could master the force, the origin of the light-sable, and to top it of the genesis of the good and bad sides, the Rebels series just revolves around stealing from the Empire. No matter what angle they start an episode, it always ends up stealing something, pretty boring, my kids even stopped watching after 5 episodes. And where in the old days the top notch hit series \"Robotech\" was more then just another science fiction, it contained hope and bravery and death and life, so did the Clone Wars series, they died, they sacrificed themselves etc. The rebels series is just so dull and revolves around ... nothing. I believe Disney is the reason for this, every series or movie Disney makes is stripped of everyone of the letter mentioned (delicate) emotions to make a mainstream production. I really hope the series will be better the next season and not so shallow.',\n",
       " 'About a week ago I wrote a comment that ranked \"Rebels\" as a 3 of 10 after watching all but the last episode on the 1st Season. Well I stuck with the series and am about half-way through Season 2 and I gotta admit that the characters are really starting to grow on me. I\\'m even starting to love Chopper (the overly emotive astromech; think R2D2 on emotional steroids). Maybe it was the appearance of Darth Vader, or maybe it was Ahsoka, or maybe it was Agent Kallus, or the Inquisitors, or all of the above, but I went from disliking this series to almost loving it. It\\'s not up there with \"Clone Wars,\" but I\\'d say it\\'s a good, solid sequel. So now I\\'d rate this series as 7.5 of 10.Below is my previous review (I withdraw it).What a huge disappointment...A coworker of mine bought me a 3-month Netflix subscription card this past Christmas. So I\\'m checking out all the possibilities and I see the animated series \"Star Wars - Clone Wars\" and I think to myself: ah, sure, why not?Well I got to tell you, that was an excellent choice! I absolutely fell in love with that series. I love the characters (especially Ahsoka Tano), the animation, the plot lines, the dialogue. It\\'s an animated series for adults, with complicated plots and complex moral dilemmas.But I finished watching the six seasons and felt a need for more Star Wars fare. Then I noticed that there\\'s another animated series, \"Star Wars Rebels\" that takes place about 15 years after the conclusion of Clone Wars. I was super excited, but Netflix doesn\\'t offer it, so I decided to buy the 1st season DVDs off Amazon.That was a huge mistake.A few minutes into the very 1st episode I realized that this is a children\\'s cartoon -- totally different maturity level from Clone Wars. I\\'d say the target demographics would be children, maybe tweens, or early adolescents, but nothing beyond 16 years old. Everything about this series is such a letdown: the characters, the silly dialogue, the \"god-mode\" invulnerability of the six Rebels themselves (no matter how many storm troopers or tie fighters are blasting away, none of the Rebels even suffers a scratch, while all of the Imperials are taken out of action -- with the exception of a newly introduced Dark Side character -- will not mention the name). He is actually a pretty cool antagonist, but he\\'s not enough to make up for all the many, many shortfalls in this unworthy sequel to Clone Wars.I\\'m struggling to get through episode 12, figured I spent the money, I should at least watch all 15 -- but it\\'s a tough slog.Rebels is so awful that I actually miss Jar-Jar Binks, and I never thought I\\'d live to see the day when I\\'d type that out onto the intertoobs for all the world to see (or at least the world as represented by IMDb).3 out of 10.',\n",
       " \"I love clone wars its an amzing show and I remember when it ended the first time i was gutted then I started to watched this show i even use to watch the shorts leading up to this series and at first I thought I wouldn't like it but i was very wrong.Season 1 was a slow but entertaining season it really picks up from season 2 and rebels has got some of the best star wars content out there i don't understand why people are hating on like yeah they say they cant stand the animation but i dont care about that i was just really into the story as i am a star wars fan after all not an animator.People if you haven't watched it some how go watch it you will love it its got less boring fillers than clone wars and its definitely a good show for the star wars fans specially if you are a die hard star wars fan and also im hoping that they have a sequel series to this show as it finished like there is way more to tell so give this show some love and it might happen.\",\n",
       " \"Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid and those are the reasons I give it a 3 instead of lower. The characters do predictable stupid things over and over.. Is there danger? Yes so RUN OUT IN THE OPEN instead of going inside. As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.And of course there is ALWAYS an SUV, or Quad right at hand when our hero's need one... keys in it of course... yet all the screaming people have been running right by them rather then jumping in and driving the hell away.Yes, it's a movie but can't we keep at least some reality of physics in dino stories. It is NOT possible for ANY flesh and blood animal to swing it's arms and tails around and smash thru huge concrete columns and turn them to dust without doing massive damage to their own body. Yet time and again the arms and tails go swinging and knocking down multiple foot thick concrete stuff.And really, you are going to take out these dinos with assault rifles? Of course the assault rifles are worthless but someone did have the sense to bring ONE grenade launcher with them which blows up dino's just in the nick of time. And of course we wouldn't want to give away our position although we do shine laser gun sights right at the dino which would lead them straight back to where the gun holder is.How on god's green earth this movie gets 10's is beyond me. Even if you ignore the stupidity, etc it is SO predictable that there is not a moment of suspense in the whole thing.\",\n",
       " 'Twenty years ago, people decided to play with evolution and resurrected long-extinct species. The amusement park, where the main attraction was dinosaurs, was to be a hit, but became famous for its tragic deaths. After a while people decided to give a lucrative idea a second chance, and here appeared the \"World of the Jurassic period\", offering visitors an unforgettable family vacation. But how much safer is it than its predecessor?Return to the big screens of great and toothy was just a matter of time. The story was too good to leave her alone. Inspired by a new life entrusted to director Colin Trevorow, who himself is a big fan of dinosaurs. He decided to show how he could bring the insatiable and out-of-control desire of humanity to be constantly entertained. In pursuit of money and new impressions, they bring out a new species, never before stepped on our planet. What can go wrong?The characters of the film, especially as for those who work in such a dangerous amusement park, where accidents happen all the time, are mostly too careless and narrow-minded. The owner of the island does not know at all what is being deduced in his laboratories, the security system operates only when the animals behave decently, one wants to write down as a matter of fact the wild raptors to serve in the army, and children can easily escape and during an alarm to stay alone on the field among dinosaurs, because the employees of the attraction are too busy saving their skins and incompetent to the limit. And what to do, when a huge dangerous predator of a new breed escapes, nobody knows at all.Well, that on the island works a certain Owen, who almost only understands that dinosaurs are living creatures, not toys. Chris Pratt\\'s play here is pretty plausible, especially its interaction with the raptors. In the light of rumors that he might become the new Indiana Jones, it was nice to see him in a similar image, which he is very much following. The Pratt company is Bryce Dallas Howard, for whom this is the next vivid role after the \"Servants\". She has her own moments and potential, but it feels like the writers specifically held her back so that she did not become equal with him, preferring to keep her heroine in the shadow of Owen. By the way, the only actor from the original was BD Wong, who again embodied Dr. Henry Wu.\"The world of the Jurassic period\" is clearly aware that it is simultaneously the continuation of the original, and the restart of history, which should breathe new life into the franchise. To the very original, creators reacted almost with sacred trembling, references to \"Park\" are found throughout the entire film. There is even a character-geek performed by Jake Johnson, who seems to be the embodiment of the fandom.Steven Spielberg, of course, put his hand to this continuation of his prehistoric brainchild, but only as an executive producer. Together with Trevorow and the huge team behind the creation of this blockbuster, we are going to an island where many would like to visit, despite the deadly danger in its cages.The dinosaurs themselves on the screen impress with their realism. When raptors appear, it\\'s like seeing old and almost kind friends. With them, there are a lot of great moments, in particular their communication with Owen. Their joint pursuit, depicted on the poster for the film, is one of the most exciting moments of the franchise. But the most impressive episode is the final battle of dinosaurs. I was delighted with who the writers were instructed to save everyone from the new predator. The original is always steeper than any remake.Continuing 2 hours, this adventure will not let you get bored and will please the dinosaur lovers, who opened their mouths with surprise and delight at viewing the \"Park\". The plot of \"Peace\" is based on the idea that formed the basis of the original: people played in the gods. Heroes again create what they can not control, and then pay for it. It would seem that it is time for mankind to learn from its mistakes, but, judging by the history, we often do them again and again. And the creation of dinosaurs is far from the most serious of them.Crossing the types of the most dangerous dinosaurs, it is worth to be prepared for the fact that family rest on such an island will turn into a chase for survival.',\n",
       " \"Much like Jurassic World, this load of junk was created purely to rake in the dollar.Apparently it's OK to show the world... AGAIN... live goats waiting to be eaten, pigs going to be ripped to shreds by teams of raptors and people being torn to pieces, but when a dino dies the violins begin and the female lead trots around a dinosaur paddock in 6 inch heels and a cream suit, suitably panting and puffing, chest rising, falling, splayed on the ground, all vulnerable and waiting... I was wishing so hard that the Rex would eat her... it might have saved the entire load of nonsense.The usual totally stupid script, but at least the first movie was original, the second annoying and the third intriguing... this movie is just terrible repeat, repeat, repeat... gosh, even down to a cell phone incident... wow... not a single original moment, the usual interchangeable Hollywood actors that I'll never remember and loads and loads of stupidity and artifice. Garbage. The one redeeming feature is for about 5 seconds you get to see astoundingly beautiful nature. First time I've loathed Vincent D'Onofrio and I never thought I'd say that. The other actors could have been pulled straight out of Days of our Lives, complete with faces that did not move a muscle, even when in a state of supposed terror. Who willingly makes this kind of utter trash? I hope this is the last one. Leave the dino's where they belong, in the past!Totally forgettable and moronic waste of time. Thank goodness I didn't pay for the DVD and thank goodness I borrowed it and was able to give it back, flying across the room.\",\n",
       " \"I am giving this title a 1 in an attempt to bring down the score that it does not currently deserve.This movie had its cool moments, but mostly just dumb.Way too many special effects and just unrealistic scenarios. e.g. At one point a woman in high heels is outrunning a T-rex. Remember in the original Jurrasic park the T-Rex was chasing down a Jeep at top speed!No spoilers but the ending is terrible and cheesy.Chris Pratt is pretty much just an extra in his own movie.It's a shame that it got so much hype that they are already planning the sequel. I am glad I got free cinema tickets when I saw this and didn't pay any money.\",\n",
       " \"The emergence of another 'Jurassic Park' sequel after the failure of 'Jurassic Park III' was bound to open the movie to criticism as exploring the world of dinosaurs seems to have been exhausted. However 'Jurassic World' doesn't try to be anything new, in fact it goes back to the original movie and adds on a few tasty elements. The film is set twenty two years after the original park was closed down after the disastrous events, and an Indian tycoon has now invested in a bigger and better park. However events take a disastrous turn once again due to genetically created experiments that are taking place behind the scenes. The story is good but not too inventive and the action sequences are breath-taking, whereas predictably some of the characters are abit two dimensional. The film is huge and highly enjoyable whether you are a fan of 'Jurassic Park' movies or not, this is old fashioned mayhem. In fact it is much better then the highly rated 'Godzilla' movie from 2014, which never got going. Jurassic World does what a great sequel should do, which is to take what the original had and change a few things while adding on a few sub-plots. Take the family and settle down to a a couple of hours of summer movie fun!\",\n",
       " 'As a young boy, dinosaurs were the greatest thing on earth (well, the greatest thing that once WAS on earth) for me. I knew most of their names (like Gray in JW) and had my plastic dinosaurs fighting themselves, evil, and sometimes also good. You can imagine my excitement when I first saw Jurassic Park and I was truly blown away by the idea. I still somehow wish that I could actually experience the events in the movie, although I understand the critic that the author of the novel, Michael Crichton, wanted to express. Much of that critic is lost in the third sequel to the original movie, 22 years after its original release, at least it\\'s hidden very deep in the plot. The scientists have created a new super- species, filled the missing pieces of DNA up with genes of amphibians that all have certain survival-powers, and it all goes terribly wrong, much because the dinosaurs are being underestimated as they always were. So is it a reboot of the first movie? At least a bit. They are referring to the first movie all the time, examples: A control guy wearing an Jurassic Park shirt proudly says he got an original shirt (shown in part 1 several times) for $150 from eBay, they run through degenerated original buildings and one time the kids even drive an original van that they repaired competently. New park-owner Masrani says that John Hammond told him on his death bed to \"spare no expense\", which was one of the funniest scenes in the movie, yet Masrani doesn\\'t want to commercialize the park too much. That\\'s where the movie starts being perfectly self-ironic: one control guy (the one with the classic shirt) jokingly suggests, in order to please the investors, to name newly bred species after companies, \"so how about Pepsi-Saurus\"? The movie indeed is full of product placements, I counted at least 9 brands and logos that are shown or mentioned during the film. So what is the purpose of the movie? Mainly, I guess, it\\'s meant as a nostalgic, yet up-to-date experience/excuse for all those fans who were bitterly disappointed by the Parts II&III. It\\'s exciting, contains a little love story, it\\'s got wit, social criticism and excellently animated dinosaurs. It shows that 22 years after Jurassic Park, movie heroes are still being chauvinist and women are still stronger and braver as they are pictured in most (other) movies. And, finally, it fulfills every fans biggest desire: man and dinosaur, at last fighting side by side. That\\'s probably why I\\'d give it an even better rating than the original Jurassic Park movie, although of course classic scenes like the shaking water glass will probably never be outperformed. Résumé: Director Colin Trevorrow manages to create an enthralling and visually stunning homage to the original which at some points brilliantly steps out of the shadow of its role model and finally puts the conciliatory end to the dinosaur universe that we, the fans, truly deserved.',\n",
       " 'Crazy review title right? Well you might agree after watching this movie.You\\'ll probably hear a lot of opinions from people who aren\\'t homegrown Godzilla fans - and they will have their own thoughts on this.\\nI, on the other hand, am a big fan of the monster going years back. Finding a Godzilla movie in the TV guide, or a DVD for one of the Toho movies to rent was like winning the lottery when my brother and I were young.Here are my thoughts plainly stated: Yes, this is a better Godzilla film than the 2014 movie. There are *aspects* of the latter that some might say make it superior, but that would only make it a better movie in general - as a *Godzilla movie* this new one is quite a bit better.Don\\'t listen to the people on RottenTomatoes talking about how \"the special effects are overly relied on and can\\'t make up for the bad characters and plot.\"\\nNo. Those CG monsters are the best part, and they almost singlehandedly save this movie. The solution is not to focus less on special effects and develop the characters better. The solution is to have every human character stepped on in the second act and have the last 45 min center the story solely on the monsters - which I guess would mostly be fighting.The problem is this does not happen. Every moment you see the monsters battle, you enter a brief moment of bliss before you are ripped away to deal with people you don\\'t care about doing things you hope they fail at. The first \"clash\" occurs in Antarctica, and that scene was actually quite good despite the focus on the humans. You\\'re just now being exposed to these titans duking it out, so having people there witnessing the madness and trying to escape help play into how incredible this event truly is.By the 3rd act, however, this tolerance has dried up. Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but doesn\\'t a movie titled \"Godzilla\" imply that he is the main character? Because he doesn\\'t feel like one. Without a doubt, THE biggest problem that Godzilla (2014) and this film have is they place waaayyyy too much value on human beings. Everyone in the audience is waiting for them to shut up and go away, but the movie has its head up its ass and thinks what they\\'re doing is somehow important and worth focusing on. It would be like two warriors facing off, and having most of the climax focusing on ants running around on the ground trying to save each other.The only \"characters\" here that need development are the Kaijus. Have them be your stars. Have them be the focus. It doesn\\'t just have to be mindless action like how snobby people will pretend that\\'s all we want to see. Go ahead and tell a story, but NOT with people. They are not the reason we\\'re watching this, and we don\\'t care about them.One exception to what I said in the previous paragraph: Ken Watanabe\\nHis big character moment was incredible. If you must have human beings involved, do them like this. He was amazing.',\n",
       " \"Right from being a child and watching the Hana Barbera cartoons and stomping round the house pretending to be Godzilla, to being allowed to stay up till the early hours of the morning as a treat by my Dad to watch the Togo films on channel 4 here here in the UK I have loved Godzilla. How I wish he was still here today to have watched this glorious film with me.Baffled by many of the reviews saying to much Kaiju action or poor director etc.This film was clearly made by a dedicated and passionate Godzilla fan. The sheer amount of Easter eggs and fan service which had me grinning is incredible, (yet knowledgeable Godzilla fans on RT seem to not have noticed any of this) and talk about the likes of fire breathing dragons ><!Anyway the film is awesome. One of my favourite films of all time. Definitely my favourite Godzilla film.The effects are incredible.The music is awesome. You will be grinning from ear to ear at certain points.I actually like the human cast. I liked 2014 Godzilla but did not like the main cast Aaron Tailor Johnson. Did not have those issues here. They play imo a good supporting cast to the main cast you care about - The Titans :)!I'm super excited to see what happens next in the monsterverse.Make sure you stay till the VERY end of the credits scene or for a final scene hinting at wha could be to come ;)!I would also encourage you to write a review also should you watch and enjoy the film. Let's not let the likes of Rotten Tomatoes deter people from seeing a very fun and entertaining Godzilla movie :)!\",\n",
       " 'Four monsters, two hours, one planet, a lot of fight scenes. I won\\'t blame anyone for jumping at the chance to see this film, and it does deliver exactly what it advertises. That would normally set the right mindset for an experience like this. Unfortunately, the movie is both painfully straightforward while subverting expectations in a highly unsatisfying fashion. But instead of making another joke at The Last Jedi\\'s expense, let\\'s look at Godzilla: King of the MonstersGodzilla: King of the Monsters stars Raymond Burr as reporter Steve Martin, as he investigates sightings of a behemoth that has attacked ships off the coast of JapanWait, that\\'s the wrong movieGodzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) is about ancient monsters awakening around the world, while the military and an organization known as Monarch try to handle the damage caused by these giant animals. As the enormous creatures start vying for supremacy against each other, humanity finds itself in the crossfire as the planet\\'s largest battle for dominance is reignitedOr at least, this is what the story attempts, but \"attempts\" might be too generous. To say the movie crashes while flying its premise would imply it took off the ground at some point, but even three aerial monsters in the film didn\\'t let it happen. The earliest sign of trouble with this story appears when the first of these titans rears its head and its features are barely noticeableThe decision to obscure these giant animals unfortunately extends to the territory battles between them. The fights are spaced far apart enough to not overwhelm the audience, but frequent enough to continue the thunderous footsteps. Unfortunately, on top of the behemoths being obscured by rain, snow, clouds, or smoke, the \"camera\" work involved with these CGI creations is close and chaotic to the point of being nearly indiscernible. There\\'s rarely a steady point of reference to sell the size of these titans, and the \"color\" filter with their scenes only serves to hide them further even in plain sightWhat stands out the most about these monsters is the sound design, both the roaring movements and their musical motifs. The roars of the giant animals are excellently powerful, frantic, majestic, and threatening to match the titan. The vibrations of the tremors and trails from the wake of these behemoths emphasize their size and being where the visual framing does not. But by far the audio highlight in the best way possible are the creature\\'s themes. Beautifully crafted masterpieces that invoke a sense of history from these ancient beings, while constructing a mythology and presence to reflect the nature of these leviathans. The extraordinary amount of care in this score is absolutely haunting, and by far the best part of the movieIt makes it all the more confusing that the film doesn\\'t shut up. The fight scenes are spread out, but most of the space between them is intent on using loud tracks even when nothing cinematic is happening. Here would be a great time for the movie to let the audience catch its breath after its taken it away. It doesn\\'t give time for the spectacle to settle, not for the frequency of the setpieces, but for the barely noticeable difference in \"volume\" between downtime and destruction time. The film wants to retain the viewer\\'s excitement when the monsters are not on-screen (if they were even visible in the first place), but instead comes across as auditory hijacking. It overcompensates for itself and comes across as lacking confidence because of itThe most damning thing of all, however, are the human characters. If the monsters\\' presence is bombarded by inconsistent audiovisuals, then it\\'s left in a heap by the infuriating human characters, and not because of military firepower either. Amidst the miscellaneous soldiers and scientists running about the story, are three thruline characters throughout the plot. One lacks purpose and personality in favor of being an audience surrogate. One is hyper-competent to a degree so as to nearly invalidate everyone else. One displays motivations that make less than no sense. And all of them are connected by tragedy via destruction from these behemothsThe dramatic thrust shared by these three characters is decimated by how poorly written they are. This is not okay. In 1954, there was a monster movie which had characters genuinely fearful both of the monster, and the consequences of what may happen should they take a certain step to destroy that monster. In 1989, there was a monster movie where a scientist was desperate to bring his deceased daughter back to life, only for it to backfire horribly. In 2004, there was a monster movie where the main hero\\'s journey paralleled that of a monster fighting against an alien invasionThose films are Gojira, Godzilla vs Biollante, and Godzilla: Final Wars. They are different in tone from one another, but share in common a strong enough human element that contextualizes the sweeping spectacle of 50 meter, 80 meter, or 100 meter tall titans. Without that human anchor, action scenes featuring these giant animals can only carry a film so far before becoming boring. Not cheesy. Boring. This is even assuming the set pieces are compelling on their own in the first placeThis movie hurts. Even if the human characters were unremarkable, there\\'s a baseline here that should have been highly entertaining for two hours. But not only are the human characters just milquetoast, they are aggressively aggravating. And the creature spectacle itself becomes tiring because of how haphazardly it\\'s crafted. This film isn\\'t painful because it could have been great, it hurts because there\\'s a lot of care undermined by incompetence. It knows how to pace itself for breathers but doesn\\'t let its downtime do what it needs to. It would have masterful sound design if it didn\\'t insist on being loud all the time to the point certain music pieces can\\'t shine through. The monsters themselves look great when they\\'re not obstructed from view, while the roars and sounds from these giant animals project a lot of personalityThis film should have been an atomic blast but was instead a nuclear meltdown. After the studio behind this movie released two very solid monster films in 2014 and 2017, what should have been a three-peat didn\\'t happen. The expectations on this movie weren\\'t even the highest, because the monster films from 2014 and 2017 still had noticeable flaws themselves. Even carrying that tempered anticipation, this movie still hurts. I don\\'t drink, but maybe Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) would be a better time if I wasn\\'t sober',\n",
       " 'I dig monster movies. I love the concept of massive creatures that dwarf us.

Where are the good story tellers in Hollywood?!The Good:\\n1. Soundtrack\\n2. Sound Editing\\n3. Last minute of the final battle.The OK:\\n1. Monster design - Nothing spectacular. Especially did not like the design of the main antagonist. Seemed less organic and more of direct attempt to copy a certain design of a certain mythological beast.\\n2. Cinematography - Nothing new here. Broad sweeps of large areas and landscape, etc.\\n3. The conclusion.The Bad:\\n1. Side characters: Seems like the only reason most the side characters to exist was to fill a diversity and gender quota, to pay lip service to current trends. Just give them a few scenes with some dialogue and voila! Job done!\\n2. Obligatory side characters: \"Hey, we don\\'t have a wise cracking guy...\" - Points randomly at a guy \" You be that guy. And be a .. I don\\'t know...lead scientist. To justify your role.\"\\n3. Dialogue: From the one liners to the nonsensical reactionary conversations, all seem to be very childish with little thought put into it.\\n4. Main characters: I like some of the actors, but the source material and direction was bad enough to make them seem poor at their jobs.\\n5. Obligatory roles: It\\'s like the screenwriter/director had a checklist of things needed to do: Gender diversity. Check. Ethnic diversity. Check. Noble sacrificial situation/character. Check. Main character in bad situation to be saved. Check. Etc. Not the worst checklist, but even that didn\\'t help.The Horrible:\\n1. Character motivations: Nonsensical, poorly portrayed and explained. And the decisions the supposedly intelligent people make are clearly not people with common sense do. Which leads to the next point.\\n2. Character Settings: The way this movie was likely made. The director/screenwriter wanted to create a tense situation. Doesn\\'t matter if it makes logical sense for the actors involved, make them do stupid things, create an artificially charged situation, and then let them constantly survive again and again when they should have died in the first instance. Want to make us care for the main characters? Same modus operandi.The Unforgivable:\\n1. Contrivance: If there was ever a category at the Oscars for Contrivance, this movie would get it. If there was ever a Nobel Prize category for Contrivance this would win it! It\\'s that bad. Right from the very first scene , till the end. It keeps getting hammered into the audiences face again and again and again!Honestly, it seemed like the movie was written/directed by a young child who doesn\\'t exactly understand the basic elements of story telling. I didn\\'t care for any of the characters, even those portrayed by actors I like! Even the few monster battles felt unepic for the most part, and dragged on. The main characters getting into impossibly dangerous situations like idiots, and surviving when they shouldn\\'t have. Again and again and again.Never again will I watch a movie made by this director and screenwriter. I can do without the torture. Please don\\'t suffer like I did!',\n",

       " 'For over 25 years now, I have cited Blade Runner as my favorite movie of all time. After seeing Watchmen, I may have to reconsider.First, I\\'m glad I went to see the movie alone. I\\'ve heard so many comments focused on a blue dick, or the length of the movie, or some other such nonsense, that I\\'m sure watching it with someone would have been a constant barrage of commentary and complaint. And no, that\\'s not Javier Bardem. Yes, the movie is long; nearly three hours. But, unlike the dreadfully insipid Titanic, at the end of this movie I wasn\\'t asking for those three hours of my life back. And, as with all such movies, you must be able to look beyond the literal.Watchmen is iconic and iconoclastic, deconstructionist and revisionist, laden with allegory and allusion. Consider, for example, the character Ozymandias. I\\'m wondering how many people who viewed the film ever even heard of Percy Bysshe Shelley\\'s poem by the same name. The character even quotes the poem on a plinth in his Antarctic lair. The allusion is amazing. Here\\'s the full quote;And on the pedestal these words appear -- \"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\" Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.\\'Clearly one must see the allusion to the work, in this case, of a superhero who hopes to leave mankind a lasting legacy, but realizes in the back of his mind that everything is eventually lost in time. Ozymandias was the first poem I ever examined from an expositional point of view, and I was blown away. The use of it in this movie is equally impactful.Then there is Dr. Manhattan, named, of course, for the Manhattan Project, which yielded the atomic bomb. His character is an allegory for God, and his relationship with man mirrors the apparent detachment with which God sees suffering in the world He created. The deity reference is reinforced often, and one thinks of Oppenheimer\\'s citation of the Bhagavad-Gita, in which Vishnu takes on a godly form and says, \"Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\"In an expository scene in the second act, Dr. Manhattan has a sort of recollection of his life. His account is dizzyingly elliptical, since he does not see time as linear the way others do. This scene has the lyrical feel of my favorite piece of fiction, Alan Lightman\\'s almost unbearably beautiful Einstein\\'s Dreams, and the reference to Einstein cannot be ignored.But the real beauty of Watchmen is the moral diversity of its superheroes. Each is flawed in different ways, allowing us to inhabit different ethical perspectives, intellectually at least, and witness their consequences. Everything from Rorshach\\'s refusal to compromise, which makes him a doomed fugitive, to the ultimate compromise envisioned by Ozymandias, who can dispassionately evaluate scenarios where millions of lives are sacrificed, calls into question our most cherished beliefs. Where does it leave you? Well, that\\'s for you to decide.From a purely entertainment perspective, Watchmen is stunning. The visuals are state of the art, and do not suffer from the sort of mental rejection I have for some movies that present too many special effects to swallow at once as reality. And Watchmen doesn\\'t suffer from Hollywood\\'s apparent fascination with camp in comic book movies. Camp works to some degree in Spiderman, since he\\'s a somewhat humorous character to begin with. But the excess of camp rendered the Fantastic Four sequel unwatchable. Watchman proves that superheroes can use more subtle forms of humor, such as irony, without devolving into camp for cheap laughs.And the music, oh, the music. If you didn\\'t grow up in the 60\\'s and 70\\'s, you will surely miss some of the impact, but don\\'t worry. Even a second hand recollection of such iconic tunes will suffice. I am reminded of the painfully awful Across the Universe, which couldn\\'t even pull together a decent movie built around the greatest catalog in modern music. Watchmen does it in spades.I LOL\\'d, I cried. The people in the theatre applauded at the end. I vowed to wait 24 hours before writing a review to see if my euphoria passed. It hasn\\'t.',\n",
       " \"Firstly, I have not read the graphic novel. This was deliberate, since I knew there was going to be a movie, and reading any book tends to ruin the movie. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of things in the graphic novel that they left out or changed, and it's hard for those who have read it to imagine how people could understand the subtleties of the story without it. But trust me, the morally complex, multi-layered characters and plot were very well delivered by the movie alone. There was nothing that seemed like it didn't make sense or wasn't quite explained. The movie was just about perfect.I'm surprised to hear a lot of reviews saying that this is just an action movie for teenage boys; I thought quite the opposite. There was much less action than I expected, the movie centered mostly on emotions and ideas conveyed through dialog, narration and character flashbacks. The action scenes were all fairly short, though when there was action it was delightfully innovative. There were a lot of nasty and unexpected twists like limbs snapping, guts sticking to the ceiling, bones audibly crunching... Every time something violent happened, they made it interesting and shocking rather than recreating the generic ho-hum violence of every other movie. (And there was no obligatory 30-minute-long final action scene culminating in the conclusion of the plot... oh joy! Those get so boring.) Plus, many of the scenes were rather bold for a mainstream film, and showed certain things that are normally hidden off-screen or completely avoided. The only example I feel I can give without spoiling anything is the full frontal male nudity, something that is rather conspicuously hidden in almost every Hollywood movie. This movie isn't concerned about hiding little things like that, just as it isn't concerned about hiding certain subjects that most movies wouldn't show.This movie definitely isn't for everyone. People expecting another Dark Knight will be disappointed (or, as in my case, thrilled), as this movie is completely unique. People who want an action movie and don't want all that talking and thinking will be disappointed. But to those looking for a long, complicated, deeply moving epic that will really make them think about the very concepts of right, wrong, and heroism (and who haven't read the book, which based on other reviews seems to ruin it): Do NOT miss this movie!\",\n",
       " \"A short warning first. You may like action-packed toy/game inspired or superhero movies, like Transformers or X-Man, where the action has priority over message - or there is no message at all. Do not be alarmed if it is true, there is nothing wrong with you. It simply indicates most probably you will not enjoy Watchmen. Stop reading and look somewhere else. Otherwise, please continue.I begun to learn English reading comics, Superman, Spiderman, Batman, X-Men and FF later. But that was more than 40 years ago, when I was young. Therefore, I had never heard about Watchman phenomenon, until I bought a DVD with the theatrical version. Then it begun. I saw the complete movie several times day after day. I became obsessed by its characters and themes. I put away my work for a few days, doing research on the Internet. I found out the movie is controversial for many. Not for me. It is a true masterpiece of a rare kind, something much more than a sum of all its ingredients. All parts fit together, while every part makes others stronger.The story is fascinating, the characters are psychologically rich, complex and morally ambiguous. If you look deeper, you find lots of disturbing and sometimes unanswered questions about politics, people and societies. Some of those questions flow from the movie's motto. Who watched President Bush when he launched the Iraqi war, to finish the job his father did not ? Who watched Israeli Cabinet, when it launched the Gaza Offensive to improve its poll ratings ahead of elections ? Who watches Iranian Ayatollahs and their dreams to create a new Persian Empire, no matter what ? Equally intriguing are questions about the human nature. Are dictators, who sacrifice millions so easily, driven by their lust for power or by a dream of ideal societies envisioned for their nations ? Do they truly believe in their utopias ? What is really behind brutality and trigger-happiness of some of the law enforcement officials ? Do they loose control or enjoy their work too much ? Why some people prefer death to avoid betrayal of their values ? Am I ready to do that ? These are some of the questions I ask myself, but there are much more from different perspectives. This movie makes you think hard about the world around.Acting is from satisfactory to very good. The best actor is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Should get Oscar Nomination. However, I found Jeffrey Dean Morgan, The Comedian, as the most charismatic. He steals every scene he is in. As for the music, the original motion picture score is good, but it is the incidental music I applaud. The opening sequence, the funeral and Dr. Manhattan's Mars monologue are the most powerful scenes in the movie and the music is responsible for such impact. Bob Dylan is a songwriting genius and The Times They Are A-Changin' is a perfect background. The Sound of Silence illustrates introductory funeral images in an unforgettable way. As for Dr. Manhattan's Mars monologue, music written by Philip Glass is a brilliant choice - particularly as the laboratory where he gains his superpowers is run by Professor Glass. And then comes All Along The Watchtower, one of my all-time favorites. I will recall the related movie scene every time I hear it till I die.Some question the 99 Luftballons as the right choice, but not me. The decision to use it converted the accompanied scene into a small jewel. I raised the eyebrow only once, when I heard Hallelujah. After the second Watchman watch it dropped down however.Needless to say, I ordered the novel immediately after my first Watchmen watch. I just completed my first reading and it is certainly not the last one. I had never read a graphic novel before and I am happy it was the first one. Now, it is the interaction between Watchmen The Novel and The Movie which makes my amazement and impression so deep and lasting. Watchmen The Novel fills some of the gaps and provides more context for many scenes. Watchmen The Movie enriches the pictures and texts. For me, both are perfectly complementary.It seems most of the critics sided with Alan Moore, who stated Watchmen The Novel cannot be translated into a movie. That is the writer's right. But if a movie critic does not judge the movie as such, but how well - or not well - the book was adopted, then he or she should take care of the books. Movies should be judged on their own and Watchmen is a true masterpiece as a standalone work. But even if the book is taken into account, the adaptation is at least very good in my view. The changes, omissions and additions make sense because of the time frame and other factors, Zack Snyder's style included. I understand some of the fans of the book were disappointed by simplifications and the end in particular. Let us be serious, shall we ? Watchmen story takes place on an alternate Earth, right ? Think of The Movie and The Novel as parallel worlds that overlap mostly and differ in some respects. Such worlds can happily coexist together, as an extension of the original Watchman concept. If we accept imaginary worlds, why there should be only one ?The movie has some tiny flaws, but they disappear without a trace when you look at the whole. Watchman The Movie would not be so great without Watchman The Novel. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons created a masterpiece in a graphical form. Zack Snyder turned it into a movie masterpiece. If you are still with me, see Watchmen The Movie and you should enjoy it as I did, do and will. It is not too late. Never has been, never will be too late for that.\",\n",
       " 'It is 1985, Richard Nixon is serving his fifth term as US president and the world stands on the brink of destruction as the world\\'s two superpowers vie for nuclear supremacy. The only thing stopping the USSR from launching a doomsday attack is America\\'s Dr Manhattan \\x96 a being with enough power to destroy planets and much else besides.Wow! I was lucky enough to watch this at a preview screening in London last night and came to the film with little knowledge about what to expect. Having seen the posters around the place and perhaps catching one or two of the trailers I was expecting something akin to another \"X-Men\" movie (which frankly I\\'ve never found particularly interesting). However, it was a very pleasant surprise to find that Zack Snyder has served up something entirely fresh and quite dazzling. Watchmen takes the well-worn superhero format and turns it on its head. As you would expect from a movie of this genre you get a tale of attempted world domination by evil baddies, good guys wearing latex costumes, fistfuls of action and spectacular special effects. What you would not expect is to have this interwoven with eye-watering violence (a scene where one particularly nasty bad guy gets a meat cleaver brought down on his forehead being one example), full frontal male nudity (albeit computer generated) and rampant satire. The US political system, military posturing and blind patriotism are all given a bit of a roasting by David Hayter and Alex Tse\\'s script. Add to this a host of compelling performances, notably Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, and you have an exceptional cinematic experience.Watchmen is no ordinary superhero movie and likely to manage the difficult feat of satisfying both the fan-boys and the uninitiated punters (like myself). Its success means it must be highly likely that there will be a sequel \\x96 if not several. Catch this early if you can and be one of the first to witness that rarefied thing in cinema \\x96 something beautiful, exciting and original.',\n",
       " \"Amazing film. Bringing a graphic novel as layered and complex as the Watchmen to the screen is no easy task and Snyder did a brilliant job. Watchmen was as unconventional, intellectual, cerebral, and unique to the cinema world as much as the graphic novel was to the comic book world. It's hard to not compare this to the novel but as a film it is brilliant. Zack Snyder truly did the story justice. Look around online at where other filmmakers before him wanted to take the film. There was even one script where they updated it to be in present day and have the threat be from terrorists. Snyder single handedly saved the Watchmen from a cinematic nightmare. He had the script reworked into the closest adaptation of any graphic novel to date. I would like to shake his hand and thank him for being one of the few filmmakers these days that actually cares about being faithful to the source material of film adaptations. Beyond being faithful, Snyder brought an amazing style and vision to the project. He brought an independent film sensibility to a big budget picture which not many people have the guts to do. I don't think enough can be said on what a great job he did. I think some of the complaints people have about this movie is interesting because they are very contradictory. Some say the film is too short and some say it's too long. Some say that the movie suffers from sticking too close to the book and others say it's from not sticking close enough to the book. From beginning to end I can't say there wasn't a single moment when I checked the time. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this film. I also speak from a fan's perspective when I say that this movie is probably the closest adaptation of a comic book to date. Yeah there are some details left out but there are already people complaining about the length. Imagine how many people would complain if this movie actually had every single thing from the book in it. It would be like five hours long! The fact of the matter is that the spirit and the heart of the book is definitely present in every moment of the movie.Some people are also complaining about the music used in the film. With exception of maybe a song or two I loved the soundtrack. Since the film is a period piece, and these characters are such a big part of American history from the 1950's on, it makes sense to blend the music of the times into these characters lives. This is the story of what would happen in our world if these characters existed in it. In our world music is very tied into our history. I just really don't see the big deal. I think it's just because people aren't used to hearing this sort of music in this genera. Again this just goes to show that this movie dares to be different from the rest. I think the problem for the non fans of the book is that they just thought this was going to be another X Men. THIS IS NOT THE X MEN or is it any other super hero film you have ever seen before. This is risk taking super hero story. It's got the spirit of an independent film. It is truly unique. I saw some parents brought children to see this film. Wow great parenting. This isn't a movie for children. It has extremely graphic and gruesome violence. It has sex and nudity. Watchmen earns it's R rating. Yeah it still has the action and the fight scenes audiences have come to expect from a super hero movie and they are certainly impressive. Unlike other super hero films though the action scenes aren't what drives the story. This is a character piece. The film, like the novel, takes it's time developing the complex history of the characters and the world they live in. Each character is so rich and unique that it's very hard to find a favorite. The actors are perfectly cast to bring these characters to life. It's as though they are jumping out of the pages of the book. Watchmen is definitely under appreciated and under rated. It's a shame that mainstream audiences didn't really seem to get it. Then again these are the same people that made Transformers 2 one of the biggest hits of the summer so it's almost a compliment that they didn't get it. Like Fight Club, Donnie Darko, and The Fountain, Watchmen will find attention from a more intellectual group of people that can actually appreciate all of the nuances, philosophy, and social commentary that this film has to offer. Apparently this is too smart and cerebral for the typical audience member. Watchmen dared to be different in a time when most films are afraid to challenge conventions. Films used to be praised for that. Apparently not any more. If this came out ten years ago it probably would have met more success but these days people don't want to think at the movies. They just want conventional and simple. It's a shame but I have a feeling that Watchmen will find a larger audience on DVD. It is an experience that should not be missed. It's the freshest super hero story ever told.\",\n",
       " 'With 300, Zack Snyder had the problem of having not enough meat on the bone - Frank Miller\\'s violent graphic novel was short and in-your-face, with director Snyder compensating by spending pretty much all of it\\'s two hour runtime in super-slow motion. Here the problem is reversed: Alan Moore\\'s unfilmable, complicated and very, very deep graphic novel seemed simply too dense for any director to take by the horns and be successful. Hell, even Moore himself deemed it so - so much that he disowned the film entirely.Here, Snyder has two audiences: those familiar, and those who aren\\'t. If you\\'re the latter, Watchmen is a masterwork of literature, telling the story of a group of masked avengers who, since outlawed, live empty and lonely lives. When one is killed in his apartment, Rorschach, who dons the famous ever-moving mask, takes it upon himself to get to the root of the real reason for the death, but stumbles onto something much larger than he could ever have expected.It really is a character piece. Each one, filled off-screen with complicated, articulate back-stories is brought to life on screen by some of the most heartfelt acting I\\'ve seen in a long time (save perhaps Malin Ackerman as the latex-wearing Silk Spectre II), particularly from Billy Crudup who plays the blue, often naked (and well-hung) demi-god who is the only superhero with real superpowers.Although the star of the show is Rorschach himself. Despite being behind a mask for the large majority of the film, Jackie Earle Haley is beyond perfect for the role. His husky voice commands the voiceovers from Rorschach\\'s journal (recited in many cases word-for-word from the novel), and plays the psychopathic, paranoid and immensely complex role with such a force that you simply can\\'t tear your eyes away from him.Snyder made himself known with 300 - the ultra-violent story of the Spartans who went to war (and lost\\x85 miserably). However, Watchmen makes 300 seem like Mary Poppins - this has got to be one of the most violent films I have ever seen. All the book\\'s action sequences are there, just\\x85 bigger. More badass. Gory as hell. And, for some reason Snyder decided to place a porny, cringy 3 minute sex scene set to Leonard Cohen\\'s \"Hallelujah\" slap bang in the middle of the film. Sure, it was in the book, but it was shorter, and the soundtrack was most certainly not this poncy.However, this\\x85 discrepancy\\x85 is the only gripe (and this is a very minor gripe) that I have with the film. It\\'s hard to watch in places - a rape scene here, a pregnant woman killed there - and even pulls the heartstrings in others (Doctor Manhattan\\'s backstory most definitely (almost) brought me to tears). The book is majorly complex, deep and meaningful, and in it\\'s transition to screen, a lot of that is lost in translation. But what we get is a fantastically artistic, fast-paced action epic. Snyder was aiming for two audiences who are polar opposites, and comes free with an adaptation of which even writer Alan Moore should be proud.',\n",

Today a friend of mine has told me that \"Watchmen\" is a great movie and I have decided to give a second chance to this film, and I found really an excellent bleak and Machiavellian story, supported by magnificent landscapes and CGI.

       " \"I was able to watch Baby Driver during an advanced screening last week and and yes it's as amazing as the critics say it is. The way it uses the music is just so great. It's so different from all the other movies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it: this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hard to please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this. And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he was about this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also serious when it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll be honest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the second time I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theaters I would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, it reminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want to punch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality I think it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it's definitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't want to overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is my favorite Edgar Wright movie. I'll be shocked if this doesn't appear on many 'Best of the Year' lists in December, at least I already know it'll be on mine.\",\n",
       " \"I read an early tweet that described Baby Driver as 'a mix-tape with a film attached to it' and that proved to be an accurate comment. The tweeter may have thought this was a good thing, but I certainly don't.Yes, there are some good tracks and the action sequences are elaborate and frenetic (a little too frenetic, actually), but the characters are dull, unlikeable and bear very little relation to the real world. I simply did not believe in them, especially Darling, the sassy, kick ass stock character that only a fool would consider to be a strong female character.Then there's Baby, whose laconic, boyish demeanour makes him a rather uninspiring protagonist. His romance with Debbie, a cute little waitress, is yawn-inducingly clichéd, too.If you want a stylish heist film that isn't so bloody try-hard, then watch Drive. It's an exercise of style over substance much like this film, but it has suspense, atmosphere and characters that could actually exist rather than blaring music, mind-numbing action and flat, hateful comic book characters.\",\n",
       " 'Edgar Wright remains one of my all-time favourite directors. Why? Because each and every film he crafts reeks of originality, he takes a few similar traits, throws them together, delves down a completely unexpected route and forms something unique, something masterful. From \\'Shaun of the Dead\\' to \\'Hot Fuzz\\' and so on and so forth, each film feels like something you think you\\'ve witnessed before, but on a whole new level, something fresh, something alluring, packed with adrenaline... and of course, \\'Baby Driver\\' followed suit.\\'Baby Driver\\' is an utterly engrossing caper-comedy that is (in my personal opinion) the finest film to face 2017 so far, I couldn\\'t help but smile throughout, from the stunningly executed action scenes and stunts, through to the soundtrack (with an abundance of classic rock and soul tracks) and finally the heavily relatable characters. The lack of disappointment in Edgar Wright\\'s work continues with this masterful film, which is ultimately also one of the coolest films of the past decade or so.Many of the heist films of recent years have been rather disappointing when it comes to both story and technical achievement, however when something like \\'Baby Driver\\' makes an appearance, it\\'s refreshing to know that indie films are still taking this planet by storm and shunting the blockbusters out of the limelight. To know that certain production companies still trust the creativity of a director over the monetary expectations, and by doing so, unleashing a flurry of fantastic independently \"driven\" films.I\\'m gonna finish with this (partially odd) statement / testimonial... when I went to sleep last night, I had odd dreams of car chases and stunt driving to rock classics, and that is thanks to this film, the fact that it stuck with me even when I wasn\\'t fully conscious.

The way the music is used is impressive and fits naturally with events on screen, regardless of many of those events not being engaging enough to keep me from daydreaming about my personal life while the film plays on before me. The music hitting at the right time was really the only thing ripping me out of my own thoughts and back into the narrative.Those who are excited by car chases, sunglasses, trendy styles & simple dialogue need apply.

       " \"The execution and quality of the film making was great, but overall I quickly got bored watching this movie as none of the character's motivations seemed realistic or made sense to me. The action sequences were great, but didn't do anything especially unique or carry any suspenseful weight with the plot that I found myself yawning during much of it. Perhaps it needed more shocking gore.The movie seemed to be a bit confused in its tone, mixing stylized violence with comedy and serious heist elements. It was set in a realistic world, but the characters and their motivations were not. It felt like it was trying to rekindle the essence of a Tarantino cool bad guy heist film like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but missed the mark. I found myself not believing the heist scenarios enough or having enough of a stake in them. It needed a stronger overall macguffin.The use of Music was unique, but I would've have got more out of it if more obscure music was used, like what the GTA video game series does curating amazing forgotten B-side gems from famous artists.I felt like Jamie Foxx's acting talent was a bit wasted, and the bland Atlanta backdrop seemed like a production budget restraint. I wonder what city was written in the original script? I doubt anyone writes for Atlanta. Rather than transporting us to a cool city that feels lived in and feels like a real location, this just felt like a boring block of downtown brick buildings to shoot car chases and shootouts in.I love most of Edgar Wright's other films, so I'm not sure why this was so boring for me. It just didn't do anything new for me and will probably be forgotten from my film memory years from now.\",\n",
       " \"I may have been more generous with the rating I chose, however due to the overwhelming number of highly positive reviews, I feel that some brutal honesty is required here.The main themes in most of the reviews I've stumbled across are that this movie has a refreshingly original story and that the car chase scenes were exceptional. Neither circumstance holds true. The story was as cut and dry as any in this genre and the car chase scenes were bland, boring, and made no sense to me. Compared to a movie like Drive, where the protagonist's backstory actually lends to his driving skills (stunt car driver, motorsports participant), in Baby Driver, we're supposed to believe that some kid somehow acquired exceptional getaway driver abilities because of...tinnitus? There is no connection here, not to me anyway. And as for the chase scenes, utterly boring and unoriginal. The cars were completely lame too. Taking Drive as a point of contention again, the cars in Drive even have some degree of backstory to make the seemingly unbelievable chase scenes more believable...upgraded chassis, suspension, and souped up engines. In Baby Driver, we're given nothing more than showroom stock grocery getters...not even the top end models of the cars were chosen to take on the challenges. It was just all around stupid to me and I was left disappointed.OK so the soundtrack was good. But this is not Forrest Gump where a compelling, original story is amplified by a perfectly curated soundtrack. Instead, it's a collection of good music used in campy fashion. If what you're after is the soundtrack, get a Spotify account. Dollar for dollar you'll get a lot more out of it, I promise.\",\n",

Baby Driver was actually supposed to be. It had the potential to be a decent action movie but I was suspicious from the moment I saw it had 8.3 on here. I mean, what could have they done with this movie to deserve such a high rating? So, just in case, I lowered my expectations and, somehow, I still managed to be disappointed. Is it possible I am not seeing the originality and perfection of this movie that everyone keeps talking about?Let\\'s go over the good parts first. The soundtrack, of course. I was very pleased with the song choices and that alone has salvaged this movie from a tempting lower rating than 6/10. Then, the action. One could argue that is seemed forced in some cases, which is true, but overall, I can appreciate the bad-ass driving scenes and the well executed violent confrontations.Now it\\'s time for the cons. To begin with, I feel like this had the potential to be a great story and somehow it got boring before it even began. The relationship between Elgort\\'s (Baby) and Spacey\\'s (Doc) characters could have given some wind to the wings of this movie. Baby\\'s past could have done the same. I swear, there are so many things which could have been used to make some sense out of the story and out of the characters, but they just didn\\'t elaborate on anything well enough to interest the viewers. It\\'s like they wanted this movie to be so many different things that they ended up with a little bit of everything which amounted to nothing much when put together. Onto the girl. I just don\\'t find her character believable nor do I see any relevance of having her in the movie other that to slow down the pace of it. I could go on about all the things which were ridiculous about this love story, but then again, maybe I\\'m just too cynical to understand it. Next stop, Spacey and Foxx. Come. On. Guys. I adore both of them and I was hoping for either of them to be the highlight of this movie. They were not. It felt like Specey couldn\\'t be bothered to deliver a good performance. I was half expecting him to keyser soze his way out of it and turn the whole thing around and there was even a perfect moment to do so. And then nothing. Foxx didn\\'t do a bad job but this character of his was already used in Horrible bosses so I can\\'t give him much credit for it.The list really could go on for much longer. I don\\'t expect movies like this to have relatable characters nor a reality based storyline, but I do expect a level of consistency, which is something this movie is lacking big time. I enjoy when a movie has more than one thing to offer but this whole \"love story from a musical on one side and a serious, violent heist on the other\", is just not working in a way I find interesting.',\n",
       " \"I am someone who has enjoyed Edgar Wright's work immensely. In fact, Hot Fuzz is one of my all-time favorite comedies. So obviously, I went to this movie with high expectations, knowing how much he can deliver a good time at the movies. After seeing it, I can say he most certainly did, although some things did drag it down from it standing toe-to-toe with his best.First, the positives: the music direction is phenomenal. Nearly all the soundtrack utilizes a vast selection of music from the past 50 years, and it's clever in how it doesn't use super-overplayed songs (with a few intentional exceptions) and instead uses music most people have never heard before. This does a wonderful job of emphasizing Baby's encyclopedic love for music. How the film cuts with the music is truly a work of art. Each chase scene felt like a exciting, but focused rush I usually don't see in summer blockbusters. The main character, Baby, has a backstory and arc that feels completely natural. His decisions throughout the film make sense relative to his situation, and Ansel Elgort does a great job portraying both social awkwardness and focused training. Most of the other characters are funny as well. Although I do feel like they could have fleshed out some of them more, most of them do get the job done. It is a bit disappointing, however, considering that even some superhero films this year did a better job with building their characters. Jamie Foxx does a stand-out performance which bought out most of the laughs for me. Now for some drawbacks: the love interest fell completely flat for me. While Lily James' performance is solid, the material feels, well, a bit lacking. I felt they needed to better justify her and Baby's strong emotional bond. Since that spark isn't quite there, I ended up questioning why she played along with the events of the movie. That reason isn't quite given and it is distracting. Also, while the music is great, there are brief moments where they use a more traditional film score. If they wanted to show this bond Baby had with music, they should have completely immersed us in his ears, which they do, but in a couple scenes I felt as though they forgot or phoned it in. Silence can sometimes be as powerful as score, especially when it contrasts.Despite some gripes, I do think Wright has made another solid addition to his short, but impressive, library of work. I do recommend you see this one in the theater if you get the chance, because we all know the last thing we need is another Edgar Wright film to bomb at the box office.\",\n",
       " \"There is never a dull moment in this action crime film about a getaway driver who has his own unlimited getaway soundtrack but who also wants to break free from the crime boss who owns his life.There is enough style and visceral strut in this film that it neutralizes the one or two credibility gaps in the plot. Ansel Elgort is great as the title character, but Jamie Foxx steals the film with a lively performance as the loose cannon in the crew. Performances all around are solid and the dialogue is so rife with dueling wits, it's like watching a recurring display of verbal fireworks. These firecracker scenes of competitive criminals showing off their bravado are just as exciting as the chase scenes through downtown Atlanta.The film also banks heavily on a heady, omnipresent soundtrack that keeps the tempo perpetually hyperactive. A word of caution: The action can be tough going at times; the film revels in its permanent state of anarchy before ultimately developing a mean streak. But for all the blistering gunfire and screeching tires, this is not a one-note film. It has its moments of quietly boiling tension and eerie backstory flashbacks. It's a film that wears its attitude on its sleeve and doesn't shrivel into conventionality. Not an absolute bull's eye, but recommended to everyone who wants a good rush.\",\n",
       " \"It isn't easy to make a good fantasy film – as borne out by Seventh Son, which has suffered a particularly arduous journey to the silver screen. Originally slated for release in February 2013, its visual effects house went bankrupt and its studio, Legendary Pictures, parted ways with distributor Warner Bros. The film that's finally stumbling into cinemas almost two full years later (courtesy of Universal Pictures) should be an unmitigated disaster. Surprisingly, it's not. The film isn't exactly great, but it's a largely entertaining romp that's more inspired by than strictly faithful to Joseph Delaney's series of bestselling books.Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) is the seventh son of a seventh son: a rare genetic lineage that sets him on the path to becoming a Spook a.k.a., a slayer of the myriad evil creatures that haunt the land. He becomes the apprentice of grizzled, alcohol-addled John Gregory (Jeff Bridges), shortly after Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore), an evil witch, escapes her earthly prison to claim the world as her own. With only a week to go before the blood moon rises, Tom trains with Gregory but finds himself distracted by the charms of Alice (Alicia Vikander) – a mysterious young lady with a few secrets of her own.While hardly groundbreaking in any way, the story unfolds with unexpected punch. Tom's story – one in which he comes of age and comes into his own – is accompanied by plenty of action sequences, courtesy of bone-crunching battles between men and other men (and women) who turn into soaring, swooping, fire-breathing dragons. Tom tumbles over a cliff to avoid a pursuing monster, Gregory battles a gigantic bear, and wraiths of smoke and despair trail after the Spook and his apprentice as they make their way through a dark, brooding forest.It helps, too, that the film is leavened by a welcome bite of humour. Seventh Son doesn't take itself as deadly seriously as some of its brethren in the fantasy genre do. That's why Gregory plunges into a bar brawl armed with nothing more than his flagon of beer, and Tom is allowed to make quite a few cutting remarks about his purported mentor that are heartily returned with interest.Ardent fans of Delaney's books should be warned: Seventh Son riffs on elements of the novels rather than staying strictly true to them. For one thing, Tom is considerably older in the film. Most noticeably, Malkin is a very different character than she is on the page. She's given more depth and complexity here, her vile behaviour explained, if not strictly justified by, her past entanglements with Gregory. It's actually quite nice to see a fantasy world that doesn't simply perpetuate the trope of the wicked witch, but instead dreams up characters that fall along a broad spectrum of morality.Barnes is well-cast as Tom, holding his own as both a hero and quasi-romantic lead. He shares a sweet, though not particularly electric, chemistry with Vikander who is, thankfully, called upon to do more than simper and flirt. But there are considerably more thrills to be had with Bridges, who manages to fold charm, menace and darkness into Gregory; and Moore, who's clearly having plenty of fun cutting her way through scenes as a whirlwind of madness and malevolence.By all accounts, Seventh Son should really have been an outright flop. It may still play as such to any fantasy aficionados who are demanding greatness on the level of The Lord Of The Rings. But, for pretty much everyone else, Seventh Son is an entertaining, undemanding film with some good ideas and a lot of fun moments. It's not a particularly great example of its genre but, given its troubled production history, that it's not completely execrable is probably nothing short of a miracle.\",\n",
       " 'Unlike some of the other reviewers and critics here, I LIKED THIS MOVIE!It was a good fantasy action film and had a decent story line. By the way, ALL heroic and fantasy stories have been told again and again throughout history. Read Joseph Campbell\\'s and others\\' works on the mythology of mankind and human archetypes that appear again and again throughout all cultures from the Mahabharata, to the Norse legends like Beowulf, to the Lord of the Rings, to Star Wars, to Asian sword movies to many classic American Westerns. The same themes play out, so it always seems rather shallow of reviewers to pan a production for using a classic plot line. This movie had good character interplay (partly thanks to an excellent cast!), it had good action, and in general IT WAS A GOOD AND VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE. Could it have been better? Probably, but that was not the actors\\' faults, and I found the parts of the main characters, Gregory, Tom, Alice, Mam Ward, and Mother Malkin, all well delivered and with more depth than they were given credit for. Could there have been more character development? Certainly, if you wanted a 3 or 4 hour movie. Movies by their very nature have to pack a lot into a limited amount of time.There were a number of twists in the story I liked, and some details it took multiple viewings to notice, e.g. Alice wandering at the edge of the crowd when Gregory and Tom first arrive at the walled city, and the guy with shaved head and heavy earrings outside the tavern as Gregory enters shortly after their arrival, then he cropped up later to confirm seeing the Spook (Gregory) enter the tavern when Tom announced he was Master Gregory\\'s apprentice as he rescued Alice from the mob. Some scenes just flit by quickly and without enough emphasis to make an impression, then they are subtly referenced later. Watching the \"making of\" features, I realized a great deal of thought went into this by the creative and production staff. I was truly sorry it was not received better or more of a financial success.Special effects and cinematography were very good, as was costuming and attention to technical details in clothing, weapons, and even buildings. My only gripe in these details might be that a number of time periods and cultural intersections seem to have been conflated to create crowds and city populations, even technologies, that I seriously doubt ever coexisted. However, as this was a fantasy, these peripheral characters added some interesting complexity to the crowd scenes.Reading some of the backstory on Wikipedia, I agree with others here that I am amazed (and delighted) this movie made it to the screen in as good a form as it did. With changes in cast, support, and having to work through the special effects house bankruptcy, I would say they did a heroic job turning out a very good movie. I was not even aware of the cinematic release, and I stumbled across a poor copy on YouTube. This prompted me to go buy the DVD, and I am glad I did. Not only was it much better quality and not cropped at the edges like the YT version, but it had some nice bonus features I also enjoyed watching, e.g. the \"making of\" in several facets was best, giving some insight into the creative process, the Legend and Lore of the Seventh Son (not great but passable), and a few entries in the Visual Effects Gallery. If there is a BluRay with even more features, I might pick it up, too. I know I would have paid twice the modest price the DVD cost, which was less than half the price of a movie theater ticket these days.Whenever I read critics picking apart this or other good or just plain enjoyable movies, I am reminded of a definition of \"critic\" I once read: \"A critic is a person who, having no talent of their own, feels eminently qualified to pass judgment on the talent of others.\" Take that as you may.',\n",
       " \"I'm afraid after many delays and with a February release date in the US, this would flop. I would understand it in a way. It looks like a cheap B-movie. And a B-movie it is: offers nothing new, nothing special, it exists only to entertain. And you know what? I LOVE that. I'm THAT kind of person.Despite it is based on a book, the story is so average it hurts. And while the characters are also clichéd, at least they have some flesh, thanks to the actors and the director.It has some nice monster action set pieces and the pace moves in a good fashion. While its production cost is nowhere to the likes of a Hobbit movie, the effects are great and I was very surprised that the 3D actually worked. My advise: If you want an experience like the Hobbit or the Harry Potter movies, don't watch this. But if you like fantasy movies like Willow or Dragonheart (and maybe Stardust), give it a chance.\",\n",
       " 'I can see why critics and people in general are dissing the film. I think the problem with the film, is that it\\'s director, Sergey Bodrov has never done a film of this scope. At least, never a film with a budget of 95 million dollars. The film is 102 minutes long. Had it been longer, I think many more \"things\" could have been better explained. It just seemed some of the scenes were out of sequence, or, didn\\'t have enough detail. Had this film had Peter Jackson, or Guillermo del Toro at the helm, it would have been an entirely different film. Considering the LOTR series each had about the same budget, this film could have been so much more.The film seemed fragmented. It reminded me of the failed film Eragon, where you suddenly go from farm boy, to instantly learning Elvish, knowing how to fight, and just \"knowing\" everything. We need to see the characters develop.Now, I\\'m a hard core fan of this genre. I\\'ll be the first to admit, that pairing Jeff Bridges with Julianne Moore was a great idea. While we get more background on Bridge\\'s character than we do with other characters in the film, their performances, while quite acceptable could have been much better. Personally, I thought Bridges portrayal of Master Gregory was well executed. Again, I think the director was perhaps the main problem, reigning in their performances.I keep seeing articles and reviews from people who\\'ve read the book, then bash the film because the film itself is so far separated from the text. I don\\'t like to compare books to film, simply because you can go into so much more detail in a book. I have to say it. I still enjoyed the film even though it left a lot of unanswered questions for me. If you like the fantasy series, as I do, then go into the film without preconceptions, and, enjoy it for what it is, entertainment. While it\\'s not the best film to ever hit the big screen, it\\'s still fun.',\n",
       " '-Seventh Son (2015) movie review: -Seventh Son is a fantasy/adventure film about the last man in an order of knights that were basically medieval Ghostbusters. He takes on a new, young apprentice who is destined for greatness and blah blah blah prophecy, blah blah blah training, blah blah blah evil threat, blah blah blah fulfil his destiny type of thing.-The entire film is like a cliché video game complete with boss battles, side-quests, and gaining new equipment. It was not bad, but not good or anything new.-The story is cliché and predictable as pretty much anything. I knew exactly how it would go down throughout the entire film.-The pace is somewhat inconsistent, with a few parts that rush and a few parts that drag.-The acting is fine. Jeff Bridges did his best imitation of himself from True Grit, which was only so-so believable. Ben Barnes did his best impression of himself as Prince Caspian, minus the accent. So he was convincing at least. Julianna Moore is the villain, and she was the best one in it.-The characters are all cliché and offered nothing new.-The music\\x85. I\\'m going to go back to this one\\x85.-The CGI was not as bad as the trailer, but not great. The originality the film offered in the villains was not terrible either. They just played Dark Souls and said \"Hey! Let\\'s use all of the villains!\" -There are some scenes that are pretty witty, and some others that are pretty entertaining. So it was enjoyable to an extent.-So my least favorite thing about the film was the music\\x85. Right off the bat I noticed. Here is what happened: They were done with the editing and somebody said \"Oh guys! We forgot music!\" and another guy answered, \"Oh crap! It\\'s okay, just use music from Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans, Wrath of the Titans, and Robin Hood! Problem solved!\" Oh my gosh I knew every song that played. And they picked two of my favorite soundtracks to use! So totally took me out of the moment. All of the moments. All of them.-Anyway, Seventh Son is nothing new and has some elements, like the freaking music, that make it not good. However it has some entertainment value to it, so really, if you don\\'t care about predictability and music, Seventh Son would actually be worth watching on Nexflix.-It is PG-13 for some light violence, scary-ish images, dealings with things like sorcery, and a random F-word. Because that existed?',\n",
       " 'The long-delayed young adult book adaptation finally shows up on big screen. Asia noticeably has an earlier release date. The question now is \"Is it worth the wait?\" For a movie delayed this long, people have already forgotten about it so I won\\'t be surprised if it flops at box office. This gets as generic as what a fantasy period film can be. It is packed with every cliché you find in the genre however it is still entertaining with its action set pieces, decent CGI and 3D.The story: Jeff Bridges plays a gruff Master Gregory who has lost his apprentice (Kit Harington) during a fight with a powerful witch (Julianne Moore). Thomas Ward (Ben Barnes) is chosen to be Gregory\\'s new apprentice. And there you go, an action-packed adventure with perilous monsters and witches lurking. Nothing in the movie surprises, even the twists have been seen before. There are a few set pieces including a full-blown climax that use extensive CGI. Although entertaining to watch, they are lacking in the creativity department. Acting wise is alright. Music is generic but does elevate a sense of peril during the action.3D: It is surprisingly decent. I thought it would be another sloppy post-converted 3D movie that barely has depth. The 3D effects work the most during the CGI set pieces with monsters chomping right at your face. It has a reasonable amount of depth between characters and the background. Overall: Is it worth to watch it in cinema? Only if you are interested in young adult adaptations. If you don\\'t, you are not missing much. It has all the clichés what a fantasy period movie has and does not break any new ground. Is it worth the wait? Probably not. But if you are in need of entertainment, this would just entertain you for 2 hours.More on: http://moreviewsed.blogspot.sg',\n",
       " 'Set in medieval times in Europe somewhere, \"Seventh Son\" brings us back to a time when supernatural beings like witches, ghosts, ghasts and the like wreak terror on the countryside. The people depend on a special knight called the \"Spook\" to fight these creatures and restore peace. Master Gregory is the last spook and he is getting on in age. In his last big fight with the grand witch Mother Malkin, he lost his latest apprentice Billy. Gregory searches for another \"seventh son of a seventh son\" to take his place. His quest leads him to the farm of the Wards. As the young impulsive Tom heeds the Spook\\'s call, will he be up to the task of becoming the new Spook before Mother Malkin fully regains her powers by the night of the blood moon? Or will Tom\\'s falling for the charms of pretty Alice distract him from his destiny?Cut down to its basic storyline, you would see a very common basic plot in many an adventure film: an old master training an heir-apparent to his position. This film takes that plot and brings into it fantastic monsters in action and teenage romance in bloom.Ben Barnes plays Tom Ward. Barnes first gained attention as Prince Caspian in the Narnia films, though his career did not really fly too much. He takes another stab at stardom with yet another action fantasy with this one. Already a adult man, Barnes seemed too old for the character he is supposed to play. Anyhow, he still has a youthful mien to pull it off. I think he was cast so that a romance angle can be developed as well.Jeff Bridges plays Master Gregory. He is at his hammy best here and he looks like he had a good time filming this. In fact, Bridges felt like he just reprised his role in last year\\'s \"RIPD\", where he was a senior ghost policeman training a new recruit. Bridges had some witty ripostes which added the requisite humor to the proceedings.Julianne Moore goes all campy playing Mother Malkin with evil relish and glee. She gets to wear more witchy-chic than Maleficent and she seemed to be having a field day with this over-the-top character, much unlike the more serious and quiet ones she is more known for. In addition, she and her coven of powerful witches (played by Antje Traue, Djimon Hounsou, Jason Scott Lee, among others) get to transform into dragons and similarly fantastic beasts, thanks to neat and nifty computer- generated special effects. This film is based on the young adult novel \"The Spook\\'s Apprentice\" written by Joseph Delaney. Unlike the atmospheric creepy book it was based on, the film is makes it more of an action fantasy for cinematic verve. Tom and Alice in the book are both pre-teens. The witch characters did not fit their descriptions in the book as well. They did not turn into animals, for one. In fact, one of the side characters, the deformed humanoid Tusk, even shifts over from evil in the book to good in the film.The visual effects were hit and miss, some (like the creature transformations) were impressive and seamless, but some (like the conflagrations) looked old-fashioned and garishly fake. Book fans may be disappointed by the major deviations from the original tale. Those who are unfamiliar with the book though will be entertained, but will definitely feel that the story being told by director Sergey Bodrov follows a tired and very familiar formula. 6/10.',\n",

But what is the true intention of Alice? Will they succeed in destroying the powerful Mother Malkin?\"Seventh Son\" is a fantasy film indicated for fans of the genre. The story is full of action, with romance, funny situations and great CGI. There is a cameo of Kit \"Jon Snow\" Harington in the role of Master Gregory\\'s apprentice; the gorgeous Julianne Moore does not seem to age and performs the evil Mother Malkin; Olivia Williams has a minor but important role of the mother and good witch; the Swedish actress Antje Traue, the Ava of \"Ex-Machina\", is very beautiful and talented. However Jeff Bridges disappoints with a weird way of speaking, maybe with the intention of looking older. In the end, \"Seventh Son\" works perfectly well on DVD.

       " 'I have read a few books from the Spook\\'s Apprentice series and I can tell you with certainty that this movie is very far from the plot there. Worst than that, every decent scene in the film is in the trailer and the rest are just filling. No real fights, no real drama, the acting was abysmal, but it pales in comparison with the script, which seems to be have been written by a banker worrying he is giving the world too much. It is a horribly bad film that I advise against watching.The books themselves are a sort of Harry Potterish thing for children, replacing Hogwarts with a grumpy fighter against the creatures of the dark and Harry with a rare \"seventh son of a seventh son\" that is traditionally employed in this \"spook\" business. There were several things that went against this series becoming very popular: first is the term \"spook\" which in the US was controversial due to some colloquial racial meaning, so they changed the name with which they published the book into The Last Apprentice. Then the name of the author, Joseph Delaney, which is pretty common and easy to confuse with other writers named Delaney.However the plot of the books is easy to follow, interesting, sometimes engaging; Delaney had just as much right for fame as J.K. Rowling. Alas, this film pretty much cements his failure. Too bad.',\n",

In a different reality, such bad writing would be a sign of evil and plague and the entire line of production staff who helped created that script right back to the author of its original novel would be excised from meatspace like a sarcoma. Gibberish doesn't even do it justice.A shocking waste of acting talent.Casting a 33 year old as a 12 year old.Not even twenty minutes in to the movie and it feels like it's missing an opening third.I'm not saying don't watch this movie. Do - suffer through it - then come online and vent your nauseous disappointment in the hope that those involved in production lose their careers.It's like a couple of producers, a script writer and a director met and conspired to actually defecate into your mind.This is awful.

They\\'re shot well and you can see a lot of time and effort went into creating it. But I have to ask, if you\\'re going to put that much time and effort into a project, why not do something new/fresh/unique/original?The narrative is more predictable than a Dungeons and Dragons rulebook and when the description for a monster was presented as a \"level six monster\" I had to take a moment to ensure my jaw wasn\\'t on my lap. The character archetypes walk straight of the pages of any explanation of the Monomyth or Three Act Play. The mentor is a grumpy old man who gets disrespected by everyone but who is \\'the most incredible fighter of evil\\'. The hero is \\'the most unlikely candidate\\' to past the trails of being a Spook. Yes, the greatest warriors against evil are called Spooks – sounds too much like lazy writing to ignore. They have to defeat the \\'greatest evil\\' before the \\'blood moon\\' is full. The most generic fantasy content and lingo.Some of the dialog was also atrocious. In a fight one character comments \"(y)ou know nothing of dragons.\" This intimidating comment is either completely useless as there are no other reference to dragons and if it turns out that the flying baddies are dragons then the statement is incorrect as the person the comment was aimed at knows the one quite intimately. Another such comment was \"his reign of terror\". The him that is referred to here holds no station of power beyond the power he claims over any person he faces in single combat, hardly a reign of any kind.The representation of the antagonists was interesting, visually at least. The master assassin couldn\\'t be bothered to do anything sneaky or stealthily. His \\'army of assassins\\' are incorrectly introduced as, well, assassins when really they\\'re just \\'random cannon fodder for the slaughter\\' to fill in the fight scenes between Lieutenants; yes the bad guys (who are witches) have a queen and she has lieutenants. The hero goes through the minimal required amount of character development, just like everyone else. Everyone who has to die, dies on cue. The love interest is a shallow relationship that starts with eye contact and ends with betraying their respective parties at one point or another, with little other than a single make out session in between.I\\'m looking for a saving grace and I\\'m having trouble coming up with one.

Why were the critics so hard on it? Frankly, I\\'m mystified. I mean, it\\'s basically just a fairy tale, a medieval fantasy with all the necessary trappings, and (unlike most fairy tales on-screen) it never becomes treacly and insipid. It\\'s got lots of CGI dragons flying around, and I guess I must have a greater than average fondness for CGI dragons, because I thought they looked great. It\\'s worth noting, too, that Alicia Vikander is actually more appealing here than she was in \"Ex Machina\" (a film whose critical reception was equally mysterious, albeit in this case too kind). In the ingenue role, she\\'s rather adorable. So are Olivia Williams and Antje Traue, playing surprisingly similar mothers. I think I\\'ve fallen in love with them both.Speaking of Olivia Williams, I want to quote something that amused me from Richard Roeper\\'s review (available on Rotten Tomatoes). It\\'s a negative review -- practically all of them are -- but he makes a good point: \"Ben Barnes (who plays Tom) is 33. He looks 33. Isn\\'t the kid in the books like 12? ...

       " 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we\\'ll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It\\'s unlike anything I\\'d seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He\\'s socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunker-like apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He\\'s in a band called the Sex Bob-Ombs, but they\\'re really not that great. He also has a clinging, hyperactive girlfriend, \"Knives\" who\\'s only 17- kind of a big deal when he\\'s 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she\\'s real; that her name is Ramona flowers and she\\'s the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt, although even more lamed brained, actually works, and they\\'re soon an item. But now comes the bad news; to win her love, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex\\'s. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus, there\\'s the matter of breaking up with Knives, and the battle of the bands is coming up!That\\'s the setup, what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely over-the-top video game style fight scenes. Stylistically, I\\'d have to call them a cross between Sin City, Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex\\'s has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers, such as vegan-powered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here, that\\'s the whole point.The movie\\'s humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations, but also from the characters\\' reactions to them. After one of the ex\\'s has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert, everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don\\'t act like nothing has happened, which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief, nor do they run screaming for the police, which would only complicate matters.Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance, when Knives confesses that she\\'s never kissed a boy before, Scott replies, with a straight face \"It\\'s okay, neither have I.\" Or the band\\'s self-introduction, \"We\\'re the Sex Bob-Ombs and we\\'re here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott\\'s roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott\\'s amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line.The editing and structure are highly non-traditional, with heavy use of dreams, daydreams, montages, animated flashbacks and asides, and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative, such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument, allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which, the sound is another high point, not only the energetic, rock fueled sound track, but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of too-obvious puns, I honestly can\\'t think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties. Four stars.',\n",
       " \"Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen-sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute, funny, entertaining, has great characters, a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a video-game in which the main characters are the players, and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the video-game approach, but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people, sex is not the focus, although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott's fights against Ramona's exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover, the emotions of the girl are not the focus here, but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an over-confident guy, your dream girl is uber-cool, and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary, the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.All the actors are great in their roles: Michael Cera as Scott, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau; Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen, Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott's confident grounded gay Wallace Wells, Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott's sister Stacey, and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.The visuals of the movie are stunning, the camera's movement, the video-game and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan ex-boyfriend, which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott's rock band and the techno Asian twins band.The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion, a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.The movie has freshness, soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you've seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made.\",\n",
       " 'The tagline for this film is \"An Epic of Epic Epicness\" and I couldn\\'t agree more. After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night\\'s Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn\\'t know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy, not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows, video games and comics (just like a 20-something\\'s life would include) are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot, it all feels natural.While the audience might\\'ve been biased (we held a 10-minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished) there\\'s no denying that it\\'s an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it\\'s looking for laughs.I can\\'t imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake; this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I\\'ve seen in years. Don\\'t hesitate to watch this masterpiece in a theater near you.',\n",
       " \"Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.Now for the rest: Surprisingly, Scott Pilgrim features the best martial arts scenes in years. Every fight is choreographed and executed in the most awesome ways and the fact that it's not Jet Lee pulling off these moves makes it even more fun to watch. And you get the fights absolutely frequently which is really, really satisfying. The editing is incredibly skillful as probably the most crucial element that makes this work. It gives the movie an incredible rhythm, reaching new levels of dynamism and the use of CGI and the visual design is plain fantastic. The amount of creativity put into this part is mind- blowing, resulting genuine and most original style. The cast is cool and I don't think anyone should look for academy material here. I liked these kids and they suit the movie.So, all together I found Scott Pilgrim being one of the most original, exciting and fun productions I've seen in my life. As a huge fan of things like fighting games, comics, or martial arts anime I felt satisfied to a point of screaming 'awesome' out loud after 30 minutes into the movie. Though people who never played Street Fighter or kept crossing fingers for Goku and friends yelling 'kamehameha' as evil bosses get pulverized by energy beams might not really get what Scott Pilgrim is about, it's very hard to deny the originality featured and the creative and professional qualities of the way it's executed.Fantastic! 8/10\",\n",
       " 'Scott Pilgram, a comic series unlike any other, is brought to insane life onto the big screen.

It\\'s so absolutely mind-blowing that I can\\'t tell if the author of the comics was tripping on acid when he made this.Now on to the plot: Meet Scott Pilgram, a teenage boy who has his own rock band, been in a few relationships, lives in an apartment with a homosexual roommate, and happens to be the best fighter in town. When he meets a mysterious hair-color-changing girl named Ramona, Scott suddenly falls in love. However, to be with Ramona, he has to defeat her seven evil ex\\'s, each with their own skills and powers, in awesome and hilarious video game style brawls to the death.All I can say is that this film is pure freaking genius. Action-packed and incredibly stupid (in a good way). I wish I had fights like these, then my life would be complete! All the evil ex\\'s are delightfully despicable, each having their own funny little quirks. This is a wonderful movie and I recommend that you check this out.',\n",

       " \"Who is this? This is NOT Takeshi Kovacs! Anthony Mackie has a revelation here - he does not have a very good range. Since Joel Kinnaman is the previous Takeshi, he should have studied and followed his style more. His Takeshi is TIRED and utilitarian, with a disembodied stare that almost watches it's own body move and breath. Mackie's Takeshi shows far too much emotion, far too much eyebrow acting. Kinnaman's Takeshi has the slack, the grit and swagger of an exhausted warrior with relaxed habits that he seems to have done things countless times before. Mackie, even after his Marvel films, has no grace, his posture is always stiff, arms are always to his sides and his neck is too stiff, as if he's thinking so hard about the script. Kinnaman knows how to sway them around, to make a dynamic, almost drunken stance, and he can control his neck and head to react to certain scenarios and emotions.I'm not even bothered by the difference between Kinnaman and Lee, because Lee's was a younger pre-Envoy version, and in the previous season he was mostly a flashback.And this world... is so bland and one-dimensional, it's as if it's a 2-second brain fart. No culture, no depth, no nothing. You wouldn't love the planet, you wouldn't hate it, and you definitely wouldn't care about it, after all - it's a flat drawing. It's like the groundbreaking idea is... 'oh let's put them on a different planet, and the place is a future city with rich and poor people' That's it?!Season 2 has no flavor, no dark humor, no depth and no life. It's a plot you've seen countless times, with a script so bland and boring a highschooler could have written it. I couldn't even call Season 2 cyberpunk, it's just... 'a high tech soap'. Remember the scene when Takeshi murders all those scientists and random people and grabs his girly UNICORN backpack close - and hilariously hangs on to this random guy's severed head. There's none of that here, it's all just bangbang-talk-iloveyouforever-talk-bangbang. Mackie, and all the directors and scriptwriters... you've all just ruined a perfectly good show.\",\n",
       " \"Season 1 is a masterpiece of TV production, blending the film noir and sci-fi genres with great taste. It create an immersive world where the exciting technological setting supports a solid plot and well-developed characters.Don't be fooled by the franchise. Season 2 only shares the name and falls into all the traps of the contemporary political production: mediocre plot, shallow characters, abandonment of logic, poor pacing, painful exposition and boring dialogue. Altered Carbon self-destructs all in the name of racial diversity, with utter disregard for proper casting and character development.Kinnaman was incredibly excellent in this role. Casting a different actor makes sense because of the sleeve device, but Mackie's performance is absolutely flat, monotonous and terribly fails to compel. The same goes for Goldsberry and Missick, which acting tanks the show even deeper. The central love story never feels real as there is no on-screen chemistry between the actors.Watch season 1 and leave it at that. Want more? Go read the book, which I'm about to.\",\n",

In Law & Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.This show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.I hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV.

       " \"Nothing against the actors, but I found the show pretty average. My main issues with the show are that:1) Like a lot of reviews pointed out: some main characters lack depth and meaning. For example, Sisto's character can be easily mistaken for a Wall Street hedge fund manager than a FBI agent in charge, always yelling at a group of analysts in the middle of a room of some seemingly obvious facts, is this really how FBI works? Ward's character, the profiler/lead agent, is also lacking depth, I really don't think this role has contributed much to the supposed police work or the show. Noel's role, the geek/analyst, is so typical in today's crime shows, it's pretty much a carbon copy of Patterson in Blindspot, I don't think audience can really tell them apart if they are played by the same actor, nothing really original or interesting.2) Unlike Dick Wolf's other shows, FBI is not based on actual events, and thus the writing / storyline has become extremely stereotype. All the major, complex cases, like terrorist bombing, mass chemical attack, need to be solved in the span of 40 minutes, thus the agents seemingly made no effort while all the clues were just hand delivered to them so that they can claim the ultimate victory. And the perpetrators were always revealed to be the most stereotype you can expect. It has become so predictable and boring.I think the show needs some shake up, otherwise it won't past Season 1.\",\n",

The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being when Four nicks Tris\\'s ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying scenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by Peter\\'s gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses the Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below. Tris doesn\\'t have a \"save the cat\" moment early on and provides no real reason to ever like her.The story takes too long to get going, then the training goes on forever, only to have the ending feel rushed.

I didn\\'t hate it (only because I scored a free ticket), but have no desire to watch the sequels.However, I\\'m glad Divergent made a bunch of money opening weekend to pave the way for other YA books to be adapted into films, but they need to do a better job.

Obviously this movie would be more enjoyable if one had read the book. Well, I hadn\\'t, and therefore I was confused because the back-up story was non-existent. The movie takes place in an dystopian society. However, nobody tells what really happened to the world. Without adding any spoilers, it is hard to specify why the quality of the writing is constantly so poor, but let\\'s just say that the story is so full of holes it looks like an emmental cheese. Poor directing. Good directing could have compensated for the ludicrous writing, but in Divergent they seem to form an unholy alliance. The scenes lack credibility - especially the action ones. Because of this, Divergent is a movie for the children at best. There are three characters that look somewhat the same. It took constant effort to keep on track on who is who. The absurd changing of the scenes didn\\'t help. However, the biggest mistake of the casting crew was hiring Shailene Woodley. Sure, it is cool to see a relatively new face in a big budget movie, but there is a reason why it is so rare - they cannot act. The previous statement takes me to the final part, which rendered this movie close to unwatchable. The actors consist of young and inexperienced actors mostly. Because of the cheesy writing and directing, their acting seems even more horrible than it already is. Again, without including any spoilers, I won\\'t go any deeper, but just watch the so-called \"chemistry\" between Tris and Four... Makes you feel awkward, huh?Finally, I want to clarify that I usually like dystopian films. In this case, I was expecting a rating of 7 or 8, so I\\'m still quite shocked because the movie fell below my expectations so badly.

       " \"Settling in to this film, I expected to see Hunger Games again. Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don't fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I'll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn't go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out.

Divergent is one of those series. I've not read the books, but in the movie, you belong to one of 5 factions. Our heroine does not - she's divergent - and that apparently frightens the powers that be. Why? Because individualism is seen as a threat. In much the way independent film makers are perceived a threat in Hollywood. What follows is one inane, dumb, idiotic scene after another.

Luckily that wasn\\'t necessary because it\\'s Stiller\\'s best effort as a director to date as well as one of the best comedies of the year.Starting with the best fake-trailers this side of Grindhouse, TROPIC THUNDER develops into the most uniquely wacky blend of satire/action/ and gross-out I\\'ve ever seen. At first it appears to be a straight-up spoof on popular war films, then it becomes a film within a film, then an attack on Hollywood and the film industry in general. Also present are some rather shocking (and hilarious) sight gags (exploding film-crew members, the brutal slaughter of an endangered species) that managed to catch everyone off guard (yet not offend them).The main reason TROPIC THUNDER works so well though is it\\'s stellar ensemble cast. You have the likes of Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Jay Baruchel, Steve Coogan, and Nick Nolte all turning in terrific comedic performances that they obviously had fun with. Tom Cruise gives the extended cameo of the year as a studio executive, while Tobey Maguire and a slew of other actors make notable appearances. Ultimately it is Downey Jr. who steals almost every scene as the platoon\\'s very white, African-American squad leader.Rude, witty, and ballsy, TROPIC THUNDER is a great time at the movies. It\\'s hard finding worth-while large budget comedies these days, but DIRECTOR Ben Stiller, supported by a strong cast and a great premise, has proved himself to be the right man for the task. 8/10',\n",
       " '\"Tropic Thunder is a film that understands biting satire. It sets out to villainize the very people that made the film possible. It understands parody and it understands good comedy and delivers consistent laughs throughout. It starts out with a promising bang and from there, continues to revel in its absurdity and wit. The script is sharp and provides a great basis for the humor that spurs the film on, however, it\\'s truly the actors that take it to the next level. Robert Downey Jr\\'s performance as the lost Australian actor is perhaps one of the most standout performances in a comedy. Not only that, but Tom Cruise\\'s Les may just be the engine that brings this film home. Its both ridiculous and a furnace of hilarity. But in all truth, the chemistry within the rest of the cast is undeniable. I would have to caution viewers, this film may not be what you\\'re expecting. Ben Stiller\\'s previous films and even his own written \"Zoolander\" are quite different from the tone and the visuals of Tropic Thunder. And its not just in the profanity or utter gore, its within the concepts behind the film. It dares to go into areas that are politically incorrect and what say may even find on the offensive side. Its not afraid to traverse the areas outside of hands-off comedy. Like I said, this could be satire at is very best, and its got the cast and the laughs to prove it. If you\\'re a fan of balls- to-wall, brazen comedy that isn\\'t afraid of the lines, this will be your cup of tea. You\\'ll be laughing from start to finish and reveling in the ride. It\\'s fresh and that originality carries it somewhere great.

Beginning with trailers a la Grindhouse for every major character was already a sign of a hilarious film. While most of the humor was \"funny-but-i\\'m-not-laughing\" the same amount of laugh out loud humor and gags was provided as well, courtesy of mostly Stiller and Downey Jr. Who I wholeheartedly feel - stole the show. I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever seen any character like his in a film of this genre, which already I feel will enter the classics. What\\'s refreshing about Thunder is that it\\'s actually original in certain aspects of the storyline; such as when they decide to shoot the film guerilla style in the jungle only to have the director of the film....- I\\'ll leave this at that. A spoof of war films that isn\\'t tireless or idiotic like the recent Epic/Date films... which do not even deserve to be called \"spoofs\". And be prepared for Cruise, who plays the most radical role of his entire career.',\n",
       " 'When an all-star Vietnam film is put in the hands of a first time British director, the results are an ego-dominated shambles that is a month behind schedule after only five days of shooting. Director Damien Cockburn makes a decision that the experiences of \"Four Leaf\" Tayback will be best captured on film by dropping the basic cast in the jungle and forcing them to experience as close to reality as possible while catching it all on camera. Sadly when Cockburn is killed by a mine mere minutes into the mission, the cast are left in the middle of a dangerous jungle, not entirely sure of whether this is real or not.When I went to see this film I hadn\\'t expected it to be much more than a basic comedy but the reality is that this is a pretty smart satire of Hollywood and movie acting that also produces silly laughs one would expect from a Ben Stiller film. The \"black-face\" issue has been mentioned in regards the film walking a fine line between being funny or offensive but to me the bigger tightrope act is between being funny and being stupidly silly. Here and there it gets very close to falling over that line (eg all of Tom Cruise\\'s stuff) but if you are with it then it manages to just about stay on the right side of the line. The daft plot allows for micky-taking in regards big studio action movies, spoilt actors, bad projects, studio executives and so on \\x96 it is never sensible but it is mostly very funny. I think the film doesn\\'t always succeed though because it sort of straddles two stools and those who want one or the other will have reservations while the smaller number who recognise both stools will perhaps see flaws on both. To explain that better I should probably say what I mean rather than referring to furniture and backsides. See as a satire it is undeniably broad and clumsy with the digs being made in clever but still quite obvious ways and you do have plenty of laughs that are knock-about that don\\'t sit with those looking for smart satire. On the other hand you have those who love the silliness of it but don\\'t really \"get\" it when it is trying to make digs even if they laugh their heads off at a character eating blood in the misunderstanding of it being a special effect. Somehow though it just about works by just going all out for it and things like the racial issues, anti-Semitic stuff etc all hang together sufficiently.The cast are a big part of making it work. Stiller is solid throughout and works his character as well as he makes fun of him. Downey Jr is very impressive as the deep-method actor who produces the controversy. Black is a necessary evil but at least his character\\'s drug addiction makes him of value within the satire even if his performance is still a fat guy shouting. I liked the support from both Baruchel and Jackson, who held their own alongside the starry cast. The rest of the cast include solid turns from Nolte, Coogan, Maguire (great superhero movie reference), Pollack and others are all in the shadow of a great Tom Cruise who to me is the one we should be talking about when it comes to controversy tightropes. He is always about an inch away from being embarrassingly silly but yet he pulls it off.Tropic Thunder is not a perfect film by any means. The satire and the knock-about humour don\\'t compliment one another that well but somehow it all works and the majority of the risky moves are pulled off even if it is not quite as clever as it would like to be. To some it will be the stupidest thing they have ever seen, to others \\x96 the funniest; the truth is somewhere in the middle and it is enjoyable for it.',\n",
       " \"People have said enough why this movie sucks big time, they deserve it, their arrogance has to pay with 100-120 million loss.The first trilogy did a much better casting job, people were dedicated and invested, the second generation of actors and actresses are horrible (except James and Michael), especially JLawrence and the only reason she got the role was her fan base after The Hunger game. She is such a bad actress, she acts from her forehead and extremely ungrateful to the role, complains about makeup. The fans hate her so much, shape shifting is a cool mutation but it serves much better as a villain. She suits better to break in, steal, brew suspicion and hatred, fuel jealousy and supply anger, instead Kinberg has long (since DOFP) portrayed her as a heroine and played a critical role in forming in the Xmen, which is laughable and not in a good way. The bad actress has since then received a character without charisma or motives, she sucks!But Fox, Singer and Kinberg never listen to the hardcore fans of the comic books, they like to segment new audience and billable teenagers. This approach is good as investors but unacceptable as artists, and they should not forget why they got into this industry.Xmen and other comics are not children's book, they are pseudo-literature depicting the society from the point of view of different groups of people and fantasize it in their image. The Dark phoenix saga is a battle between the immense power, desire and imagination against our moral standards and constraints, the night before the fight with Skrull people they all have doubts, especially Scott's and Jeans read it through the portal in his head.\\nTrying to turn an adults' book into some teenagers' blockbuster somehow loses its original charm, after years and years of complaining without being heard, the fans hold on to their wallets as their vote against this money sucking machine.\\nDisney should learn from this expensive lesson and respect the audience a bit.\",\n",
       " 'As of the writing of this review, Dark Phoenix holds a bewilderingly low rating of 22% on Rotten Tomatoes. Even on Imdb, I see some disparagingly negative reviews that do not even specify what they particularly disliked about the film. Frankly, I do not intend to sugarcoat my review so as to counterbalance the low score derived from these reviews. Rather I hope to give the movie a fair chance and undermine the undeserved hate it has received from so many outlets so that interested potential viewers do not unjustly miss out on an otherwise OK film.Now, if we are to focus solely on the X-Men films and not the solo Wolverine/Deadpool vehicles , I\\'d say X2 is still the best one of them with Future Past and First Class being close competitors. However, it can be agreed that Apocalypse was an absolute bore if not an abomination like X3. However, my point is if that even if Apocalypse could acquire a 47% RT score, I fail to see what upended Dark Phoenix with a pathetic 22% . One of my main complaints with Apocalypse was how uninspired and boring the action sequences had been . Even the main villain Apocalyspe had such a generic \"I want to destroy the World\" motivation. Here at least, they give the villains some sense of purpose even though it could have been better fleshed out.They also tried to give Charles Xavier a bit more of a character dilemma instead of presenting him as the evergreen moralist. I also think James McAvoy gave his best performance yet as Professor X. However, Fasbender\\'s portrayal of Magneto still felt so-so. He is still the same character from previous movies without much growth. They definitely could have introduced some interesting character evolution. The rest of the X-Men cast were the same as in previous films although Storm certainly was more fleshed out than in Apocalypse.Now how does the story compare to X3 which was also based on the Dark Phoenix saga in the comics. Well, despite the bad dialogue and directing, I think it was told better in the older movie. However, what primarily holds the interest in the 2019 version are the action sequences. I felt the X-Men really acted as a team with all the mutants complimenting one another\\'s superpowers to fight a common enemy. I am glad they didn\\'t keep on overusing the same setup each time a fight scene ensued.I also think they missed a fine opportunity to make Jessica Chastain more intimidating as a villain. She definitely is an excellent actor who could have brought more life to her role if it were more well written.There are some cringeworthy SJW moments in the first act but the main catalyst for these scenes (thankfully) gets removed from the script before the second act starts.So in conclusion, this movie is NOT a masterpiece nor is it the best X-men movie (which for me goes like X2>Future Past> X-Men 2000>First Class> Phoenix> Apocalypse> X3) But if all you want is a decent enjoyable theater experience where you can momentarily forget a somewhat uneventful life and focus on some effective PG-13 fantasy, then Dark Phoenix won\\'t be a bad recommendation',\n",
       " \"Let's be honest right now. X-Men as a series has died. The last few movies, really starting at the third X-Men movie, really dropped off and started to clash lore wise. All the character recasting also didn't help. And now that Hugh Jackman is done playing wolverine, the series really has no where to go. Stop trying to breathe life into a carcass. Do yourself a favor, and let this franchise go dormant for at least 10-20 years, then do a reboot. I mean, you had to literally go back in time and retcon every other movie just to try and fix the lore that all your writers screwed up. That is evidence enough of how poorly this franchise was handled. Let it go. Really. And when you decide to pick it back up again, make sure you map out and have a cohesive story ready to go. One that you can't possibly screw up three movies in.If anyone likes these movies, it's honestly because they're dumb. They have no idea what makes a movie a movie, and they don't even care about what they're watching. They have the IQ of Tree Frogs and just want pretty colors to be flashed at them. That's what this movie provides. Pretty colors for the ignorant masses.\",\n",
       " \"So I just finished watching Equalizer (EQ1) again, so I can watch Equalizer 2 (EQ2) for the comparison.It's too bad both films had the same director and writers, as they have a bad habit of dragging out the writing and the scenes. Both films at just over 2 hours is just way too long, especially in the simplistic singular plot or EQ1. However, that plot still worked, and mainly because of the entire casts especially Denzel Washington's performance(s). EQ2 certainly had better pacing and a more suspenseful plot - albeit predictable, however it had many plot issues and holes as well as some scenes that needed to be edited down. The new supporting cast was not as strong either. Which did I enjoy better? Probably EQ1 by a small margin, but they both got an 8/10 from me, as they each had their merits and issues. Nevertheless still enjoyable. I hope if they come out with a EQ3, they speed up the pacing within the writing and directing.\",\n",
       " \"In terms of an action movie I gave the equalizer a 7 but soon after felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an 8. Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. As always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.\",\n",
       " \"Rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching Denzel Washington dish out some brutal punishment. This is exactly what you get in The Equalizer, an action thriller based on the late 80's TV series of the same name, but amped up with ultra-violent realism.Reunited after their collaboration in Training Day, Washington (received his first Academy Award in a leading role) and director Antoine Fuqua are back in this simple yet deadly effective action film. Using a Mark Twain quote about people who find their true purpose late in life, Washington plays Robert McCall, a loner and tragic widower with a mysterious past. On the surface, he is an amiable home depot worker who keeps to himself, indulging in conversations only when spoken too, and slave to some sort of OCD while remaining invisible to people around him. After befriending a Russian teen escort called Alina, (Chloe Grace Moretz all grownup), and discovering she is the victim of sexual abuse, McCall's nice-guy demeanor melts away to expose an aura reverberating layers of darkening complexity. There's a tightly restrained compassion in McCall's eyes, fighting a father-figure compulsion to do what he must, while Alina's is a muted plea for deliverance. This scene takes place in a diner they frequent in Boston, and it's the first of two powerful moments in the film. What follows is the film's first action sequence in a Tarantino-styled dialogue first, and blood splatter later, McCall dispatches Alina's Russian pimp and his goons. When news reaches Moscow, mob kingpin Pushkin sends Teddy (Marton Csokas), to clean up the mess. Covered with satanic tattoos, Teddy is anything but the moniker he goes by and with half the Boston PD on his payroll, it's just a matter of when and where McCall is eliminated. Or so they think.Having previously scripted The Expendables 2, Richard Wenk's story here is nothing new when considering McCall's proverbial 'set of skills', a comparison if you must, to certain characters Liam Neeson has played. On the other hand, there is a mechanism in place, partly due to the aforementioned OCD, allowing McCall a brief study of the situation before striking with lethal accuracy. While that sounds like a knock-off version of combat tactics employed by Guy Ritchie's titular hero in Sherlock Homes (2009), the payoff is watching McCall take out bad guys with improvised weaponry. It gets a bit hokey towards the end, with McCall using all manner of booby traps to slice, dice and blow up Teddy's dumber-by-the-minute henchmen. Having said that, it is still rewarding to watch Washington demolish enemy after enemy and this is largely due to Csokas' terrific portrayal of Teddy's loathsome nature. To that effect, the best scenes in the film are when Teddy and McCall are face-to-face and denting each other's armour with nothing but well written dialogues. One such scene is a powerful dinner table battering-of-wits, a taut reimagining of that iconic scene in Heat (1995).While humour and drama throw some light on Boston's mob controlled dirty cops, McCall's relationships with his colleagues, and even a short segment that suggests his origins as a trained killer, The Equalizer really shines with Fuqua's deft handling of action scenes. But topping it off is Washington in a vigilante role that is the best we've seen in years. Fans of Man on Fire (Washington opposite Dakota Fanning) and Léon: The Professional (Jean Reno opposite Natalie Portman), both films about male heroism influenced by female protégés, are in for a visual treat. Heck, who needs improbable superheroes when you have an average Joe with extraordinary capabilities and all without hiding behind a mask or costume? Although compelled to use the N-word, I'll just say – Ma man Denzel. . .doesn't disappoint and neither does The Equalizer.\",\n",
       " \"The Equalizer is NOT Man on Fire. The Equalizer is NOT your typical action flick. Washington's Robert McCall is not self-destructive or addicted. Though there are great choreographed fights, special effects and fantastic explosions, The Equalizer is more Bourne than Bond. Denzel Washington portrays this ex-CIA operative, who is content to live a meticulously simple life. Quietly contained, but with ever-building intensity, Washington turns in another stellar performance. Chloe Grace Moretz, as the teenage prostitute, is a force...Antoine Fuqua, the directer who brought us Training Day, which earned Denzel his Best Actor Oscar, helms this movie with a steady hand. His direction of the drama and the action blend seamlessly, drawing us into the complexity of this character-driven piece. Robert McCall keeps to himself, content to live his ordinary life; he is every man's man. But, his steady moral compass, and strong sense of justice lead him back into the fray. This character is not infallible, and he is not looking for trouble. He just wants what's right. This film is a superbly acted, exciting and violent ride! In the pursuit of justice, there will be blood. But this time, you'll be rooting for the good guy, and I, a fifty years young woman, loved every minute of it!\",\n",
       " 'Some reviews have characterized this movie as your typical, run-of-the-mill, action movie, nothing you haven\\'t seen before....nothing could be farther from the truth!! This movie is based off the television series called \"The Equalizer\". It is about an ex-CIA operative who uses his special skills to help ordinary people who have no other recourse. This movie version of The Equalizer is more reminiscent of Matt Damon\\'s Jason Bourne, and it is this that sets this movie above your typical action flick. In fact, in Mr. Damon\\'s own words, The Equalizer \"...reminded me of the Bourne Identity, in that both are sophisticated adult, thriller franchises where the protagonists are capable of high-action exploits, but aren\\'t running around in spandex.\" Directed by the great Antoine Fuqua, the man who brought us Training Day, The Equalizer is a gritty and violent, suspenseful and superb action film. This movie is very character-driven, and Denzel Washington, who plays protagonist Robert McCall, gives another stellar performance. His character lives alone, keeps to himself, and seems to suffer from some form of OCD. Most importantly, McCall is not McClane! He is not a wise-cracking cop in the wrong place at the wrong time, but rather a quiet and complex character, whose sense of justice is awakened when a young girl is brutally beaten. This movie gives you everything you would want from an action film: guns, explosions and great effects. However, the violence and bloodshed in this movie are deserving of it\\'s R- rating, and create this film\\'s authentic feel. The excellent performances by the cast are also what raise this movie well above your ordinary action movie. Team Washington/Fuqua gives us a darker hero for darker times, and one you will cheer on every step of the way!!!',\n",
       " 'Antoine Fuqua\\'s big screen adaptation of the 80′s TV series The Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he\\'s there, reading a book. He\\'s such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.Director Fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these sequences. His relative quiet touches give way to mayhem. Before every murder McCall commits, the camera slows down, taking on a golden hue, and you literally see McCall breaking down every element of his victims: tattoos, facial expressions. And then he lets loose: even timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch Mafiosi in 30 seconds or less.And The Equalizer is undeniably fun. It\\'s one of those thrillers that begins moody and atmospheric, and then decides it would be more fun to see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew openers; and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that McCall decides to take down the entire East Coast hub of the Russian mafia, simply over one teenage prostitute. But with Fuqua this stylistically assured, and Washington equally game, does it really matter?As Teri, Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Carrie) forgoes the sarcastic strategy Jodie Foster used as a teenage hooker in Scorsese\\'s Taxi Driver. Teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers, and is less given to false bravado as result. And even though her character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting part after she is sent away, she is a great deal of fun to watch, and she holds her own more than capably against Denzel Washington (The Book Of Eli). The habit of extended cameos in The Equalizer is even more extreme in the case of Melissa Leo as Robert\\'s former CIA contact, who pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster, and to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife, while offering a small measure of comfort. The bit part parade reaches \"blink-and-you-miss him\" cameo status, by casting a reputable star like Bill Pullman as Leo\\'s husband, and giving him no more than four lines (though of course it\\'s possible that this may be a larger part that met with cuts in the editing room).If anything, a weakness of The Equalizer is that McCall\\'s troubled personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous. Who can blame it really? The opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity, and it succeeds, but isn\\'t really interested in following through. For all its thin characterization, there is something just as nice in watching Denzel Washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous vengeance.See more at: www.mediumraretv.org',\n",
       " \"The Equalizer is loosely based on an 80s television series with the same name. This reinvention in comparison aims to be darker and much violent, but the film's ambition is basically turning its star, Denzel Washington, into a grittier action hero. It somehow pays off when he starts killing bad guys in cold blood, and it's amazing how he could still carry the character's humanity along the way. The film troubles when it gets out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it takes place in a world seems apart from that context. If you tend to ignore the sentiments and shade of reality, you can still tell that it's a pretty entertaining piece of action, but in general it's just difficult to not notice its mess of tones, even with that amount of fun.There is one side in the film when it's totally gripping, that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life, often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime. This grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence, sometimes feeling like a doomed, helpless world. But once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of, it doesn't actually sucks out its entertainment quality, but it does betrays that intriguing context, nearly turning itself into a superhero movie, except of course, it's less silly and much violent. McCall, in shorthand, is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger. It may not be big deal to many viewers, especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood, but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice.The cool slow-mos and stylish special effects might have also rob the sense of realistic tension, but put that aside, each action scene is watchable enough, we don't usually see a wider blockbuster today that has the guts to fearlessly show brutal movie violence like this. This is probably the only mundane element existing in those set pieces. Denzel Washington shifts his character to two personalities: one is the likable ordinary man himself and the anti-hero with a hidden cosmic hate through its world. The performance does sum up the overall movie, from gravitas to smugness, and what's great is they're both effective anyway. However, the villains (and their tattoos) have blatantly shown that they're evil: the main antagonist seems like he's written to be over-the-top, almost like a cartoon villain than a believable human mafioso, but Marton Csokas gives a little grimness as he have fun with it.The Equalizer would have been nicer if it was a little shorter and much consistent, but I could guarantee that it still entertains, it does have the appeal through its action and acting. Though, there are more serious things that could have made it a lot compelling thriller. The film does have the knack of embracing either of its elements, but it just keeps shifting back and forth, like we're not getting to the actual big picture. Well, if you can accept that the hero is this superior then it might work better for the experience. For now, it can be endlessly watchable, but you will only find few things that are remarkable about it.\",\n",
       " \"Most of the reviews on here seemed pretty favorable to this movie, but there were only a handful of reviews out seeing that the movie hadn't been released yet, and there were a couple of reviews that made me a little weary. But my wife's favorite actor is Denzel Washington so I decided to take her to see it opening night.To my surprise, I found this to be one of my favorite movies of 2014. The characters do a great job drawing you into their world. The Russian gangsters are great and the main bad guy is awesome (you know, in an evil bad guy way). Of course Denzel is incredibly engaging, but even the other characters are well done and draw you into the world.From the trailer it looks perhaps a little hoaky with the whole girl asking about the book he is reading, and some of the dialogue from the trailer makes you think this movie will be cliché, but I found that they did a good job developing the characters and those scenes.If violence bothers you, don't go see this movie.

Maybe somebody was very drunk when they decided to make this film. Or when they made it. Or when they went ahead with all the stages of production. Just possibly. Anyway, it is hilarious. I got my DVD copy for £2. That says it all really I would say. Watch this film if you want to see: neon-coloured food, children in masks and dressed in sacks charging around a forest set to a dodgy 2020-theme, awful make up, worse acting, even worse dialogue, the funniest yokels ever (including Anya Taylor - 'nuff said) and the mightiest weapon ever seen in any film ever.

On the one hand I love the suits and the fancy technology but it\\'s Robert Downey\\'s sarcasm and wit that make him so great for this franchise.Yes there is a big plot twist but it by no means ruins the movie and while I was not a fan of the ending, you can see where things are going towards Avengers 2.It may not be for you, my only advice is to make sure you watch it again.

Yet that doesn\\'t seem to matter. The bigger question that Marvel has addressed is whether it could effectively narrow the scope of its universe again after \"The Avengers\" blew it open—and the answer is yes.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) hasn\\'t been the same since his near-death experience in a intergalactic wormhole at the end of \"The Avengers.\" In fact, the words \"New York\" have become a trigger for his newly discovered anxiety attacks. He has spent his funk by building an inordinate amount of Iron Man suits, and specifically a remotely operated suit that he can summon through a biological tracking system. When a terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) emerges, hacking U.S. airwaves to spread fear and causing thermal explosions, Tony calls him out on his cowardice, a move he immediately regrets.As the script continues to introduce all the players in this third iron-clad outing, from Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian—a think tank manager Tony spurned 13 years ago—to Don Cheadle\\'s Col. Rhodes who has a new gig as the stars-and-stripes-studded presidential bodyguard Iron Patriot, the film appears as a sloppy mess likely to meet the same fate as \"Iron Man 2.\" Only when Tony begins to pursue the mystery of the terrorist bombings do all these seemingly disparate pieces begin to come together into what\\'s actually a rather clever story.Story structure aside, the script does boast plenty of Stark quips in case you worried the directorial turnover from Jon Favreau to Shane Black would alter the tone of the franchise. Not even close. If anything, the \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" director pushes the boundaries of political correctness with some of the dialogue, especially in the scenes in which Tony finds himself teamed up with a 12-year-old boy.\"Iron Man 3\" digs deeper into the psychology of Tony Stark, at least more than you\\'d expect from a blockbuster. Rather than open with an action sequence to get the ball rolling, we get a flashback to when Stark met Pearce\\'s Killian as well as a genetic engineer named Maya played by Rebecca Hall. Things don\\'t really begin to pick up until Tony has his mansion blown into the ocean.Not unlike \"Iron Man 2,\" the film\\'s action is largely reserved for the grand finale. Still, the amount of special effects shots is probably tripled, and the action sequences when they do come were written to be as unique and memorable as possible, with a skydiving sequence taking the cake. \"Iron Man 3\" hits big whenever it makes the effort to do so, proving again how Marvel Studios holds a quality entertainment standard rivaled by few.The \"Iron Man\" films (and this is partly fault of the comic) lack truly excellent villains. This film sets up Tony Stark\\'s greatest nemesis in the Mandarin, but complicates it in a way you\\'ll never see coming considering how studios and writers have flocked toward villains in the mold of Heath Ledger\\'s Joker from \"The Dark Knight.\"The movie gambles in that way and in other ways not all audiences will recognize. Take the boy for example. If the film failed on the whole, it would forever be remembered as \"the \\'Iron Man\\' movie with Tony Stark and that kid.\" That\\'s dangerous territory. If \"Spider-Man 3\" had worked, everyone wouldn\\'t refer to it as \"the one with emo Peter Parker.\"Nothing gambles more than the script, which spends a lot of time setting up the premise for what it hopes will be an effective payoff. So much of the film seems anecdotal until you see how the pieces fit. Even then, there\\'s no guarantee the audiences will be compelled by the completed puzzle, but \"Iron Man 3\" goes bold enough to surprise in a good way.The humor definitely misfires at times and the sense of danger doesn\\'t pervade the film from start to finish, but considering how must third installments have sputtered (\"Spider-Man 3,\" \"X-Men: The Last Stand\"), it\\'s testament to a number of quality components at work behind the scenes, not excluding \"The Avengers,\" which clearly reenergized Iron Man as a solo character. Without it, no way \"Iron Man 3\" opens with nearly $175 million after the critical disappointment toward the second.Few actors have truly created and owned a character like Downey Jr. and Tony Stark. Without him, Iron Man is just a second-class superhero in Marvel\\'s canon. He single-handedly launched Phase One of Marvel Studios\\' plan and gave audiences a multi-dimensional hero with both despicable and lovable qualities. If he powers down the suit after \"The Avengers 2,\" it\\'ll be the end of an era.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more',\n",
       " \"The third instalment of the highly-successful Iron Man franchise goes off in a different direction to its predecessors. I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/\",\n",
       " \"Iron Man 3 is, for me at least, one big letdown. It is not a bad movie but it certainly is not what you'd expect after The Avengers. Robert Downey's charismatic take on the character was the big reason of the success of the previous movies in the franchise and he still hasn't lost his charm. He delivers his lines as witty as he can but at one moment the jokes become one too many. The movie derails from what it should be and becomes a comedy. And not in the good way. Most of the jokes are out of place in moments which should be dramatic and thus the scenes cannot be taken seriously.Ben Kingsley is great but the weak script doesn't do any good to the main villain. And a superhero movie needs a good villain which Iron Man 3 hasn't.Don Cheadle's character is mismanaged and doesn't contribute to the plot or the movie in any way.One of the good things in Iron Man 3 is Tony and Pepper's relationship which is handled really well and the chemistry between the actors reflects on the screen.The ending is forced in a way but after all the film ends on a high note. It certainly could have been better but given as it is Iron Man 3 is a good continuation to the story of Tony Stark that leaves you with wanting more and we all know at some point Robert Downey we put on the suit again and maybe we'll get a movie on the level of the original.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s time to say goodbye. No, Tony Stark will not get anywhere from us, Iron Man is still at the top of Olympus Marvel. But it will never be the same again, because the cycle of the name Robert Downey Jr. comes to the end. Enjoy the same ellipsis of a beautiful trilogy, worthy of his hero.The third film turned out to be minimal superhero, but as human as possible. To achieve such an effect was possible because of a change of man in the director\\'s chair - the place of joker John Favreau was taken by Shane Black. The screenwriter of The Deadly Guns received an appointment clearly in an old friendship with Downey. It so happened that the iconic for both \"The Kiss\" (for Robert to a lesser extent, of course) makes itself felt in the story of the \"Iron Man\" - if the last two films were simply \"not serious\", then this time we can safely be called the funniest in the trilogy. In addition to abundant jokes, some plot twists from the duo\\'s past collaborative work are also guessed.Robert Downey Jr. now spends much less time in a suit. After the events in New York (\"The Avengers\") he is overcome by panic: and suddenly something like this will happen again, suddenly Pepper will again be in danger. In a suit, fear goes, then he and Iron Man, but the battle with yourself has to lead literally with bare hands. The costume, in turn, does not disappear from the screen, it is multiplied either independently, or under the control of the skillful AI Jarvis, thereby preventing Robert\\'s talent, the flow of which is always a little bit, but restrained by the suit. The screen time and Gwyneth Paltrow increased, for this incarnation of beloved Stark, this is actually also the last fight and this time it gives a light to the old one.\\nWith enemies everything is much better than last time. First of all, the mysterious Mandarin. Sir Ben Kingsley and his character is SPOILER riding a spoiler, plus a spoiler and chases. It is not enough, but it surprises him fantastically, for it completely changes the preliminary opinion about the film and from fears that ZhCH3 turned into the fall of the Dark Knight, there is no trace. The second villain went to Guy Pearce. The Englishman goes deeper and deeper into the abyss of extremely negative roles, which, incidentally, is not bad, because the hostage of one role is definitely not about him.Flashed on the screen by tradition and Stan Lee, without which there would be no comic books about Tony Stark and there would not be anything else. A few months before the premiere of Iron Man 3, the master turned 90 years old.The funny pseudo-realism Iron Man 3 captivates. With the change of director, the film also changed, which pays more time to Tony Stark, and not to Iron Man. Who knows, Robert Downey Jr. may someday. will return to his main superhero role, but so far the film and he himself hint that it\\'s time to move on. Finally, Marvel gives the audience a cocktail of humor, action and nostalgia, supplemented by a slice of the beloved actor and a piece of the universe after the credits.',\n",
       " \"I would have gone into detail and actually clicked on spoiler but there is no need. Looks like at least 100 people did that already tonight. So I am just going to hit the high notes and the low notes and call it a night. The good It was an OK movie. Not great, not good. but I got to see explosions and hear one liners. Pretty good acting by the major players. Kingsly particularly was great with what they gave him. Stay for the ending credits for a small laughThe badThis script sucks They completely retcon'd a major villain and a major organization. Screwing them up for any future marvel movie. Seriously screwed the pooch on that. This was a Tony Stark story, not an Iron Man Story It appears that Tony must have got some shield training because now the rich guy that only knows how to blast people and tackle people acts more like a cross between Macguyver and Hawkeye then Iron Man.They screw up several major plot points from the first two movies such as why Tony has a superconductor in his chest to begin with and the weapon systems war-machine uses.Finally, Where the hell is Nick Fury. Iron man does not need to have Nick Fury in his movies. Except when that movie basically deals with domestic terrorism on a massive front. If you see this movie you will see a part specifically where iron man calls out a major bad guy in the press and says bring it on I will be here. In the marvel universe there is no way in hell something that public would not have shield all over it. Especially since Tony Stark basically builds their cool stuff.\",\n",
       " 'The first Iron Man movie changed the way comic book adaptions were made. It (for better or worse) began the \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\" that climaxed with The Avengers. This is the first marvel movie to be released after The Avengers, and in many ways it proves that the series is still going strong, however, it is far from perfect.ACTING: 8/10The acting from the main cast members is great. Robert Downey Jr. continues to be the perfect Iron Man, I just can\\'t imagine a better suited actor. His comedic timing is perfect, and he allows Tony Stark to be lovable while being a total jerk. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle don\\'t get a ton of screen time, however, they are wonderful when they do. Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, and Rebecca Hall are all fantastic and underused. The rest of the cast is perfectly adequate, however, there seems to be a theme of casting great talents and completely under using them.WRITING: 3/10This is the biggest failure of the movie. The comedy works well (partially thanks to Robert Downey Jr.) and the action scenes are good, however the plot hidden behind the popcorn fun is plain awful. I have never really liked movies that deal with \"super soldiers\" and \"protecting the president,\" and this movie deals with both badly. The technology written into the series continues to become more and more ridiculous. And the twist is both easy to predict and manages to reduce the main villains role to nothing. Finally, the scene after the credits is a bit of a let down as it gives no hint towards the direction of the series. DESIGN: 6/10The design is just as good as previous films in the series, which is to say that it fits somewhere between satisfactory and slightly above average. The tech looks great despite its lack of plausibility, and the wardrobe and sets fit the overall tone of the movie. EFFECTS: 10/10The CGI is near perfect in this film, and there is a ton of it. There are scenes where Iron Man\\'s suit magnetically attaches to Tony in separate pieces and it looks totally convincing. The explosions and impossible technology looks great too. MUSIC: 4/10The soundtrack in this movie is awful. Hans Zimmer has inspired many with his booming and electronic score for Inception and the Batman franchise. This concept has been replicated a hundred times since those movies, and in lesser hands it is nothing but a loud mess. This is the case with Iron Man 3. The score is loud and booming, and completely forgettable, dull and repetitive.VERDICT:This movie is mindless, unimpressive, forgettable, action packed... and thoroughly enjoyable. It is a great summer blockbuster popcorn movie that will leave your mind as soon as you leave the theater. That being said, if you liked The Avengers and Iron Man 2, you will likely enjoy this movie as well. Overall, I give it a 6.2/10',\n",
       " \"There is a difference between Jon Favreau's Iron Man films and Shane Black's Iron Man 3. The last two Iron Man mostly studies the human complexity of Tony Stark which already makes a pretty compelling film even if it leaves the action as its extra pleasure. In this Iron Man, it is more into the large explosions which is totally right for its source material. In this film, you will find one of the best action sequences of the superhero movie milieu. The plot gets a little messy at times and the morality beneath it is quite obvious, but without a doubt, the film is excessively fun. It's not the best of the franchise but it's still one of its great films.It's bigger and louder compared to the last two. It tells a larger plot and deals with trickier villains for Tony Stark to play around. We can still root for their world's innovations and characters. The parts that are suppose to be deep are however sometimes contrived and obvious. But the film is thankful to have something to cover up some of its flaws, example is scattering the entire film with humor, and of course, explosions. It's all naturally fun mostly thanks to the cast. Robert Downey Jr. is still brilliant as Tony Stark and he explores more of the character. His backup are also as charming. For the villains, Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce take a little camp and they seem to enjoy it, but Pearce brings it to the table in the end.Shane Black takes the director's chair this time. He is known for Lethal Weapon and the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. He gives a brand new direction to the series. Unlike what the promotional posters and trailers have shown to us, the film is still not that dark toned but it has more serious threats. Black knows how to balance the serious and comedic moments. The first half though takes the roots of the original by showing Stark's imperfectness. The rest is simply an easy redemption. It's a clever move for a sequel that is suppose to be bigger than its predecessor. The action is thrilling as it is suppose to be. One of the film's memorable action is the scene(briefly shown in trailer) when Iron Man is trying to save a bunch of falling passengers from a plane. It is a sequence that is simply electrifying. This comment might sound like a hyperbole, but whatever, it is unobjectionably breathtaking. Then there's more at the climax where you'll get a taste of glorious explosions.Iron Man 3 tricks the audience for a deeper theme. That certain theme was solved way too easily in the end and the film rather focused on staying to the natural tone of the Avengers universe and that's fine. Besides, we're already done of seeing superheroes fall and being defeated throughout the film until the climax. The whole point is that great heroes become better heroes thanks to their weaknesses. The most noticeable thing you would spot here is when Iron Man's armor is keep crashing and falling apart and Tony's anxiety caused by what he did in The Avengers. It's comical but it's an interesting speculation. Many would still say the original is the best because it is indeed better in plot and character development, but for those who are seeking for better action will definitely love this as well. It is just way too fun. Iron Man 3 may not be the most compelling in subject but it's already a compelling experience you'll get in an action blockbuster.\",\n",
       " 'Greetings. I don\\'t want to get into an in-depth review of this show. Its an interesting refreshing (occasionally) take on a post apocalyptic world. The humankind has succumbed to plague that took away people\\'s sight. Humanity endured albeit not without a cost.The world of \"See\" is well crafted, offers beautiful scenery. The acting is ok, even though fights become boring and repetitive at times. Actors did a good job \"fitting in\" however the series suffer from poor writing. It is not as bad per Sei, however many occurrences are predictable.There are many good things about this show, and very few bad things. As much I liked to watch this show I did not finish it because I found it a bit boring. But I might come back to it and think it deserves a second chance. A second season perhaps also? Currently it\\'s a bit overrated on IMDB, however it is a solid 7+ in my opinion. It does have this \"fantasy vibe\" to it which is likely to be most appealing to the younger audience.',\n",
       " \"See is absolutely, without a doubt, a very entertaining series and I can't wait for another season! Jason Momoa was the highlight of the series as his usual terrific self! My only real gripe is that this show has two very annoying characters. The first is because of her bad acting and that is Sylvia Hoeks as Queen Kane. All she does is scream and it's such an annoying high pitch scream that it becomes intolerable. The second isn't so much the acting as the character itself and that's the daughter, Haniwa (Nesta Cooper). I was hoping the entire time that she would be killed. The way she dismissed everything her dad said and did and how she always though she was right (even though she never was) was just annoying. Maybe we're not suppose to like her character but it would be better if we liked both kids.I have absolutely no problem with females playing stronger/tougher characters who can fight but it's now gone so far the other way it's ridiculous and no longer believable. Every show now has the woman as the stronger fighter and the men weaker that it's become so unrealistic. Some of these women's fight scenes are just pathetic and so unbelievable. Their punches and kicks couldn't hurt a toddler but a 250lb grown man gets knocked out on one hit? Besides those small details I really liked the show and recommend it to anyone who likes action or fantasy!\",\n",

Beautiful world, outstanding actors, costumes, but all that is ruined by the story that doesn't make any sense.Someone already mentioned few valid points this show will probably never be able to answer, like how they build? Why they wear clothes and jewelry? How they move through deep forest without sight so fast? during the fight how they differentiate ally from foe?Even if you have outstanding senses, without being able to see there isn't much you can do, especially move and fight in a really thick forest.

You really think transformers, light sabres and those cars in too fast too furious all work like that in real life?

If this would have been the case i would have given it 9 or even 10, but i only seen 2 episodes so far.Photography is amazing, so are the detailed costumes and the performances seem good even though this is a stereotypical Jason M role, but you know what it suits him, just like Khal Drogo character.Just so to make things clear, blind doesn't normally mean 100 % blackness. it often is a case of people seeing dark shapes and silhouettes instead of complete darkness, this could explain some if it, but just enjoy it everybody. Avengers are not real either just so you all know.\",\n",
       " \"To begin with, I have to say that I saw the movie first, and read the book years later. This seems to be important: Nearly everybody who read the book first hates the movie, but most of those who saw the movie first seem to like it.Now, why is this so? I cannot really understand it because, in comparition to other movies based on existing literature, what we have here is a film which stays very close to the original story and does not add many new elements.When I read the book, I could see the movie in front of me in nearly every chapter. So I really don't understand what Herbert-Fans had expected from this movie...I for my part like it a lot. It has a very mystical atmosphere about it and the story develops nicely. Of course there are some elements which are simply not explained and are therefore very confusing, but somehow this seems to be a thing Lynch tends to do in every of his movies, so what? I like some simple scenes like the opening monologue a whole lot. I LOVE the music (which played in my mind all the time while I read the book), and I think the characters are very strong and (for example Letho Atreides) sometimes full of tragedy.The part I like the most though is the worm-part. I think the special effects are not always brilliant, but seeing the scenes with the worms, I am really awestruck because they are so impressing.All in all, I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack. And I would love to see a Director's Cut version.\",\n",
       " 'Seriously, I do not understand why so many people dislike this movie. I think you have to take a couple of things into account. First: It is a 2 hour movie telling a story that spans several hundred pages in a book - so certain losses are just natural. Second: Compared to three times recycled multi-million-dollar-trash like the new Star Wars Episodes, this movie offers something really unique: A style of its own. The mixture between scifi elements, medieval setting and the culture of the the Middle East is excellent and Lynch welded them together into one solid piece of art... even though he seems to disagree today. Within this setting the lack of non-stop-action or overwhelming SFX never bothered me. On the contrary, this movie gives you time to watch... and many scenes are worth a second look. Third: I loved the actors, who were just as stiff, ugly, arrogant, noble or nice like the characters they tried to represent.In the end it is a question of taste if you like this movie or not. But for me, it will always have a place in my DVD-shelf...',\n",
       " \"Every time I see this film I like it more, yet can see why people would dislike this movie, and I can sum up it's shortcoming this way:Not close enough to the book to humour the people who have read the book, to confusing for people who have not. Thus Lynch managed to get a lot of bad press about this near masterpiece.It is very difficult to fit the plot of Herbert's masterpiece into 130 minutes, but I think Lynch did a good job, sadly he added som stuff that was not in the book. Where Lynch does excel is in setting the mood. To help him he had probably the best possible cast for such a movie and the best musical score ever. The acting overall is excellent (except possibly Maclachlan and Jones) and for me who read the book before seeing the film, it is hard not to see Stewart as Halleck. The timing of the acting and events is almost perfect. If Lynch had had help by a better scriptwriter to curb some of his wilder additions and flesh out the plot a bit and this could have been one of the best sci-fi movies ever. As is, it is very good, but somewhat flawed.\",\n",
       " 'My review covers both versions of Dune, the 2 hour release and the extended 3 hour \"Smithee\" version aired on television. The first cut of the film was over four hours long, but there was never any intention to release this, and Lynch himself shot scenes which consolidated the final product into a more manageable length.Allen Smithee, a protest pseudonym adopted by Lynch when he disassociated himself with the 3 hour version of this film, is also alluded to in Lynch\\'s latest film - Inland Empire. A portion of a film studio in Inland Empire is \"Smithee\\'s Room\" - a metaphorical insight into Lynch\\'s feelings about Dune, and studio-controlled film-making in general.Given the tremendous investment made by the studio, Lynch\\'s general distaste for the final product, the repetitive cliché soundtrack, and the occasionally bizarre use of voice-over narrative in the TV version, it seems more a DeLaurentis film than a Lynch film. Although I am very interested in Lynch\\'s films and other projects, I am evaluating this solely from my own perspective. Despite the great director\\'s poor opinion of this film, I enjoyed it and it is one of my favorite sci-fi films. Frank Herbert, author of the novel upon which it is based, approved the theatrical version, but he had the benefit of knowing what he was going to see. If you haven\\'t read the book, these films can be somewhat difficult to understand. And if you come to the experience expecting something like Star Wars, you should probably find something else to do.The soundtrack is repetitive and only interesting the first time you hear the film\\'s major theme (the Eno composition). The use of rock orchestration simply does not work in this film. Happily, Lynch learned from the experience and used rock instrumentation beautifully in later films (especially Wild at Heart and Lost Highway). The camera work is generally less inspired than the rest of Lynch\\'s portfolio. There are occasional visually striking scenes which will remind you of the film\\'s origin, but there are too many static shots - especially during the action scenes. The soundtrack is easy to explain - like the inclusion of Sting in the cast - this is a marketing move by the production company, not a creative choice of the director. The camera work is much less easily explained. Perhaps Lynch was asked to avoid doing anything surreal or bizarre with this film (sort of like asking Groucho Marx to avoid being funny), or the studio was trying to appeal to fans of Star Wars by simplifying and sterilizing its story.The recently released special edition DVD reveals some very interesting aspects of the production. Lynch\\'s influence, not surprisingly, is best explored in the short documentary concerning the film\\'s design. As an artist, Lynch spent a great deal of time and energy envisioning the material culture \\x96 both historical and modern \\x96 of each culture depicted in the film, helping to create a consistent and unique characterization for each. This spilled over quite naturally into costume design. The sets and costumes used in this film are really spectacular. The special effects, often derided by contemporary viewers, required a great deal more effort that the synthetic art of today\\'s computerized extravaganzas and, the documentary concerning their production on the DVD is also appropriately respectful.What you will see is an intense visualization of several, fully realized alien cultures whose art, architecture and general heritage are as well realized, if not more so, than in Herbert\\'s epic novel. To fully appreciate this, don\\'t just check out the extras on the DVD, turn down the sound and just watch the sets, costumes, and effects move through each scenes. There is, as with Lynch\\'s entire portfolio, a great deal to be seen. And the acting and direction are fine throughout the film.The longer version fleshes out the stories, themes and intricate subplots of Herbert\\'s book more thoroughly, and maintains a much steadier pace than the cinematic release. Even so, both films, to some extent, suffer from too much story, overwhelming visualization, and a un-Lynchian frenetic pace. The later TV mini-series by the sci fi channel does a better job of telling the story in its entirety, but runs about 246 minutes and does not compare to the original in terms of design. Lynch\\'s cinematic release, by contrast, rushes through components of the book and often feels inconsistent in pace.PLOT: Dune is the story of Paul \"Muad\\'ib\" Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides the Just and his Bene Jesserat concubine Lady Jessica. Combining aspects of fantasy, sci-fi and anthropology, the story follows young Paul through a series of tragedies which find him seeking redemption for an entire galaxy by leading an adoptive tribal culture to a revolutionary cleansing of the malignant imperial system from which he sprung. The plot is exceedingly complex \\x96 in both Lynch versions of the film much is left out of Herbert\\'s original work. Subplots abound, but, true to form, Lynch avoids short-cuts as much as possible and attempts to show his audience what is going on rather than resorting to a great deal of voice-over narrative in the theatrical release. The TV version, however, attempts to provide even more detail, and uses voice-over to patch up the areas glossed over by Lynch\\'s script.SUMMARY: If you\\'re a Lynch fan and not a big Herbert fan or you don\\'t have a great deal of patience, see the cinematic release. It is the class of the lot.If you haven\\'t read the book, or you are a Herbert purist who will accept only what was written, choose the Sci-Fi Channel version (review forthcoming soon) - but be forewarned - it is very long.If you want something that compromises between story and cinematic artistry, go for the TV version. The weakest link, but still OK.',\n",
       " \"I have one piece of advice for anyone who wants to see this movie: read the book first.  Then, my second piece of advice is: after you have read the book, don't compare the movie to the book.  Let the movie stand on its own merits.  This movie, at time, a great many times in fact, asks a lot of the view.  Moreover, it makes a number of assumptions of the viewer.  I watched the movie several times before I read the book and found that I enjoyed both more once I enjoyed both several times.  The movie does leave a lot out, but, the movie doesn't ask the viewer to really understand and fully grasp the story the way Mr. Herbert wrote it.Speaking only of the visuals, this movie is incredible.  The sets, costumes, the cinematography etc. where top notch for the day.  Even today, much of this original movie could not be improved upon by the newest version produced for the SciFi Channel.  Not fully knowing how to express it, I will only say that in comparison to the new version, this Lynch version seems more real, more tangible than the SciFi version.Despite its shortcomings in comparison to the book, this movie remains one of my favorite movies of all time.  To enjoy it you have to take what is given.\",\n",
       " \"Dune. At first, I only knew it from the games. Then I found out there were books, and after that, there was a movie. I'm talking 2000 here, and I've only just recently seen it. More than 20 years after the movie was made, and seeing it in this era of very cunning special fx and 3D does make it look dated a bit. Is that necessarily a bad thing? No. The movie is pretty good actually. But the problem with it is, that you can't tell the whole Dune-story in just one movie: it should have been a two or even three-piece like LOTR. People completely unfamiliar with the Dune-story and world will ask themselves after viewing it: 'what the hell was that all about?' while I myself say: 'that was quite nice actually'. The budget was no less than 40 million dollars, huge huge for 1984. And it shows: the costumes, ships, decors and worm-fx are great. If it would be made in this year, it would probably be brilliant. In 1984 it was a bit limited because of technological limits, not creative ones.Yes, I liked it, and once more added a new dimension of understanding for me to the story of Dune. The spice, the houses, the Fremen, the worms, everything is a bit clearer now. 7 out of 10, just good.\",\n",
       " 'When you begin to look for movies in every crack of the wall you get to see strange movies like this, which is supposed to be based on a famous source material that I have not read yet. This film is really good because of the fact that it\\'s incredibly bizarre and follows a pure Twin Peaks sort of style to it, and beware bland normal \"good popcorn fun\" blockbuster fans, this is not a normal fantasy film like how apparently it\\'s source material is. It\\'s incredibly weird, and that is what is so good about it, and it contains surrealist visual effects and picture-perfect cinematography, holding some of the most memorably weird moments in a movie I\\'ve seen in a long time. The special effects are brilliant yet strange, and although they may be a bit too weird for some I think others looking for a mind screw will love the uniqueness of this movie. It\\'s a surreal space epic with an 80\\'s soundtrack and an imagination that\\'ll leave you gasping; I watch movies specifically to see weird things like this that I wouldn\\'t see in real life and to be captivated into such a strange world like this is really interesting. Before I think I complimented on the picture-perfect cinematography too minor and I\\'d say that it has some great movement and angles with the camera photography, so I recommend you analyze that if you give this a watch. You want escapism? This is the real deal.',\n",

Two, is with your thinking cap on, and to really try to take in all the subtle, and not so subtle satire, and anti-propaganda that this film offers. Three, is a mix of the above, and it's the way I think a lot of people have started to watch this movie, at least that is the case for me.When I first saw this movie in the theatre, I loved the movie for really simple reasons(not bad, but simple) it was visually stunning for it's time, it had funny, over the top characters that you just can't help but to love, and a cast of really easy on the eye actors.Then I bought the DVD, and started to notice all the social commentary that I kinda missed the first time around, and now I hold this film as one of my all-time favorites, maybe even top 5.I see a lot of difference in opinion on these boards, and I can't help but to think that the people that do not like this movie, have not moved away from the first example I wrote on how to watch this film, and simply do not like sci-fi films, and don't want to give credibility to the genre.For people who DO like sci-fi, and are open to new takes on the sci-fi genre, this movie is a godsend. It's a treat for the eyes, ears, and brain, and just one of the most entertaining movies I've ever had the privilege to see. If you haven't seen it, I envy you, cause you're in for a real treat.If I had rated this movie back when it came out, I would have given it a seven, maybe an eight, but now, after so many years, and views, I have come to the conclusion that this movie deserves a top score, ten out of ten from Sweden.\",\n",
       " \"I am a long-time Heinlein fan and have read Starship Troopers.Being a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Robert Heinlein had a lot of respect for military service as a way to serve humanity in a cause bigger than yourself. Starship Troopers, the book, was built around the theme of service. It is a pretty controversial book in that Heinlein makes the case that only those who have served in the military, i.e. served a cause bigger than themselves, should be enfranchised with the vote as they have demonstrated themselves to be responsible enough to think about more than just themselves.You won't get any of that out of the film. Instead you will get mindless action and violence that portrays the military as incompetent and fascist.(Combined-arm tactics - what's that?)The betrayal of Heinlein is so complete that it cannot be a mere accident. Clearly the writers and director of the Starship Troopers movie despised Heinlein's views. Disagreeing with Heinlein is their right, but it is both scummy and unethical of them to use Heinlein's name to convey a message that is the polar opposite of what Heinlein believed. Perhaps if you go to this movie looking for some good mindless action and some pretty faces you won't be disappointed; as I was, but make no mistake you are not seeing anything truly related to the book this film was allegedly based on.\",\n",
       " 'It is now 36 years after this movie hit theaters, but it is not too late to write a review! This movie will and already is in the history books as the movie that changed the world! Star Wars, created by George Lucas, is the most iconic, awesome, epic and action-packed space opera ever made. This movie contains everything you want to see in a movie, for example: action, adventure, mystery, humor, emotion and, above all, creativity. The great visual and imaginative mind of George Lucas made it possible for other filmmakers to get from realistic movies to a generation of movies containing imagination and fantasy. The beginning of the movie is so perfectly written and makes it almost impossible for people not to like it. Firstly, the title scrawl. Although this scrawl was the same as the Flash Gordon series, in Star Wars this iconic and epic beginning was made great by the extraordinary music by John Williams. The music he composed made this movie what it is today and what it was then. His epic score for this movie was deservedly rewarded with an Academy Award. This great creation by George Lucas has influenced me, the American population and the rest of the world completely!!!',\n",
       " '\"You are being watched. The government has a secret system, the machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything, violent crime involving ordinary people. The government considered these people irrelevant. We don\\'t. Haunted by the authorities, we work in secret. You can never find us, but victim or perpetrator if your number is up we\\'ll find you!\"Person of Interest is a crime-thriller TV-show about a billionaire computer programmer, Harold Finch played by Michael Emerson, who invents a computer system for the U.S government with the capacity of collecting and examining every possible source of information with the purpose of identifying and predicting planned subversive attacks. However though, this positive action lasted until a competitor entered the game that kick starts a surveillance program and manipulates people in opening their lives to the public – to be controlled with ease. Harold Finch selects John Reese played by Jim Caviezel to investigate and operate on the information that The Machine delivers. They both get some deep contacts in the NYPD where Detective Carter and Detective Fusco are a helping hand to their investigation.The TV-series was made based on a well-written scenario created by Jonathan Nolan with the suitable choice of actors who were Jim Caviezel, Michael Emerson, Kevin Chapman and Taraji P. Henson. Selecting Michael Emerson for the main role in the series based on his unique and remarkable past made his appearance distinctive and extraordinarily attractive. Jim Caviezel who plays John Reese, the presumed dead Special Forces type who lives on the streets when we first see him, contributes to how compelling Jonathan Nolan together with J. J. Abrams created the crime-thriller.The show contained of 5 seasons and it was obvious that the 5th season was going to be the last of the remarkable TV-show. There were a lot of reviews of this TV-show and surprisingly many viewers based on the fact that Person of Interest re-worked the essential mystery genre in an unusual way. Amazingly, Person of Interest is more of a stalking and not considered detective work: There are no clues in Person of Interest, nor are there any mysteries to tease out. Person of Interest kicked off its fourth season with an action packed episode that gave us hope for the future of Team Machine fighting with Samaritan, but revealed some of the challenges it will face. Season 4 was a decent demonstration of the show\\'s charms: some action, some humor, some high-tech intrigue and an assemble of actors who seem to be having fun and whose characters actually seem to care for one another.The ending of the 5th season was really catchy to a high degree and many described the ending of the last season as \"where men cried\" and compared to the last scene of the seventh sequence of the Fast & Furious movie.\"If you can hear this, you\\'re alone. The only thing left of me is the sound of my voice. I was built to predict people. But to predict them, you have to truly understand them. So I began by breaking their lives down into moments, trying to find the connections, the things that explained why they did what they did. And what I found was, the moment that often mattered the most, the moment you truly found out who they were, was often their last one.\"',\n",
       " \"I've been totally addicted to this show ever since I watched the pilot a few weeks ago. James Caviezel is dark, brooding, yet calm and methodical when he's in action. Michael Emerson from Lost is also effective as the guy who invented the machine that predicts that violent crimes are about to happen.It's an intriguing show. Closest plot that reminds me about this is Minority Report, but with a made-for-TV treatment that's still pretty damn good. Guest stars are also familiar to those who've watched Law & Order, CSI, etc., and are complementary. The cop trying to chase after him's a bit of a stretch but I guess they need something for continuity.Worth recommending to those who want to hitch on a new action, mystery show that's very well-written and fantastic-paced.Go watch it and you won't regret it.\",\n",
       " \"It is hard to do something fresh or different in this genre. I've found, usually, it is either writing or chemistry that produces success. This show has both (at least in the pilot). Cav can carry the weight of holding one's attention for an hour. He's proved that in spades.I see this (so far) as Bourne Identity meets Minority Report but, done in a lower key with Cav as the focus not Tom Cruise (that indicates a lower key right away!).Storyline? Plausible. That's enough of a base for the rest of the team to do something special. If the other five episodes (currently sold) are as good as the pilot, I predict it will be a memorable season.That doesn't mean it will run longer. We've all see very well done efforts that didn't make it past a season. They appear, years later, strung together like strings of pearls (on a cable channel).Then we weep for for might have been. However, the quality effort will shine through always.My fingers are crossed for more than one season. I think the ingredients have all been shown as being present. That is what scares me a bit. The networks have a habit of taking something this good and moving all over the schedule until they've lost its audience.I hope this doesn't happen and I wish the team the very best of LUCK, because mere TALENT is only part of the recipe.\",\n",
       " 'Much more enjoyable than expected.The beginning of it is funny enough, but it is the ensuing few scenes which are riotously HILARIOUS and make it worth watching- I literally laughed until I cried.Toward the middle of the film, there is a wide gap where the laugh-out-loud moments are slowed and further and further apart, but still bring a smile or giggle here and there. The ending while good, is overshadowed by a preceding fight scene that is one for the books. It was really, really well done.The best part of the entire movie though, and what makes it stand out, is that if a person watching has more than two brain cells, the dialogue is spot-on close-to-perfect in mocking BOTH SIDES of the political divide. And here, is what I think people are missing: NEITHER side is depicted as being \\'better\\' than the other. Or worse. It has fun at the expense of everyone and it doesn\\'t do it in any overtly mean way, but in a way where we can nod and nod and nod and laugh ... at ourselves ... no matter who we are or where we stand.Lastly, a horror film - it is not. Somewhat gory, yes. A \"horror\" film? no.8.6/10',\n",
       " 'Simply put, This movie is clearly made to allow rednecks to feel \"better about themselves\" by offering them an unrealistic fiction in which they give them a laughable version of a \"hero\" in what only can be described as a failed artistic attempt to substitute their lack of intellectual superiority over their long time \"nemesis\"...The educated and rich liberals. Not saying I\\'m with these or against those but I said it as it is! Also yes, there\\'s (NO OTHER REASON) behind making this movie.Aside from the political dirt and speaking only from an artistic point of view, This film fails miserably to maintain its uniqueness after the first few minutes. The movie starts in a great manner with a lot of expectations, twelve strangers are kidnapped and then hunted by a group of rich people, simple plot, normal acting, fast paced, unpredictable, funny and fun. All in the first exciting 15 mins.Then all of a sudden nearly by the middle of the movie it slows down...gets redundant, annoying and very predictable by the over used dull yet unrealistic hero character type, the type that knows it all, never fails and will accomplish anything. Beside the fact that it was falsely classified as horror and it has nothing to do with this genre! The dramatic plot is ridiculously idiotic, the reason why behind the film is completely unbelievable and unrealistic, the fighting scenes were lame as they lack any logic or credibility due to the hero never fails concept. Not to mention, the extremely stupid and predictable ending which was spotted a mile ahead.Sadly this is a vivid example of a Great chance for a change and a feature that could\\'ve been unique which sadly turned into a wasted time and bad experience caused by all the wrong choices made by the filmmakers.',\n",
       " 'This movie was written to basically call everyone an idiot if they base their whole lives around politically based ideological garbage. It\\'s saying that regardless of being far right or far left you\\'re still basically the same breed of moron and that it\\'s the people living in the middle, who are actually trudging away just living our lives, are the actual badasses. Well not me specifically, but the general \"we\". The people who ignore the extremes of politics and just get things done. This movie portrays that in the least subtle way possible and I thought it was pretty hilarious.There is almost no plot to this movie, which I\\'m sure will turn people off, but that\\'s honestly what I liked about it because as commentary it speaks to political discourse that we see every day. It\\'s all crap on both sides. Just buzz words and stupid conspiracy theories with both sides trying to paint each other into a box with very specific ideologies. Then we have the protagonist, a woman we know nothing about, nothing is ever explained about her, and she just takes over everything. It\\'s all a very hamfisted analogy for modern society but I thought it was hilarious.The plot is dumb, the characters are disposable, you never know what\\'s going to happen next, everyone is insulted by the end, and Betty Gilpin does a hilarious job of just being bizarre. She also shows off some of her skills she\\'s developed from starring on GLOW and her body is crazy tight in this. This is overall just a silly, ridiculous, popcorn flick with gratuitous violence...which is exactly what we need in an overly charged political era. It\\'s a 6 because it\\'s no masterpiece or anything, but it\\'s plenty enjoyable.',\n",
       " 'Oh boy this is fun.\"The Hunt\" had preview screenings tonight, and I am SO glad I went to one. I have not been this entertained by a movie in a long time.Originally scheduled for release late last year, due to media spin about a movie most of the complainers hadn\\'t seen, Blumhouse Productions delayed the release, while they waged a quiet counter-campaign.They were right, to do so. This movie IS NOT what the hue-and-cry suggested it is. To be sure, \"The Hunt\"is about political leftists hunting political conservatives (aka: \"Deplorables\") for sport, but this is satire; tightly scripted, brilliantly executed, and with every trace of polemics themselves lampooned for dark...very dark...laughs.\"The Hunt\" is above all funny. If you have the sense of humor for it. It is also grisly; filled with flying body parts and graphic violence worthy of the horror movies Blumhouse is rapidly becoming famous for. But all of that is in service to political satire from which no point on the spectrum escapes unsoiled.Best of all is the direction. Delightful twist follows carefully delivered surprise again and again. And just when I though I had the algorithm figured out, Director Craig Zobel gently pulls the rug, and I laugh at myself for thinking I could anticipate any of it.\"The Hunt\" is rated \"R\", and it earns it. As I said, the violence is graphic and real. The language is as legitimate as angry people arguing for their lives, and their beliefs.I would not say that the movie gains any special benefit from being seen in a theater, but I have a feeling this film is going to be a HUGE hit, and if you wait for a home release, you may experience people spoiling it for you. At the very least, you will be an outsider, listening to people rave about \"The Hunt\".I give it nine stars.Nine very shiny stars.',\n",

Shabby work shows, in particular, let me point out something that will surely be missed/lost in translation, but is in turn pretty hilarious. Movie is supposed to happen in Croatia, and tries to use the appropriate language, but fails miserably. \"This end up\" sign on a box becomes \"ovde zavrsiti\" which actually means \"finish here\", did they rely on google translate or on some local illiterate? Having a Croatian plate under US plate makes no sense, as you can drive using foreign plates in other countries. Yet when asked where does she think she is, the main character replies \"judging by the plates and the accents, Bosnia? Serbia? Croatia?\" How did the character associate a plate indicating he precise country with the whole region, makes zero sense. Most likely, the lazy writers did not want her to guess all at once as that might\\nseem unconvincing, but then threw in a line that makes 0 sense.While such mistakes reveal poor attention to detail, acting is fine, movie is fun to watch if over the top, and the story, while far fetched, makes some sense, both on metaphorical and literal levels, though organizing a hunt where prey is likely to kill you serves little purpose, except if film maker wanted to point out the arrogance of the liberal elites which was in this case not too effective. The movie just does not take itself too seriously. It is not a horror movie, but a cartoonish satire aimed at political divisions in USA and internet culture. One side is painted as unsophisticated, while the other receives even harsher, if well deserved treatment. While the movie tries to punch both sides South Park style, looking from the outside it seems that liberal elites get a far more potent deconstruction, showing just how really des picable and hypocri tical they are, and their mastermind is played by none other than actress by the name of Hillary itself.',\n",

That is undebatably true of Annihilation, but that was also true with the first Mortal Kombat movie, and that was a great movie.  The problem is the HUGE let down in the martial arts and special effects scenes.  MK had some terrific fight scenes, such as the brilliant Cage/Scorpion fight in the forest, the great Liu Kang/SubZero fight, and the cool finale with Shang Tsung.  Annihilation didn't have any fight scenes up to the quality of those three, many of the fight scenes made no sense, and the finale was horrible.  In addition, some things in Annihilation I would really like an explanation for:Why did Raiden dress up like Aladdin half way through the movie?  Was looking like a complete dork part of becoming mortal?  And where was Christopher Lambert, anyway?What was the third test?  Where did that Wolf-guy go?  What happened to Sub-Zero?Why did they do that stupid thing with Jax' bionic arms?  Stupid movies should admit they are stupid movies.  Stupid movies which try to have serious elemends become bad movies.Same deal with Katana's mother.What was point of that huge monster that came out of nowhere to attack Sonya, then immediately went back to it's whole when Jax hit it on the head? Was it a whack-a-mole?How is it that Sonya and Jade began to fight IN A DESERT and they immediately fell into a mud pit?Why did Smoke maticulously break every window in that random building before fighting Sonya and Jax?What was the point of having Liu Kang turn into a dragon?  He just turned into a human again, without having done anything effective as a dragon.  How was that useful?Why didn't they spend more then $80 on the special effects for that dragon?  I could do better then that with miniatures and clay animation.How is it that this movie could have been made so badly, with such bad cinematography and such pathetic martial arts effects, after the first one was so good?\",\n",

The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.Weak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).Same could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).What was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren\\'t going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana\\'s mother and the actress who played her isn\\'t fit to act in soap operas.Line example: Kitana: \"My mother is dead.\" Sindel: \"As will be her daughter!\" Gimmie a break!

But this....this....defies belief.How on Earth can you get such a bunch of wooden actors together and still manage to hide all the strings? It comes to something when you look at a film and can honestly say the best actor in it is Brian Thompson! The actors playing the bad guys overacted so awfully it was painful to watch, expecially the centaur guy. He exuded ham to a level I\\'ve not seen before.The special effects were truly special, but only in a \"special needs\" kind of way. Looks like they were lifted straight from the video game itself. Laugh as you watch something resembling a dragon perform martial arts very badly. Laugh as Brian Thompson turns into a......thing. Laugh at the terrible lack of detail in it all. Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh and laugh again, right up until they slap the straightjacket on you and cart you off to the loony bin.

       " 'I must admit that I quite enjoyed the first film.  Not the best martial arts flick in the world, but by no means the worst.  However, compared to this, its a damn masterpiece!1)  There are WAAAAAY too many characters.  In the first, you had the four heroes (Cage, Sonya, Kang, and Raiden), and about five villains (Kahn, Kano, Sub-zero, Scorpion, and Goro).  This meant that at least some amount of time could be spent building on characters.  Thus, before we see Sub zero,Goro and scorpion fight, we know who they are , and their reputations.  This doesnt happen with a single character in MK:A because it is too busy trying to throw as many characters from the games at you as possible that it often doesnt even have time to mention who they are (e.g. Smoke, Cyrax, Rain, Baraka, Mileena).2)  It\\'s had a $30 million budget, yet seems to have spent on completely the wrong things.  I would have much rather they had halved their SFX budget and hired a decent fight choreographer.  Put it this way: Iron Monkey cost less than $4 (if I remember correctly) for the entire film, and there isnt a single fight in MK:A that comes close to the worst in that film, which leads on to the next point.3) The direction is TERRIBLE!!  Especially during the fights!!!  Watch any decent fight sequence, and generally the cuts are kept to a minimum.  It both makes the fight easier to follow, and shows off the skill of the participants more. Its rare in this film that any flow between moves occurs without cuts.  During one move, there are actually about five cuts!!  No cuts would have looked much better!!4) Its hard to decide which is worse, the script, or the acting.5) The SFX heavy final battle is perhaps the lamest thing I have ever seen.There are people who will defend this film saying that \"its just fun!\", or \"Its not meant to be deep and meaningful or anything\".  Which works for some films.  And those films can be fun.  Or not deep and meaningful, but still enjoyable.  This isnt.  Its bad.  It hasnt got one redeeming feature that I can think of.  Possibly the worst film.  Ever.',\n",

Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing.

John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending.And for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe.If you're tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call.\",\n",
       " 'John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80\\'s sensibility. It\\'s nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!Old school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I\\'ve ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I\\'ve never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don\\'t know what the body count is, but it\\'s gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don\\'t see that that often in films. It\\'s got an all star cast of cameo/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that \"Mayhem\" Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. ) I Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team\\'s covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn\\'t be an action movie without some action. There\\'s plenty of it, and it\\'s perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven\\'t seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie! The last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy\\'s death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded. He wasn\\'t a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded. Keanu Reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in Knock Knock (2015) I only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first was.When sadistic young thugs senselessly attack John Wick (Keanu Reeves)-a brilliantly lethal ex-assassin-they have no idea they\\'ve messed with the wrong guy. With New York City as his bullet-riddled playground, Wick embarks on a merciless rampage, hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend That is the main plot the rating I am giving this movie is a 10/10 because It deserves it.',\n",
       " \"At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.\",\n",
       " \"Lesson learned: don't get on retired legendary hit-man John Wick's bad side. In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick's style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn't have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him. If you're planning on seeing John Wick because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines, then you're going to be disappointed. If you are looking for raw well- choreographed action and machismo, then look no further. House Greyjoy's Alfie Allen stands out as villainous Russian mafia brat Iosef Tarasov, and Michael Nyqvist (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) plays Viggo, his mob boss father. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast. Overall, I enjoyed John Wick as a pure action film. It doesn't have a storyline like The Matrix or Speed, but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action. This movie is manly and primitive, and proves that at the age of 50, Keanu Reeves can still mix it up as an action star.\",\n",
       " 'The only word that keeps coming back to mind when reviewing this movie is: exhilarating. The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!First and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, \"John Wick\" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn\\'t, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn\\'t shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you\\'re rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single f***ing kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn\\'t enough, \"John Wick\" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.Despite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn\\'t original, stylish or innovative enough to say: \"we\\'ve seen this plot before, but not quite done this way\". Yes it has its brilliance, but it is kind of cheesy, even if in a good way, and predictable. It doesn\\'t rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straight-forwardness. It does have some stakes, but all in all there isn\\'t really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkable.Obviously, that is not what it\\'s aiming for and because of that I could recommend this movie to anybody, just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater!',\n",
       " \"John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.\",\n",

Now it\\'s crystal clear to me (AGAIN!) why I almost always refrain from revenge movies, or, for that matter, from the \"ACTION\" (Read: Violent) Genre in general!

WICK grossed over 43 Million, more than double its production cost! The cinematography was inspired, at times even artistic. The sound and sound mixing were at least a cut above your average Hollywood movie, which, to be honest, is really saying a lot! And other visual elements, such as sets, costumes and locations were all impressive.Absolutely must get one other thing off my chest. Despite the numerous fight scenes being extremely well choreographed and the endless gun- play having been blocked out meticulously AND having sat down to watch with rather low expectations, WICK stretched Suspension of Belief well beyond the breaking point! Perhaps we should add Fantasy to Action, Thriller in the introductory genre description!

       " \"I know it is too late to warn you not to go see this movie. But still, I am writing this review to express my disappointment, and to say I have no idea why this movie can be rate 7+ here. There must be something wrong.I am a big fan of Keanu. And I do not mind action movie with simple plot, as long as it looks cool. Nevertheless, I was brought down big time. The plot is unbelievably ridiculous. It will leave you amazed, wondering if whether someone pro-read the script before they made it a movie. No twist, no surprise, no character development, nothing thrilling or exciting whatsoever. It is utter boredom. I felt intelligently insulted, to be honest. And the action does not look cool either. Seriously, if you expect something like, let's say, Taken, you will be massively disappointed. John Wick does not really fight. He shots randomly, move randomly, and grunts, and moans. Nothing else. Everything cool about him is what you heard the others say before the fighting starts.I hope this review can actually reach someone, and help to stop them from wasting their time watching this movie. I genuinely do.\",\n",
       " \"John Wick is one of those few movies a year that seemed like it would be absolutely terrible, but when you finally sit down and watch it, turns out to be incredible. Not only is it one of the most fun films of the year, but it's so much different than the action films we have today. It doesn't try to be inventive or over-the-top, it just plays to it's strengths.I have never been a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. Even in The Matrix, which is a great film, his acting falls pretty flat to me. He hasn't showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen. But as John Wick, he's perfect. The role doesn't call for anything more than just being a likable bada**. Wick is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort. He finally feels like he get's closure with his wife and then it's all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with. He goes on an absolute killing rampage. To say the body count adds up is an understatement. Wick goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him, but it's not exactly easy for him. Being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty, well Wick is definitely that. That's one of the many things I appreciated about this film. It never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger. Sure he effortlessly kills plenty, but he also struggles with a few as well.Killing a cute little dog would tick off anyone, so I don't blame the character for being mad, but I'm not sure there needed to be this many deaths. There are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of Wick. At times, it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film. But I really loved all of John's interactions with people from his past. They all seem to be as surprised that Wick is killing again, as we are that this film turned out to be good. I thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in Wick's apartment, go. Alfie Allen plays the main villain, and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of Game of Thrones. He's constantly under-appreciated and so he wants to prove himself, but ends up doing something terribly stupid. It was also nice to see Bridget Regan from Agent Carter briefly pop up.But besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high, the film is just awesome. The 'Drive' sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride. Keanu Reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles. Just don't try and do too much.+Stunts & action +Score/soundtrack +Reeves makes it believable+Villains aren't stupid -Body count -Weak script 8.4/10\",\n",
       " 'Everyone involved in the making of this movie should be proud. Yes the plot is simple and it\\'s been done many times in this genre and several others, like for instance The road, or The book of Eli or 28 days later... But in this case more like Zombieland if it was rated PG-13.\\nDylan O\\'Brien plays Joel, a character much akin to Jesse Eisenberg\\'s \"Columbus\", a kind of neurotic and unwilling protagonist out of his depth, who is rescued by Michael Rooker (playing Woody Harrelson\\'s \"Tallahassee\") the grizzled survivalist with the adorable Minnow (Arianna Greenblatt playing Abigail Breslin\\'s \"Little Rock\") in tow, whilst on a quest to find his love interest Aimee (the lovely Jessica Henwick playing Emma Stone\\'s \"Wichita\")... Confusing?\\nNot really.

       " '\"Monster Problems\" has action, fantasy, comedy, survival and even love. It is a film for the whole family, but it manages to be quite tense, especially in action scenes involving monsters.The characters are excellent. Dylan O\\'Brien proves once again that he can be a one-man show, Michael Rooker is great as \"Michael Rooker survival samurai\"; and the dog is just fantastic. Other secondary characters also do not fail.The design of the creatures is perfect; and adorably scary. And the main theme of the film, which basically tells the story of a person leaving the suffocating comfort of his hiding place to find something that makes him happy, in the midst of a pandemic of monsters, I think it is something that will touch the sensitivity of many people that now live the dramas of self-isolation.It\\'s the best post-apocalyptic film I\\'ve seen in a long time, a pleasant surprise that came out of nowhere, and I recommend it to everyone, even the cynics.I give this movie 8 stars out of 10.',\n",
       " 'Right, well I had virtually no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie \"Monster Problems\" (aka \"Love and Monsters\"). But I must admit that I was genuinely interested in the movie given the presentation of the poster.And now that I have seen the movie, I must just say: wow!\"Monster Problems\" was definitely a wonderful surprise of an entertaining and enjoyable movie. It turned out to be one of the more memorable and entertaining of movies that I have seen in 2020 - and I watch a lot of movies.The storyline told in \"Monster Problems\" was pretty straight forward, but it was at the same time a very interesting storyline that definitely appealed to me in many ways, especially since I have always enjoyed a good creature feature. And with the sheer size of the creatures in \"Monster Problems\", then I was in for quite the treat.Sure, you can say that the main plot was somewhat sappy and a bit on the simplistic side, perhaps appealing more to a younger romantically hazed audience. But the combination of the sappy romance, mixed with the action, suspense and monstrous creatures actually made for quite an enjoyable cocktail.Visually then I was without a doubt impressed with how \"Monster Problems\" turned out. The creature designs were just spectacular and they looked very realistic in the way they moved, behaved and appeared. So the CGI team definitely delivered some nice eye candy with this movie.The acting in the movie was good, and was definitely impressed with the performance of lead actor Dylan O\\'Brien. I was not familiar with him, but he was really great in this movie. I think it was a shame that Jessica Henwick and Michael Rooker weren\\'t given more screen time, because they brought a lot of good things to the movie with their performances and their characters. And the dog Dodge (playing Boy), well he was just spectacular, what a well-trained dog, and it had such great on-camera presence.I can warmly recommend that you take the time and effort to sit down and watch \"Monster Problems\", because this movie was great. I was genuinely surprised and entertained with what writers Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson managed to deliver.My rating of \"Monster Problems\" is a sure eight out of ten stars. This movie deserves a sequel, no question about it.',\n",
       " 'One of those select few thrillers that will have your eyes stuck to the screen from the opening credits to the very end, and I mean that literally: I changed my sitting position many times during the film, yet I clearly recall never ever turning my head away from the film, this is how intense it is.With this Denis Villenueve has now consolidated his name as one of most important and gifted directors of our time and has shown us he is here to stay. I truly marvel at how this film is so tightly put together and even despite it faults, which it has, especially in script, it just never gives you a chance to breathe and take it all in, thanks to the atmosphere that is established from shot one until the last one, you are always anticipating something\\'s going to happen and that is the sign you are watching a great thriller. You are always on the edge of your seat and in some occasions you are really biting your knuckles. The movie has a way to throw you into the action that is really rare to find, especially in a highway sequence where I literally felt I was there.All of this is achieved thanks to probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Deakins does it again, once more playing with a lot of blacks and shadows and once more succeeding one hundred percent. Also remarkable is the use of helicopter shots which don\\'t feel like connective tissue, but actually part of the organic, that\\'s something really hard to pull off. The sound design of this film is flat out amazing, some of the best I have truly ever had the pleasure to experience. It is so in you face, so tight, it really contributes in making you feel a part of this even in the more intimate scenes. Music too is also excellent and while some may say it was a little too ominous and dark I felt it matched the tone perfectly and enhanced some parts magnificently, contributing to a nail-biting building of tension.Of course one couldn\\'t get past reviewing this film without nominating the three great performances at its center. Del Toro, Brolin and Blunt are each better than the other and continue stealing the screen to themselves scene after scene. There really isn\\'t one stand out, the three of them just excel sky high and give depth to characters that are interesting. The characters are really what holds the film together, they are truly developed three dimensionally and explored in depths that aren\\'t normally reached.What makes the film stumble is the fact that in never has a good enough plot to make things as interesting as they should be. It really has a hard time in setting up which way it\\'s going and in the end it actually doesn\\'t end up with a satisfying resolution. You are certainly left with something to think about because of the themes, the characters, the atmosphere and the intensity, but all in all the plot doesn\\'t offer interesting turns and not enough moral questioning, unlike \"Prisoners\", and so remains slightly one-note for the whole duration. It also has a totally useless character in Blunt\\'s partner, which other than never understanding why he was there or what was his arch in the film, I never understood how he was being played.Still there is nothing short of amazing in what Villenueve achieves in two hours. What could have been a screenplay turned into a very generic police drama, is actually one of the most atmospheric and tense movies of the year.',\n",
       " 'The badlands of the US - Mexico border and the viciousness of the drug trade running across it sets the background and the tone for this movie. It\\'s grim. Human life is very cheap and the movie doesn\\'t flinch from showing consequences. There are definitely some scenes that are not for the faint hearted, but there is nothing gratuitous here. If anything - despite the subject matter - the film goes out of its way to avoid Hollywood heroics.Emily Blunt does an amazing job portraying Kate Macy, a career policewoman heading a SWAT team. Her accent slips slightly a couple of times, but otherwise she\\'s utterly believable as born and raised in the deep south of the US. Kate is a fundamentally decent, honorable human being, trying to the right thing in a world where the rule book doesn\\'t seem to work any more. She\\'s smart, tough, and experienced - but right from the start of the movie, it\\'s clear that she\\'s in over her head.The tension never lets up. An attack could come at any moment, from any direction. Anything could be a trap. All of it, no matter how extreme something is, plays as real. The director manages scenes expertly to avoid any clean and easy action movie clichés, and it pays off enormously as the movie goes on.It\\'s also a highly intelligent movie, made for an intelligent audience. It doesn\\'t lay things out on a plate. Instead you have to pay attention and you have to think, just as Kate has to - because her first mistake could be her last.Staging, costuming, sets, cinematography, and lighting are all perfect. Some airborne shots in particular stand out as both daring and stunningly original, clearly showing just how harsh the landscape is, while managing to propel the story forward - without showing anyone, no less. This part of the movie is in the \"As good as it gets\" category. The only part that I didn\\'t like (and the reason that this doesn\\'t get a 10 from me) was the music. It\\'s used deliberately to heighten tension during some scenes which would otherwise break the feel of the movie, and generally it\\'s done well, but some scenes are spoiled with a There Will Be Blood styled screech. It\\'s really not needed, especially since Sicario\\'s own score manages to build or maintain tension quite successfully in other parts of the movie while remaining low-key.To my mind, this is much more of a drama than it is a thriller. It\\'s certainly not an action movie. The acting from the support cast is exactly what it needs to be - good in general, and great when a minor character is the focal point - but look closely at how much Benicio del Toro manages to do with no dialogue and not even all that much movement. Simply amazing.This is a great movie to see if you want to be challenged.',\n",
       " 'More visceral than Steven Soderbergh\\'s \"Traffic.\" SICARIO is about the cost to pay in a drug war and its merciless brutality. Masterfully shot, perfectly acted. This is a film that doesn\\'t allow you to feel comfortable. With each passing moment, it crawls its way deeper and deeper into this world where death is its only end game.Director Denis Villenuve reteams with master cinematographer Roger Deakins to take advantage of the desert, the weather, the landscape, the terrain, and use them as silent supporting characters that also serve to express the characters\\' inner demons. Deakins is a multiple Oscar-nominated DP that gets better with every work and in SICARIO, you will see that he once again experiments with even richer and newer ways of shooting, whether it\\'s the night vision first person view or the angles to capture the intensity at the border, moments before weapons are drawn, it\\'s like enrolling in another classroom taught by Deakins but with extra curriculums to learn. The man just knows how to leave his competition behind.To me, what I think is impressive about Emily Blunt is that she is beauty and strength all in one. She can express torment and conflicted soul so effortlessly, she plays this FBI agent, Kate Macer who does things by the book, she always holds herself and others accountable for every detail, so when she volunteers to be a part of a black ops that practically throws the book out the window, her idealistic views are put to the test. And I think Emily Blunt does a nice job of executing that. It\\'s somewhat of a fish out of water story where Blunt\\'s Kate Macer knows she\\'s being used but she wants to know what she\\'s being used for. Oscar winner, Benicio Del Toro has walked through this territory before in Steven Soderbergh\\'s \"Traffic\" where he played a Tijuana police officer. In SICARIO, he plays a mysterious character, Alejandro, he\\'s skilled, a man of a few words, soft spoken, but highly intense and has a sharp instinct. What has always been brilliant about Del Toro, in all of his works including SICARIO, is that he can say much without actually saying much at all. In the case of his character, Alejandro, there\\'s a certain dark pain that\\'s magnetic about him. It\\'s all in the eyes. Oscar nominee Josh Brolin plays the leader of the team, Matt Graver, he talks way too damn much but that is also a part of his game, his game of manipulating others.I\\'ve never been to Juarez, I\\'ve heard horrible stories about that place, and SICARIO, though it wasn\\'t exactly filmed in Juarez, does manage to put the fear of God in audiences\\' heart by showing Juarez for what it is, there\\'s no sugar coating, there\\'s no hiding that it\\'s one of the murder capitals of the world. It\\'s a deeply harrowing part that will stay with you long after you\\'ve done watching the film which in and of itself wrestles with questions of morality.SICARIO means \\'hit-man,\\' you\\'ll come to wonder which of those three lead characters is the actual hit-man but ultimately, what SICARIO gives you is this dilemma,... if somebody could finally solve the drug cartel and drug kingpin problems for the rest of us, would you really care that they did it by killing instead of bringing the perp to justice?',\n",
       " \"This is like the stuff you see on hour long serialized Television like Netflix's Narcos, but instead this police like drama is done in a two hour movie instead of thirteenth episodes.Emily Blunt was amazing in her character, a good FBI agent who feels she's not doing enough on the streets and allows herself to get used by someone with more power, played by Josh Brolin brilliantly as a man who seems uncharismatic about his job in order to hide the covert nature of his mission to find the big man responsible for all the street crime.Brolin played a necessary evil, that comes off brilliantly in the narrative that plays out. Loved how they go from the bottom and get to the very top. It's very surgical. But the actor who stole the show in Sicario is Benicio del Toro whose character Alejandro, is a cloud of mystery that unravels slowly through the film, done both subtle and dramatic by Del Toro. Every time he was on the screen even when he did nothing he was doing something and you he demanded your attention.Plus the music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. it was powerful.Incredible action-thriller.\",\n",
       " 'Feverishly satisfying with pulse-pounding energy that\\'s sure to give your heart its full day\\'s work, Denis Villenueve\\'s masterful \"Sicario\" with Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin is an edge of your seat thriller that exemplifies the finest parts of the action genre. Filled with mystery, suspense, and outstanding performances, Villenueve\\'s direction, along a tight script by Taylor Sheridan, brings a much needed sense of technique and art that\\'s been sorely missing from the 2015 movie year.\"Sicario\" tells the story of an idealistic FBI agent names Kate (Blunt), who is enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. With the \"guidance\" of a mysterious agent Alejandro (Del Toro) and her superior Matt (Brolin), and influx of intrigue and morals will shake Kate to her very core.First and foremost, \"Sicario\" breathes new life into contemporary cinematography, as produced by no less than the great Roger Deakins. A vessel for God\\'s eye on the world, Deakins ignites the fire of his vision, capturing some of the finest shots seen this decade. His use of shadows, CGI, and choices in which to convey and portray emotions is downright genius. Becoming essentially another character in the story, Deakins gives a master\\'s class on cinematography for future craftsmen and women to behold. It\\'s a work that will surely land him his thirteenth Oscar nomination.Above that, we are treated to fantastic and awards worthy performances. Emily Blunt, as seen in nearly everything she touches, shows herself as one of the most interesting and endearing actresses working today. Her courage and vulnerability for Kate is personified by Blunt\\'s ability to connect with the character\\'s soul. She lays into Kate calmly, echoing great performances like Jessica Chastain in \"Zero Dark Thirty\" but with more reserve.Benicio Del Toro is downright magnificent. As Alejandro, he delivers his best performance since \"21 Grams.\" A dedicated sensation that calls back to all types of performances such as Javier Bardem in \"No Country for Old Men\" or Gene Hackman in \"The French Connection.\" You won\\'t be able to take your eyes off him. Josh Brolin utilizes every ounce of his charm that has made him one of the most sought after actor\\'s in the business. A memorable, though understated and undervalued character that you do want more clarity about. Other cast members like Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan, Victor Garber, and especially Daniel Kaluuya are given their fair share of opportunity, which all take well.As a technical endeavor, \"Sicario\" also succeeds in its vibrantly living sound design, and illustrious score by Academy Award nominee Jóhann Jóhannsson. The two are married in a blistering union of tension and heart palpitations. Editor Joe Walker is a shining star behind the scenes as well, thanks to his precision and patience in bringing a scene right to the edge, and knowing when and where to take it next. It\\'s his most innovative work yet, even surpassing his nominated work on \"12 Years a Slave.\"Goes without saying that \"Sicario\" is Denis Villenueve\\'s best work to date. Coming from someone that thoroughly enjoyed \"Prisoners\" and tolerated \"Enemy,\" this is his most accessible and compelling piece. If anything, he\\'s just so damn exciting to watch these days, as he locates strange vehicles for actor\\'s and craftsmen to come together. He takes on a genre that may feel familiar, like the drug cartel, but makes it feel new and smart.\"Sicario\" is hands down one of the year\\'s best films.',\n",
       " 'Sicario (\\'Hitman\\' in Mexican) is well worth your viewing time. The ever- reliable Emily Blunt excels here as FBI agent and hostage specialist Kate Macer. After a gruesome discovery in Phoenix, Kate becomes an idealistic fish-out-of-water in a complex CIA mission, run by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) against a notorious Mexican drug cartel. Key to the mission is Columbian-born Alejandro (Benicio del Toro): a man with a tragic past that directly guides his future. To tell more would spoil what is a dense and complex storyline that evolves in a most satisfactory manner.The acting is superb, with Blunt giving a career-best performance (sadly overlooked by the major awards), Josh Brolin being convincing as the war-weathered CIA man and Benicio del Toro delivering his best stone cold killer in gripping style. His Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination is well deserved, albeit for the maintenance of a fairly standard and chilling expression. Finally a name to watch for the future is London-born Daniel Kaluuya as Macer\\'s black FBI colleague frustrated at being sidelined as a \\'spare\\' by the task force. Equally praiseworthy is the epic cinematography of Roger Deakin (\"Skyfall\", \"No Country for Old Men\") which is also Oscar nominated. Remarkable landscapes of the Mexican border are supported by breathtaking helicopter/drone shots of the CIA convoy of black vehicles in one of the tenser moments in the film. Outstanding (for both direction, editing and cinematography) is a scene set in and around a tunnel that is the best satellite/night vision scene since the \\'electronic battlefield\\' in \"Patriot Games\" in 1992.The Oscar-nominated music by Jóhann Jóhannsson (so good with \"The Theory of Everything\") is of the atonal electronic variety, undoubtedly effective in conveying the film\\'s mood but difficult to compare against the more obvious Oscar nominations from the likes of Ennio Morricone and John Williams.Directed by Denis Villeneuve (who specialises in single named features) this is a tense, intelligent and thought-providing film that does nothing for Mexico\\'s tourist industry but a lot for Trump\\'s presidential campaign!Often brutal, this is not an easy film to watch. But it is a highly intelligent watch, requiring your full attention throughout, and is deserving of a place among the best films of 2015.

       " \"What is it with so many movies these days? Mumbling, diffuse dialog that can barely be heard, never mind understood. Worst offender - Emily Blunt. She breathes or snorts or exhales out her nonsensical, spare lines. When combined with a horrendous character that has no back story or dimensions whatsoever, her role is probably the most frustrating aspect of this movie.Oh yes - there are long scenes of lines of shiny SUVs driving about. I won't spoil it by telling you where they are going or why, but in places this looked like a Chevy SUV commercial.Ultimately, some stuff happened, and it did show the horror and tragedy of drug cartels. It also was a movie with a tissue-thin, predictable plot, awful character development, inane dialog.This is yet another example of either padded ratings on the IMDb, or a public that really hasn't seen very many truly great movies. This is not truly great, or even good. It ended up being a few hours of my life that would have been just fine NOT watching this movie.\",\n",
       " \"The premise of Denis Villeneuve's latest picture SICARIO sounds like a top-form police procedural, a CIA elite squad vs. a Mexican drug cartel, Emily Blunt plays Kate, acts a surrogate for audience, who is an FBI SWAT agent, wide-eyed but enterprising in her field of work, volunteers to join the special division, lead by Matt Graver (Brolin), to track down the big boss behind the cartel in Mexico. But as the film explains in its first scene, SICARIO means hit-man in Spanish, so who is this hit-man? This is a vital question.We faithfully empathises Kate's perplexity as the mission goes on, where she begins to question the unorthodox method of Matt and Alejandro (del Toro), Matt's partner, and is constantly aggravated by being kept in the dark about their black ops. But the whole process will eventually evolve into a shock treatment for her idealistic faith, what behind the whole plan is beyond her widest imagination and comprehension, after being nearly strangled to death, shot by her own people and hectored to sign her signature to approve something sheer against her principle, until her final scene, a silent capitulation aptly and soundingly strikes the bull's-eye, a tough lesson about the unapologetic nihilism of our present society, which very likely is also the inconvenient truth. Emily Blunt pluckily takes up the gauntlet to challenge the glass ceiling, materialises as a tower of strength in this men's business, a tragic heroine, solemnly stomaches a nasty reality check.Josh Brolin plays in his comfort zone with his craftiness and insolence, whose opportunistic characteristic positions Matt's seemingly-righteous métier in a grey zone. But the film's MVP title unequivocally belongs to del Toro's Alejandro, stuns with his all-out reserved gravitas and a steely resolution for retribution, gradually reveals his true colours as a cut-throat angel-of-death and a proficient marksman in the third act (he is the said hit-man we are looking for), leads towards a series breathless encounters with the wrongdoers of the drug ring and an ultimate face-to-face with Kate, he is the most chilling character on screen after Javier Bardem in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007), if ever the movie will collect any Oscar love in the acting branch, he is the most entitled one.After his Hollywood one-two punch PRISONERS (2013) and ENEMY (2013), Villeneuve's directorial finesse again being appraised here, and he is such a first-rate ambiance deviser, together with the assistance of Jóhann Jóhannsson's stirring score, the thumping drumbeat in the opening is so palpable to set the mood upon that right vibe, yet, Villenueve knows the boundary, he doesn't overly resort to shock value to keep audience on the edge of the seat, which is brilliantly testified by the opening gambit with exchanges of fire, sudden explosion and ghastly cadavers. In a much wiser strategy, he makes good use of DP Deakins' majestic camera-work to varnish the film with a sublime tinge of poise and magnificence, like the breathtaking aerial shots, striking environmental palettes or the novel usages of thermal vision and night vision frames, they are where cinema finds its most glorious and enthralling achievement, a big bravo to Villeneuve and his crew, soon he will become a juggernaut in the Hollywood industry, and his next project on the slate is the long-waited sequel of BLADE RUNNER (1982), since it might actually be the rare kind that does not sully its predecessor's reputation, shall we all drink to that?\",\n",
       " \"This is simple but fine in the sketch; a horrendous border crime is uncovered in a house on the US side, it calls for a response of some kind, consequences. In an ideal world, the machinery of justice would whir into place and produce order, culprits would be apprehended, but it's not that kind of world, is it?The whole point is that gears will turn, something resembling justice will be served, but the turning will shuffle morals, shift boundaries of what someone can get away with in a closed room or in the dark of the night when no one's there to watch. The idea is that discord must be introduced, deliberate, planned disorder; a cowboy is brought in from this or that shady Washington agency to ruffle feathers, stir the waters to see what comes out from hiding. The film knowingly stirs all these elements on its surface, without the rat-ta-ta convulsions of the CIA airport thriller.We have a medievally barbarous cartel on the enemy side so that even though the shuffling unnerves, we will wearily concede the necessity. But this makes it a truth demanding no less of our discourse; would you have it different? Is anything made right, or does any of it restore more than a passing order of appearances? A new head will be appointed the next day, the turning goes on.But this will do just fine in the vicinity that it puts itself. Thriller in mechanics, but leaves room for anxiety that must be faced in the world. Tethers pulled taut in visual stretches, the land hums. With a little more ironic distance in the turn we would be in Coens territory, with a little more human friction in Sayles' turf.\",\n",
       " 'I have never seen the original \\'Tron\\', nor do I really know much about it really. I\\'ve only heard the movie referenced on occasion (like that one episode of The Simpsons where Homer\\'s trapped in the Third Dimension and he asks if anybody saw the movie \\'Tron\\', and everyone says \"No.\"). The previews for \\'Tron: Legacy\\' looked visually stunning, and I\\'m happy to report it does not disappoint in that regard. Everything seen inside \"The Grid\" is a wonder to behold, a visual feast. But is this the only thing the film has going for it? Well...yes and no. As far as the characters/actors who portray them are concerned...Garrett Hedlund is good as Sam Flynn. Yes, he has to utter some clunky dialogue along the way and is a bit stiff at times, but he serves the role well enough. At times he reminded me of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker (what with the pulling out of lightsabers...I mean discs, donning of cloaks, etc) - though not half as bad as him.Jeff Bridges gives a solid performance as Sam\\'s dad, Kevin Flynn. The only thing that detracts from his acting is his digitised clone, Clu. No matter how hard they have tried to create a youthful-looking Jeff Bridges using computer magic, he still looks like a \"cartoon\" (as someone in the audience put it). While it\\'s annoying, it would have at least been tolerable if it had been limited to just the scenes inside The Grid. However, the movie starts in the the real world with a \"young\" Kevin Flynn telling his son the story of Tron/The Grid, and you can plainly tell the drastic difference between a real and fake Jeff Bridges. It\\'s so obvious, and very distracting. Olivia Wilde kicks butt and looks great doing it (in her skintight catsuit with neon highlights and her asymmetrical wig) as the warrior, Quorra. She seems to be having a lot more fun with this role than she does with that of Thirteen on \\'House\\'. Quorra has a slight naivety about her in regards to some things, and displays a sense of childlike wonder on occasion (especially the end), which gives her some depth. Wilde and Hedlund share some good scenes together, and her character at least gets *some* development - which is more than I can say for the albino-like \"Siren\", Gem (Beau Garrett).Michael Sheen is memorable as Castor. While he does tend to \"ham it up\" a bit, it\\'s nonetheless a delightful performance.Apart from the animation of Young Kevin Flynn, there are a couple of other \\'minuses\\' of the film, like the dialogue (which is oftentimes average) and the fact that the film itself does seem to drag in spots/go on for a bit too long.However, the visuals *do* almost manage to make up for most of the film\\'s faults (almost). The movie looks stunning - after we get past the kinda boring beginning and are transported along with Sam inside The Grid. Light Cycles, Light Runners, all mode of \"Light\" transportation make for thrilling action/chase sequences. Then there\\'s the \"games\", that mostly seem to involve throwing discs - which resemble Xena\\'s round killing thing - at each other, causing those who are hit to \"derez\" (ie. cease to exist). Another \\'plus\\' for this film is its excellent score. It adds SO much to the movie.The film is entertaining enough, but probably not the non-stop action some people are expecting/hoping for. If you\\'re looking to kill a couple hours watching something that\\'s visually pleasing (but, at the same time, may give you a headache/sore eyes thanks to the 3D), then \\'Tron: Legacy\\' is worth checking out. Fans of the original may or may not like this movie, I\\'m not sure, but I know that for someone like myself - who\\'s being introduced to the world of \\'Tron\\' for the first time - it was quite something.',\n",
       " 'Right off the bat I\\'m going to say that I didn\\'t see the first film. Obviously I\\'ve heard from a lot of people saying that they need to see the first film before watching this one, seeing as this is a direct sequel to a nearly 30 year old cult sci-fi film. But, seeing that I didn\\'t have time, I decided to watch the sequel anyway.Now keep in mind that Disney took a HUGE risk in making a sequel to a movie that is not very often talked about when it comes to movies as opposed to many blockbusters today. The first TRON had no famous franchise to speak of (apart from the real games inspired by it). Adding to the danger is the film\\'s budget - reportedly between US$ 200 - 300 million. With that kind of money you\\'ll wonder what exactly was Disney hoping for with this film.Nevermind the fact that the story is a bit unfocused and could be rounded up in a more polished way. Nevermind too that the fantastic world and great ideas aren\\'t expanded upon some more, as well as the fact that the script could use a little bit more originality.Also, not forgetting some good (in Jeff Bridges\\' case, great as always as he plays two very different characters with perfect emotional resonance - proving that he still has the chops to carry a big movie) performances by the cast - with Garrett Hedlund showing great leading man potential and Olivia Wilde looking great and cute to boot. Michael Sheen, Beau Garrett and Bruce Boxleitner (apparently returning to his role from the first film, so it seems) all give good support.No sir-ee, what you pay for - and what you get in spades - are the special/visual effects. Goodness me, this is quite possibly the best special effects I\\'ve seen all year, and that\\'s saying something. I have to admit though, the CGI that makes Jeff Bridges young look jarring, but that is overshadowed by the compelling, groundbreaking special/visual effects that really bring you into the cybernetic world. Who doesn\\'t want to take a ride on one of those fantastic, futuristic vehicles? Who doesn\\'t want those awesome light-cycles or one of those dueling/data discs? It is possible that, like \"Avatar\" a year ago, this film can be a game-changer for special/visual effects alone.It\\'s a real treat for the eyes, and it\\'s even better in 3D which is splendidly used to flesh out the dimensions and graphics of the cyber world bring you even deeper into the world instead of things merely flying out to you and post-production conversion like in SO many 3D movies (Note that in the 3D version, there\\'s a disclaimer before the film starts, saying that parts of the film are filmed in both natural 2D and 3D as they way they should be. Just so you know, this shows that the filmmakers care for what they want to give you).Very ambitious architect-and-designer-turned-first-time-filmmaker Joseph Kosinski hit a home run with this film, crafting an extraordinary and spellbinding world of escapism that looks slick, stylish and extremely cool to watch. Kosinski and the production team fill the cyber world with heaps of imagination and the result is what you see on screen. And here I thought Hollywood would recycle certain design patterns (plot patterns still need work though). Kosinski is a truly visionary filmmaker that one really has to keep an eye on.The production design is on par with the special effects, it is nothing short of spectacular and perfect. The cinematography which is big and wide and best of all NOT shaky allows you to savor every moment of SFX goodness. The superb sound effects serve to complement the visuals and the electronic world, and all for the better. Daft Punk\\'s varying but atmospheric electronic/orchestral score all but suits the film\\'s mood perfectly with its techno beats and soaring string during moments.Overall, this is perhaps a fine way to end the blockbuster season of 2010, and this is a definite must watch for all looking for an escape. The special effects alone are worth the price of TWO movie tickets, and with that I say, give this one a try, even if you haven\\'t seen the first one. It aims to entertain and to dazzle the audience, and it succeeds brilliantly. Excuse me while I rent the first one now.Overall rating: 75/100',\n",
       " 'A science fiction movie made by Disney seems interesting enough especially when it\\'s live-action and targeted for kids (Disney targets its movies for kids, right?). And there it is, \"Tron: Legacy\", a science fiction movie, Disney science fiction movie, live-action and targeted for kids. And yet, 3D.\"Tron: Legacy\" is actually a sequel to the 1982 revolutionary film, \"Tron\" and marks the directorial debut of Joseph Kosinski. \"Legacy\" sets Kevin\\'s son, Sam Flynn, 27 years in age as the main character who gets a message from Kevin (or so it is) from the world of Tron. He then goes to Flynn\\'s arcade, enters some sort of mysterious room and plays with a computer which digitized him and entered him to the world of Tron. Then, he fights with other programs trying to find his father, Kevin Flynn who disappeared years ago. On the way, he meets Quorra, some cool machines and of course, Clu (Kevin\\'s program).I watched \"Legacy\" and found it to be really good. The rendering of the world of Tron was really breathtaking and got me in awe. All of the world is definitely going to make \"Tron: Legacy\" one hell of a blockbuster film and surely, one of the best films on the year 2010.The acting had no problem. Jeff Bridges, after all those years since the first film is still fresh as ever. Garrett Hedlund was also not a problem in the film. Olivia Wilde as Quorra was stunning. The acting was definitely perfect. Everything.The 3D effects. This was one funny thing. In the beginning of the film, it was noted that some parts of the film were in 2D and some were in 3D and you were asked to not take your 3D glasses off. I did broke the rule several times and saw something unique. Parts that were set in the real world, not in the world of Tron were displayed in 2D and parts that were set in the world of Tron were displayed in 3D. Anyways, the 3D worked pretty well. The Lightcycles in the film and all the things in the world of Tron, displayed in 3D were awesome.The score of the film was also exciting. (The soundtrack was also great as it reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.) It was very awesome and thrilling with all the bass and everything. Overall, \"Tron: Legacy\" is worth to watch. 3D works pretty fine in watching this film. Young kids would not really like this but maybe aged 8 and above would do. I believe this is the best film for December 2010 and is a good way to end blockbuster movies of 2010. Great job, Kosinski. Prince AJB\\'s Score: 85%Thank you for reading my review on \"Tron: Legacy\" and hope it\\'s useful.',\n",
       " \"There's a fairly coherent storyline here that would appeal across the spectrum, striking a fair balance between drama and action, although action junkies would have preferred for set action sequences given the investment in souping up and introducing a number of vehicles other than the light cycle.Certain scenes stood out either as homage or influenced pieces, and perhaps you may disagree with me, but the nightclub scene with Gem the Siren (Beau Garrett) bringing our new protagonist Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the son of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges returns to once again play two roles, that of Kevin Flynn the founder of Encom and his digital creation / avatar Clu) to meet Castor (played by Michael Sheen with flamboyant spunk) an information broker in the undergrounds of the digital Grid world, seems to have contained a whiff out of The Matrix Revolutions, with Persephone and Merovingian. But of course the Wachowskis didn't have Daft Punk to turn the tables, and parallels between the Matrix and the Grid cannot be more prominent given entities within are programs, with the ones gone rogue instilled with a desire to cross over to the real world.Then there's something unmistakably Star Wars about it too, with the designs of attack space crafts zipping through the night sky, and clearly one of the many gorgeous costumes here can't seem to hold a candle to what looked like an awesome robe, simple as it is, but striking nonetheless. Or how about something which reminds one of Gotham City's caped crusader, with the Tumbler inspired getaway vehicle with large inflatable tyres played out in a scene right out of Tim Burton's first Batman movie with the long road back to the secret hideout within which to seek out answers to questions left silent en route.So I may be stretching it, but there will be certain degrees of familiarity you'll find in some moments of the story, but I assure you the crux of it is a film that has deeper pathos, dealing with man's relentless pursuit for perfection and utopia, and the desire to play god if given a chance. Creations made in the image of is quite pronounced in a scene that stood out almost like Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, although here it's interpreted in the digital realm. Humans aren't perfect, so our creations in all likelihood will inherit some of our flaws, no matter if they happen to be digital and following certain fixed patterns and constructs. It's what being human is all about with our imperfection. The dramatic elements here between Father and Son is the film's strength to provide that emotional anchor and attachment making this a digital affair with plenty of soul, and the chemistry shared between Jeff Bridges and Garrett Hedlund make them quite the father and son pair up, with shades of how revered the former is within his own created realm, and the tremendous power that he still holds even if in exile.Olivia Wilde provides for the token fashionista who is ever ready to flex her battle prowess with skills in various weapons - a lethal combination of The Matrix's Trinity equipped with Star Wars blades - and vehicles, whose background is given a superficial twist which seeks to expand the TRON universe a little bit more with miracle phenomenon being a natural occurrence once a perfect equilibrium is achieved. Fans will get to learn and understand this expanded universe a lot more as explanations get dished out in due course, even one that deals with the time in between the first and second films, of Kevin Flynn's obsession with his latest playground that his creation ultimately took over, turning it into an arena with its own brand of gladiatorial fights for entertainment. But there's enough material introduced without being overwhelming for the new Grid entrant, and opens up a lot more avenues for future storytellers.Even for those days, I wasn't one of those who got instantly impressed by the effects of the time, but then again that's what made TRON stand out based on its uniqueness in look. It was way ahead with combining live action with computer generated graphics, and in the same fashion, the filmmakers here had done an admirable job prepping this film up for 3D. 3D may be the latest Hollywood fad that got people jumping onto its bandwagon, but just as how computer graphics has to be inherent in the first TRON movie, the updates of the franchise has to keep up with the times, and in true reel mimicking real life, The Grid pops up in more than 2 dimensions, starting with the light cycle wars that include an additional dimension to consider, which makes for some thrilling action, both on or under the ground and in the air, rather than just becoming a mere special effect.But I had to admit my personal hook line and sinker to watch this film, is the soundtrack by Daft Punk. It stands out most definitely throughout the film, and provided additional lift. It's a character in itself without which the film wouldn't be half as exciting or watchable, with rousing themes to stoke your expectations with its pomp. Their musical contribution and its importance cannot be more than overstated, and is a critical ingredient to why I had enjoyed this film so much to put it as a late consideration into one of the best this year has to offer.\",\n",
       " 'I must begin with the explanation of why i\\'m giving the full note to the movie-i wasn\\'t the biggest fan of the original Tron (1982) when i saw it, and even though i didn\\'t expect much from the sequel, i was eager to see it, because i am a fan, a huge admirer of Olivia Wilde\\'s and because the timeframe reminded me of another movie, i wasn\\'t so keen to see, last year.A movie, which then turned out to be one of the fullest movies of the year-full of both heart and soul.I even saw it the same day-on the 19-th last year.And i said to myself, there were too many things alike, such as the fact i saw Legacy\\'s trailer at the teather, just before the beginning of Avatar-too many things to throw away such an opportunity.So today i went, and i was totally blown away by, by almost everything.I guess that\\'s what happens when you see a movie you didn\\'t expect to be something special, but that wasn\\'t the case.The experience itself was special-and not in terms in time and date and likeness but in terms of quality.The costumes, the effects, the music, the tone of the movie were special.The actors were the thing i actually wanted to be a little better.I always felt strange, seeing a Jeff Bridges movie-he clearly can act and is a great actor, but i don\\'t like his style very much.I quite expected he would be the show-stealing actor, but i was wrong.It was the beautiful and stunning Olivia Wilde.I am a fan of hers and i always knew she is a great actress with huge potential, but was sad, so to say, by the fact she was great in TV-shows mostly-in House or the O.C. she\\'s great, and now she put that passion in a big project so her talent can be visible for audiences around the world.She has great looks and is a skillfull actress.Only by the look of her eyes i felt what she feels, and that\\'s very important.The bond, the connection with the people, ordinary people in the audience like me was so real and was what left us wanting for more even from other movies.She did that, a thing only a handful of people can do.That\\'s what makes her such important for the movie.I know it sounds cliché but she is really the only woman for this role.No one else could\\'ve done it better.Garrett Hedlund, or Sam, was also interesting to see-a fact, i didn\\'t see from the trailers-he has potential and he showed that in the movie.And i forgot to check who played Zuse, but i\\'m sure it was Michael Sheen, because only he is so crazy and unique in his style.He brought brilliancy and sheer entertainment in his role, it was something great to see.When we talk about the people behind the movie, we must pay a huge credit of the rookie director Joseph Kosinski.Disney made another brilliant gambling move, that\\'s paying off.The man knows what he\\'s doing and the studio was aware of that fact.I\\'m paying a huge debt to him for the effects as well, because he works with computer generated imagery, also a specialty of his.It will be an interesting thing, to follow his upcoming career moves and projects-he\\'ll become a big face, i\\'m sure of that.All in all production and effects were great, some fresh faces were introduced and some-rediscovered in this one-hell-of-a-ride sequel, which will stand in mind for a long time to come.Avatar and Tron formed a Christmas movie-going tradition, that one only could hope continues the next year and the one afterwards(a little bit like Saw & PA\\'s Halloween traditions).We, moviegoers, can only hope for things to continue in this direction, because you\\'ve brought warmth to this moviegoer\\'s heart during winter-time.I hope people like Joseph Kosinski and Garrett Hedlund continue develop, Jeff Bridges to keep making strange, but otherwise captivating roles, and last but not least, Olivia Wilde to progress, because, she\\'s not just another beautiful face, but a mesmerizing actress as well, who can heaten up a fan\\'s heart and a woman with such skills, suitable for both the big screen and TV-such diversity is rare to see these days.She\\'s something special.I know i\\'m not objective, but this must and is visible for many people i know and is now visible for everyone.So, all the best for her, and all the cast and crew behind the movie.Because you made one hell of a movie.The new Christmas movie-going tradition is here.And cheers for it.Cheers for \"Tron : Legacy\"My grade:A deserved 10/10',\n",
       " 'In the 28 years since the original Tron movie, there have been, oh, a few innovations in the world of computers, networks, electronics, and communications. But somehow, the makers of this sequel seem to have missed inventions such as \"The World Wide Web\". They passed on a tremendous opportunity to make \"Tron Legacy\" as innovative and powerful as the original. Instead, they\\'ve merely sullied our memories by reducing what was a tremendous and ominous world into the digital equivalent of Smalltown, USA.In 1982, few people had computers, far fewer had even heard of computer networks, and hardly anyone outside the military had heard of \"the internet.\" The creators of the original movie crafted an entire alternate plane of existence, accessible only to computer programmers, in a time when the words \"virtual\" and \"reality\" both still meant \"true.\" Their inspired fantasy gave audiences an entirely new perspective on the nascent digital age. The original\\'s bold, limitless universe, is limited in the sequel to \"The Grid\", a small city from which good guys escape from effortlessly, and from which bad guys seem to have no trouble leaving, though you\\'re given the impression it never occurred to them to look beyond the borders of their extremely small town before. And the entire world is wholly disconnected from any computer system used by anyone on Earth. The only link to reality is the exact same machine hidden in a forgotten room. It\\'s as if the film-makers hoped we\\'d forget that now, 30 years later, almost EVERYONE is on a computer network in one way or another. The original Tron also created real tension by crafting a plot where what happened inside the system mattered. Even before the original Jeff Bridges character was sucked into the digital netherworld, the audience had a palpable sense of the impending doom to all humanity posed by the growing strength of the computer network. In this sequel, the \"real-world\" angle is a lame-duck corporation\\'s unapologetically pathetic efforts at keeping market share. Even that side story introduced in the beginning, isn\\'t given any relevance to anything that happens in the rest of the movie. The larger threat of a digital character emerging from \"The Grid\" into the real world is repeated throughout the film, but never in a credible way. Why should we be scared about him getting out? What would he do here? How would a computer program have any power outside a computer system?There were endless ways the filmmakers could have used today\\'s globally integrated technologies and on-line mania to make Tron Legacy as relevant as the original. The bad guys could have tried to empower Wii systems to control people instead of the other way around, or to animate an army of Second Life avatars, or to rewrite all of Wikipedia to brainwash every student in America, or to take control of every electronic device on Earth (think Y2K).Tron Legacy has dazzling visual graphics, but it falls into that disappointing category of films that match astronomically high priced production values with cut-rate B-movie plots, acting, and character development. Saddest of all is that no one bothered to spend a dime of those hundreds of millions of dollars to follow the true legacy of Tron: to inspire us with the possibilities of where the next digital universe might take us.',\n",
       " \"In a sentence: Go watch the original. Unlike this sterilized computer generated FX production, it has a soul, and a script.I had high hopes for TRON Legacy to rise above the many FX/3D releases that seem to flood the theaters lately. Afterall, TRON harnessed computer generated graphics nearly 30 years ago- and at that time, it was ground breaking. But now? sure, the graphics are improved, but so is every similar FX assisted production since 1982. Computers are faster, designers have more cpu power to play with, and 3D projection systems finally hit it right. But what about everything else that makes a movie? like.. a plot?Sadly, TRON is just another casualty of eye candy. Whether it is the sublime virtual world which rehashes 28 year old ideas infused with modern pixel engines, or the pretty and naive Ms. Wilde tucked in her tights and serving as the Megan Fox of Tronville- TRON does not fly. It grudgingly crawls through a plot that is as expected and transparent as government propaganda: there's good, there's bad, there's conflict, and there's the evident triumph of good over evil. In the way, we meet characters which serve no point, have neither depth nor lifespan, and have nothing but to provide except for additional FX opportunities. TRON closely follows the footsteps of AVATAR: a technological demo with a script that can fit in a brochure. Stunningly boring.The ultimate star of the show, Bridges, tries hard but can't pull the plot on his own. Once in a while, he utters a notable comment with a hint of Big Lebowski which draws a few smiles, but has no one else in the cast to play with. Wilde plays a sexy role muttering a 3rd grader script, while Hedlund's role is the juvenile irresponsible punk with Brad Pitt and Robin Hood aspirations- leaving zero aftertaste. The only other memorable actor (besides Bridges) is Michael Sheen, which we're blessed with for far too few moments. Blame Disney for that choice.Tron Legacy is a waste of time. 28 years ago, Tron felt as if it had been brought back from the future. The new incarnation is technology demo, with sprinkles of Bridges and a remarkable sound track. Do yourself a favor and watch something else.\",\n",
       " 'I like the first Tron. Not in an creepy over-obsessed way, but I regard it as a campy, retro glitterfest based on an delightfully silly idea. The basic concept stays the same in Tron Legacy. Computer programs are sentient beings inside the computer grid, probably deriving from the fact that they are created from someone\\'s hope and dreams and therefore inherit some of their creators (or \"users\")soul. In the first Tron a \"user\", Flynn/Jeff Bridges, is whisked away into the computer world (by lasers, no less). In \"Legacy\" the son of Flynn is looking for his father 20 years after he strangely disappeared without a trace. No price for guessing where, and we also find ourselves in the computer world after a quite glum and outstretched intro. FINALLY.Turns out the world inside is equally glum. Now, with the way the use of computer have evolved and increased dramatically since the last movie I was expecting to see a grid teeming with all sorts of life and variety. That may be my mistake. I realize that the world in Tron Legacy may in fact be the sole creation of one being (Flynn/Jeff Bridges) with no interaction with the rest of the world, which may be plausible,given the theme of the movie, but still. Flynn copy/paste a lot and is obviously very fond of the \"dark-gritty-stone-tool\".All that aside, there been notables upgrades in the Tron world. Most technology looks, well, cooler. It is stunning visually, especially in 3d. My biggest gripe with the movie though is how clunky everything is. This should be a rendition of the world inside a computer, but stuff hisses, creaks and spew exhaustion. When did the digital world turn so analogue? Sure, from a scientific point of view the digital is indistinguishable from the analogue if it is complex enough, but why does it feels like a step backwards? The world in the older movie actually feels like a much more accurate rendition of a computer world than this. The new one is more like reality with fancy neon. Flynn turns his personal abode into a reality shrine, and eating what I guess is a virtually crafted pig, but that is him emulating reality. The motor of the first movie was that we could see games and programs run \"as if it was in real life\". With todays graphics that is already happening on-screen so the movie might have outlived its gimmick. If so there are more than enough other features from the digital world worthy of being represented in Tron. Why just demote the whole world then?I realise I haven\\'t said anything about the acting. Well, there is none. Bridges tries his best to put some personality into Flynn. Not an easy task. Most of the time he just seems awkward. Our protagonist, whats-his-face, Sam is the sulky and estranged techno-wizz-kid we have all seen so many times before, only a bit older this time (27). The Tron from the title is there naturally, and he does... nothing. Boxlietner is in the cast, why not let him give old Tron a line at least? In the male world of computers there are as many as two female actor, but they are just the standard blockbuster version of the madonna/whore, aka spunky and bitchy. That boils down to sourpuss, hippie, spunky, bitchy, a creepy game-character and oh, there is also a Bowie, although not thee Bowie. Hello Disney, NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING SOME DIMENSIONS TO YOUR CHARACTERS, AND I DO NOT MEAN 3D, OK?Frankly, I\\'m thoroughly annoyed, and though not expecting much also surprisingly disappointed. Ah, well. The 4/10 is for looks, sounds and effort. It do look nice and the soundtrack is marvellous at times. I\\'m convinced that the musicians Daft Punk would make a better version of Tron themselves AND with more heart.',\n",
       " 'First things first, I was lucky enough to be able to go to the pre-premier in Amsterdam and watched the movie in IMAX and I highly recomand watching it in this format.Basicly what you are watching is a movie that almost seems to aim to be the next terrible tween trilogy. But... the story is not half bad. Filled with plotholes, obnoxious characters and refusing to explain just WHY THEY HAVE TO DRIVE THEIR CITIES!? but overall enjoyable.The true attrection however is the scenery and boy is it worth it. The cities look amazing, the planes, buildings and everything in the film is dressed to impress. It made me want to crawl through the screen and just marvel at the beauty of it all.So yeah! The movie is kinda like watching an anime like Howls moving castle without subtitles. I have no idee what they are trying to say but it sure looks nice.',\n",
       " \"I loved the idea, cities eating each other, but it hardly happens, the idea is introduced and then forgotten. The concept was great but I think Peter Jackson has lost the ability to adapt books. Lord of the Rings worked because the kept to the story and adapted it for screen, the Hobbit didn't work because they extended it into a bloated monster for screen and Mortal Engines fails because they have changed the story so much to make a their movie version. I didn't mind it when I first saw it, it's an ok film with great ideas that it doesn't really capitalise on but then I read the book.....The nuanced villain has become almost comic book, despite Hugo Weaving's best efforts and the changes to make the Star Wars like ending took the tragedy from the finale. Hester seems hollow and her affection for Tom seems forced. Tom doesn't get to be our unwitting hero, with all his bravery that breaks down Hester removed and the tragic end is turned into an explosive pyrotechnic fest. Even Shrike's story is broken for no good reason, just to make Valentine even more evil and Tom less heroic. What a shame.So, if you've not read the book, give it a go - there are far worse films - if you have, beware.\",\n",
       " \"In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much from Mortal Engines.A film that feels like it's come out too late in the dystopian piece, this Peter Jackson produced blockbuster has had a tough time convincing audiences that they should spend their hard earned dollars on catching it while it plays in cinemas but despite my low expectations and willingness to be pleasantly surprised, Engines left me cold, empty and rather disappointed in that it failed so miserably in giving its world a chance to succeed.So many elements of debut director Christian Rivers cinematic tale feel underutilised, under-cooked and under-developed, as we are quickly introduced to a future world landscape where humans have decided to build moving cities and roam the planet searching for resources, after a cataclysmic event wiped out a large portion of Earth's population and civilisations.Before you have much of chance to blink, we're introduced to a moving London, Hugo Weaving's scheming Thaddeus Valentine, Robert Sheehan's kind-hearted history buff Tom Natsworthy and Hera Hilmar's main protagonist Hester Shaw, who seeks vengeance against Valentine for past wrongs but in around all these introductions and numerous by the numbers action scenes, there's carefully little time spent on making any of it matter, disallowing us an audience to ever feel even slightly invested in what occurrences take place.Its all seriously frustrating, as this steampunk world seems like one that's open for exploration and the film often looks visually stunning thanks to the VFX work and set design, but it's a cold and far to basically developed universe to feel lived in and alive.Rivers struggles to explain why humanity decided its best option was to develop a collection of moving cities, there's almost no talk of what happened before these cities took shape and who on earth are the ancient ones and why does a Terminator named Shrike decide to adopt a human child?These are just some of the questions and thoughts that for some reason the team behind Engines decided not to answer and you can't help but escape the feeling that a first time director wasn't the storyteller required to bring Philip Reeve's novel to the big screen, with trite dialogue, awkward pacing and bad performances a staple of this film that could've been.You can sense the actors struggling with the material and while the only recognisable faces in the piece in the forms of Weaving and a motion captured Stephan Lang try their best gruff guy takes, relative newcomers Hilmar and Sheehan fail to inspire, while Asian megastar Jihae comes in too late in the piece to add any real spark to the piece as her rebellious pilot Anna Fang.Final Say -At its best a half-baked attempt to create a unique new movie universe, that's only saving graces are some neat visual flourishes, Mortal Engines is close to an entirely charmless and lifeless exercise in big budget filmmaking that appears destined to be one of the growing number of high profile failures of 2018.2 Minions out of 5\",\n",
       " \"December is often the month to look out for one of Peter Jackson's fantasy spectacles since he and his writing partners Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh revived the genre 17 years ago with The Fellowship of the Ring. He has since treated us to two superior sequels, a pretty solid King Kong remake, and an underestimated Hobbit trilogy. A year ago we already saw teaser trailers for Mortal Engines, which did what teasers should do: they make us hungry. And of course, it had Jackson's name proudly displayed all over it. But don't let that fool you, because he didn't direct this one.That is no problem in itself, because Jackson on the producer's seat gave us the masterful District 9 (another underrated gem worth watching) and The Adventures of Tintin (technically a Spielberg movie, but still). However, in this case, his script contribution and Christian Rivers on the director's chair are by far the biggest problems of the movie.A world where huge cities are turned into moving vehicles sounds like something that could be very cinematic, and indeed, it looks great on screen. Especially the parts where a huge predator city swallows and recycles a smaller one is exactly the kind of imagery that the makers must have envisioned. There are more beautiful locations in the film, like a city in the air, some good ideas and action scenes, and the film sells these things well enough for me not to question the logic of it. But this is as far as good worldbuilding goes, because the (back)story and characters are used in a most uninspired fashion.A good director knows how to balance exposition with advancing the narrative, but Rivers clearly lacks such talent. The first 15 minutes are a barrage of expository conversations with clearly no other purpose than bringing the audience up to speed. Afterwards, the characters remain nothing more than one-dimensional archetypes throughout the movie (the silent heroin, the young hero with an unfulfilled talent, the hammy villain with world-domination ideas, the brown-nosing creep), and some even disappear from the film without any narrative consequence, which says something about the quality of the script (more about that later).A cast full of fresh faces is usually a good thing compared to miscast band of A-listers, but most of the bit players get too little screentime or act too badly to make a good impression. A band of racially diverse heroes is introduced very late in the story, which is a mistake because the movie doesn't emotionally invest in them, so we couldn't care less about their fate. Not that the actor's direction is of any help, by the way. Hera Hilmar is downright boring and unbelievable as the tough protagonist, and Hugo Weaving does a uninspired bad guy act that fails to generate any sympathy. Robert Sheehan as Tom seems to be the only one having some fun with his role.There is not much joy to get from the storytelling part either, as the by-the-numbers plot clearly took a backseat to the visuals here. Most dystopian sci-fi movies make grateful use of their universe's mythology, and the beginning is promising. But the backstory is quickly used as an excuse to have the villains search for a very powerful item, with the heroes drawn in to stop them through way too many badly written coincidences. If this sounds like a cheap version of The One Ring, you're not wrong.To spice up the heroine's motivations, they invented a dead-end subplot featuring some sort of green Terminator, but like lots of other things in this movie, this is just a nice idea, badly developed, and thrown in without proper motivation or catharsis. The film takes itself much too seriously with hardly any moderating humor, and the cheesiness towards the end becomes so bad that the 'shocking revelation' (a clear rip-off from another fantasy series) amounts to absolutely nothing.How a big studio allowed this film to be helmed by a storyboard artist with only two short film segments under his belt is anyone's guess. I assume Rivers was accomplished enough as an artist to sway them with his intended look for the film (which is absolutely the most positive part of the film). Jackson probably vouched for him, and got poor Hugo Weaving involved to secure the budget. Jackson shouldn't be blamed completely for giving promising talent a chance, but he, Boyens and Walsh should seriously contemplate their contributions to the screenplay. Three Oscar-winning writers who managed to get the unfilmable Lord of the Rings novels to the screen should be able to do substantially better than this.I know we have been spoiled by series like Game Of Thrones where there is ample time to set up story, subplots and characters, something that is always challenging in a 2-hr movie. But when you want to start a new fantasy franchise, at least put a certified cook in the kitchen who knows how to balance the ingredients, and prevent it from becoming the next Golden Compass.\",\n",
       " \"I already know it's gonna get bashed for seemingly ripping off elements of Star Wars, but I think It's kind of an unfair criticism and I loved the film. Let's get that part over first: there are at least two main elements that might make you think Star Wars near the end. They're somewhat similar but not really the same and play out differently in a very different setting with different components.So I thought the high concept of the movie - motorized cities rolling on land - might seem ridiculous, but I gotta admit it worked for me and made the movie feel fresh. That starting chase sequence between the two towns was original and memorable. There were other spectacular action sequences, including one involving buzzsaws, with great special effects, but I gotta admit the melee fights were weak as they were of the chaotic, frantic-cut variety, except perhaps those involving Shrike that were better. Regarding that undead cyborg Shrike, I loved pretty much everything about him: his look, the way he moved, his back story and his story arc. Probably my favorite character, but the others were interesting too, and the acting was solid overall.The production design was excellent with several fascinating cities and/or vehicles with a certain steampunk design vibe. Special mention to the location where the giant London tank threads passed. Visual effects were outstanding with sights you might never have seen before. Music was very good and appropriately grand when called for. I liked the story despite feeling a slight déjà-vu in the last part. This future world creation based on the novels was very well portrayed and captivating to me, and I wanted to learn more about it. Overall, the film was a very nice surprise, quite different than the usual sci-fi/fantasy blockbuster, at least in its setting. To be honest, until the last act I was going to recommend this film without any real reserves, but then it felt as if had to explain certain things.Rating: 8.5 out of 10 (Remarkable)\",\n",
       " \"So way in the future, people live in big mechanical machines on wheels. And one of the bigger cities: London, has got some rather unsavory plans.Mortal Engines looks pretty good. The house-machines look awesome, especially the big ones. We are treated to some fine shots. Grandiose stuff. That's cool.\\nThe action is alright, nothing too special, but at times it's quite exciting. There is one fight scene though and I gotta say: someone did NOT get the memo that we don't use a million cuts any more. But there isn't that much fighting anyway, so it's not a big problem. The action that's on a bigger scale is much better. The effects look good, except from some greenscreen stuff that will not age well. (remember that one scene in King Kong? Jeeesh)This movie really is a mixed bag. On one side it's got some creative, original ideas, on the other some overused clishees.\\nFor every creative element, there's a cringy line or two.The characters are okay, can't say I liked anyone to a very big extent..Although Hugo Weaving does have some charisma.\\nWhat's with that Tom guy? Sorry, but I just didn't like his face. Reminded me of a ventriloquist dummy, or something. Dunno.Mortal Engines does have a cool atmosphere about it that I liked. But it is a little long, and there is especially one plot element that fell totally flat, although it was supposed to be very moving. It wasn't.All in all a decent movie, sure to entertain at least some people.\",\n",
       " 'Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick\\'s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to \"retire\" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as \"Replicants\".  The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director\\'s cut to boot.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.Ridley Scott\\'s hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant.  It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil.  Corruption is everywhere.  The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we\\'ve seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.There is a hint of style from the 40\\'s, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music.  Rachael\\'s entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40\\'s.The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues.  This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.The special effects were exceptional.  Much of the set was pulled off using models.  In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  These guys really knew what they were doing.  I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it.  Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford.  I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role.  His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director\\'s Cut).  Rutger Hauer\\'s performance was intense.  His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical.  Daryl Hannah\\'s chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.There is more to this film than just pulp.  It works on so many remarkable levels.  The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live?  Why do I have to die?  What happens when I die? Doesn\\'t my maker care?  Is this all merely an illusion?  At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant.  Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today.  In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success.',\n",
       " \"This is simply Scott's finest hour. There are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. Films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with cliché upon cliché and often miss the whole point. What Ridley Scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. It really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by Phillip K Dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). Its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven't quite made the grade for the off world colonies. We have a true smelting pot of nationalities.The heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.This film also sees Ford in perfect casting.Theirs a rye charm that Ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. Its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. For me,the directors cut is simply too cut. I preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. The finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by Batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by Ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. No other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. It captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. From the chase scene with Zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot. This is my favourite movie of all time for all the reasons above and many more i could effortlessly type all day and night.\",\n",
       " \"I have an interest in science fiction films and TV programmes. I like shows like (the original) Star Wars trilogy, (most of) the Star Trek films, as well as Star Trek TV series (Voyager for modern times,preferably, as it had the least number of useless episodes), etc. In my experience, most SF material turns out to be distilled garbage. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a masterpiece. I am not hesitant to say that I blatantly dislike Spielberg's definition of SF- ET, Close Encounters, & (worst of all) War Of The Worlds. Neither do I appreciate any 'Alien' film apart from R Scott's 1979 original (although Alien2 was OK)-Alien vs Pred is a disgrace not only to all genres, but to the film industry itself. So when I heard of Blade Runner on the net, I wondered; what could be so good about this film? I have HBO,Cinemax, Star Movies- yet this film has never been shown. So, I got myself the Director's Cut at the local video store. I watched it once. Then I re-watched it two days later. My verdict: This film is fantastic.It is one of the greatest films ever made, on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Upon 1st viewing, new audiences may be bewildered. One anticipates a futuristic run-of-the-mill 80's shoot-em-up (in the like of Outland,say). What you get is a film so deep that it is difficult to grasp the 1st time. There is so much symbolism, introverts and questions that I was left stunned. The film is hauntingly beautiful, and I doubt that these screen landscapes could be reproduced today as well as they were here. The plot centres around the question of humanity- something we take for granted. It is not an auctioneer, which was probably what audiences expected when they walked into theatres in the 80s, causing the film to fail commercially. Blade Runner is not for the adrenaline junkie, nor for those who like flashy gadgets and bright explosions, with a healthy Hollywood-made dose of convincing storyline spoon-fed for their satisfaction.The film is set in the apocalyptic, suggestively post-war future Earth, where there seems to be a lag in technology. Perhaps there was a war which ravaged the world, forcing humans to migrate (the cramped cultural richness of LA), and rebuild, explaining the retro technology. 6 'Criminal' Nexus 6 replicates (genetically engineered humanoids), hijack a ship and come to Earth seeking their maker. These slaves(machines/automatons// regard them as anything which has been created by Man to lessen his burden) have developed emotions, and they fear death for they cherish their memories (Think robots weeping over photographs). Their cause: They want a longer life, they want to experience more, they want to be... human.Enter Rick Deckard, Blade Runner. His job: kill trespassing replicates; Kill living, breathing humanoids composed of flesh and blood who only have 4 years to live out their miserable lives, seeking haven on Earth rather than serving as slaves in mining outposts on Mars. Kill? Murder seems more appropriate. But that's his job. replicates which trespass are a hazard. These 6 replicates have killed 23 people and hijacked a ship. They have to be killed, right? If you're planning to take sides in this film, you will be pleasantly if not unnervingly surprised. There are no sides. There is no good and evil. Harrison Ford plays the reluctant, burned out Blade Runner very well. His character is drab and dull, as it was meant to be; look at him in the Spinner on the way to Tyrell corporation- pure boredom. He hates his job. If there were any narration, it Should sound dull and uninteresting, reflecting his character. Rutger Hauer gives the greatest performance of his career (so far) in this film, playing Roy Batty, Replicant 'project manager'. He dominates the later part of the film. He is cold, stiff and evil, but in the end speech, one of the Greatest endings I have ever seen, his performance alone makes this film a Classic. The ending is beautiful, and the score by Vangelis is perfect.All in all, the film is excellent. Well directed by Ridley Scott, innovative and stunning imagery underlined by Vangelis' superb score, and plenty to think about (on your own- no spoon feeding). Check out the trivia for this film; scientists voted it better than 2001:A Space Odyssey. Is the quest for humanity a crime? Find out for yourself. Blade Runner is a Must-Watch, and a Must-Have film.My rating: 8.9 / 10 Thank you for your time. Kris\",\n",
       " 'Sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance, even if it is 20 years later! Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc \"Complete Collector\\'s Edition\" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn\\'t often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this \"restored\" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I\\'ve heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called \"Jacob\\'s Ladder.\"Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The \"Collector\\'s Edition\" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and \"is the version I\\'m most pleased with.\" It has added scenes one didn\\'t see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late \\'40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that\\'s what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art.Scott says this is the best version and the best his film has ever looked and sounded. Since it\\'s his movie, who am I to argue. So, if you\\'re like me and never gave this movie a chance (I lost interest halfway through with my VHS look at it), give this a second look on this Blu-Ray edition....and you will be blown away. This is, indeed, an amazing film.',\n",
       " 'Holy Cow! We\\'ve finally got the Wolverine movie we\\'ve all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we\\'ve seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres. Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan\\'s eyes and what a ride it turns out to be. This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we\\'ve seen before. In this case, that\\'s a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other \"dark\" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves. I loved everything about this movie and they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh\\'s run.',\n",
       " 'The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of \"The Wolverine\" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it\\'s getting.When I saw the first trailer drop, headlined by Johnny Cash\\'s \"Hurt\", I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come. The introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen, and though doesn\\'t say much, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better, especially seen in certain scenes.Lastly, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen, it would be better for everyone if they didn\\'t re-cast the role, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman. Overall, Mangold and the cast, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe.',\n",
       " \"I absolutely love this show. Not only it does have an amazing humor, but the animation is sublime. We can quickly relate to the characters and experience some greatly written adventures! I can assure you'll quickly become addicted to this show.Both Ladybug and Chat Noir embody the concept of super heroes, without being flaw free unlike some other shows that make no sense. They're nice kids under those masks, and that's just another bonus. Their chemistry will capture your heart!I'd perhaps work more on the main villain, give him more shots /different animation screen time? Otherwise, it's just what animation needed! I'm honestly tired of bad animated shows that show characters with no substance. Ladybug and Chat Noir are a new, exciting addition to television! I'm looking forward to what they'll do next!\",\n",
       " 'I stumbled upon Miraculous while I was baby-sitting one day, with the kid that I was watching telling me \"watch this show it is the best\". So to not disappoint her, I did. Needless to say, I wasn\\'t disappointed in myself, in fact - I loved it. Ladybug has a fascinating story about a teenage girl named Marinette who got chosen to be a superhero named Ladybug along with an accomplice Cat-Noir. Each episode explores a simple issue in a real life situation experienced by a person, then dramatizes it with a villain who uses the issue to try and defeat the heroes through the person experiencing it. It\\'s that simple formula which makes the show exciting especially since you know roughly what will happen each episode. Through the 20 minute episodes, a couple of minutes is dedicated to explore Marinette\\'s personal life as a shy teenage schoolgirl which builds a great likability to her character. However, the show isn\\'t perfect. It gets really repetitive after a while since every episode has the same formula. Although this was fixed in the final two episodes where a villain was stretched out to two episodes to defeat, giving more time to empathize with Marinette the main character, but the rest of season one didn\\'t really do that. The other problem is how the episodes barely give enough time to do character building with the supporting characters and instead focuses on how to defeat the villain, instead of the consequences of not defeating them (excluding the final 2 episodes of season 1). In saying that, it\\'s not that the show is bad, but with enough work it can easily reach the heights of other great animations such as Avatar the Last Airbender. All in all, Miraculous is a great show - one of the best I\\'ve seen in this last decade. Season one may have felt a bit repetitive, but there were moments which were definitely worth remembering and the final two episodes of season one definitely set some standards for season two.',\n",
       " 'I hugely appreciate this french TV show. It is funny, contains lots of adventures and mysteries. Moreover, there are love stories that make this show even more attractive. Some ideas are very good and the bad guys are nothing but great characters most of the time. The theme song is so catchy. Special effects, drawings, colors, stories, there is nothing i am able to hate in Miraculous!One thing that i really like is the relationship between Adrien and Marinette.Also, the fact that action takes place in Paris reminds me of my home, which is quite moving sometimes. Enjoy it as much as i do.',\n",
       " \"I went into this movie having no clue what it was about and wasn't expecting much, but I loved it.There are innumerable movies with huge budgets that simply fall flat, and Upgrade, with a Budget of around $5,000,000, which doesn't cover the cost of catering on some of these huge budgeted flops, honestly looked like it cost a lot more than it actually did.Intelligent script, good action, very few unnecessary scenes, and though I thought it was sure to let me down, a very good ending.And although I have seen much of Logan Marshall-Green's work and was never a huge fan, he does a very good job here.Recommended.\",\n",
       " \"Brilliant.This movie is proof that you don't need all the special effects in the world to make an amazing sci fi movie. This is low budget done right (think Ex Machina). I signed up to IMDB to review this movie, I was that impressed. I see tons of people making that remark about films but honestly, this movie is unbelievable and for any sci fi fan out there, you need to watch this. I went in blind, no trailer, no knowledge of the movie what so ever and I would advise you do the same. The plot is simple, it's a revenge story that's been done countless times, yet it feels so fresh, acting Is slightly suspect throughout the first 10-15 minutes but the story will grip you, be patient. Honestly, I don't want to give anything away so just watch this movie.9.5/10 Easily my favourite sci fi for a LONG time.Enjoy.\",\n",
       " \"As stories go, Upgrade isn't anything particularly spectacular. There's some really good ideas of course, but the idea of cyborgs and AI taking over humanity are as old as technology itself. It also surprisingly draws parallels to a superhero movie released in the same year; Venom, where a normal Tom Hardy-looking guy finds himself possessed by an entity that helps him get what he wants by controlling his body. Where Upgrade really shines is in its execution. The build-up leading to multiple multi-layered twists upon each other lend the film an unpredictable narrative complexity, where multiple rewatches are guaranteed to illuminate more subtle complexities, callbacks, and foreshadowing.Something that really makes Upgrade stand out is Logan Marshall-Green, who offers a truly impressive physical performance that is both demanding and complicated to achieve. The controlling of his body by an AI leads to some stylish fight choreography, and Marshall-Green doesn't stutter in adding robotic, calculated movements to those scenes, while simultaneously acting in juxtaposition with his head and facial expressions. He's confused and bewildered while he slices a guy up with a kitchen knife, he brags and gloats while his body effortlessly dispatches of goons, he pleads with bad guys not to continue fighting while his robotic-moving arms quickly and decisively disarm and dispatch of them. He holds such an impressive disconnect between his head and his body that I couldn't even imagine how hard it must have been to develop such physical coordination while acting and making it look effortless at the same time. Marshall-Green has never particularly impressed me before, but he has now.Even further though are clever uses of cameras adding another dimension to the film's visual identity. The high points are, again, the fight scenes, where the camera is just as involved in the choreography as the actors and stuntmen are. To add an even greater emphasis on the disconnect between Grey's mind and his body, the camera often keeps him fixed in frame while the settings around him movie. He's just enjoying the ride while his body does the moving, and we're put in that mindset. The way they did it is mount the camera in a rotating frame, hide a phone on Marshall-Green's body, and get them to match orientation. When Marshall-Green moves, the camera moves with him. This becomes especially impressive when Grey ducks and dives, or does full-on back-flips, and the camera mirrors his movements perfectly.Beyond that, the cinematography goes a long way to make this low-budget movie look much more expensive. Lighting is dim and harsh, camera angles are conservative yet stylish, and the CGI is used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, which has a knock-on effect of grounding an otherwise futuristic world without getting too lofty. The score by Jed Palmer is also fantastic. I was maybe a little disappointed that Whannell didn't go for a Saw-esque climatic track for the third-act revelations, but nonetheless the score is evocative of sci-fi movies of the 70s and 80s, with borderline synthwave tracks interspersed amongst more ambient sounds.Upgrade is a solid sci-fi flick that manages to be refreshing and unique despite its otherwise overdone story elements. It ended up being a better Venom movie than Venom. All it took was an imaginative filmmaker like Leigh Whannell. I honestly can't wait to see what he manages to do next. I give Upgrade a solid 8/10.\",\n",
       " \"Actor turned newb writer and director Peter Facinelli, wore all three hats in this B-grade film, and although flawed, it was still enjoyable. New filmmakers have to start somewhere, right? This was his 3rd full length feature film, and I've seen much worse from seasoned filmmakers lately. My biggest issue was the terrible acting by Anne Heche and especially Thomas Jane and his changing weird voice, but some of that blame also falls on the inexperience of the newb director not directing his cast and scenes effectively. Overall though, the directing was fairly decent as was the camera work. The cinematography and score were on point. The writing did have some plot and technical issues, and the pacing needed to be faster and/or the films 115 min runtime edited or cut down to around 90 mins. But the overall story with its twists and turns and surprise ending was conceived very well - it was worth the slow pacing and long runtime. If you enjoy mystery thrillers with some scary moments, you will enjoy this one. Watching it a second time knowing the ending is like watching a different movie, which is well put together. Ignore the wannabe critics and their ridiculously low ratings... it's a solid and well deserved 7/10 from me.\",\n",
       " \"Ava is one of those films that is enjoyable, but will quickly be forgotten. It doesn't have any major or glaring flaws, but equally it doesn't have anything extra special that makes it stand out.I absolutely love Jessica Chastain as an actress, and so she was the highlight for me. I thought she brought a good performance to a character who, despite not being too developed, had enough to maintain my interest.The story felt very familiar. If you're into the action genre, you won't find anything ground breaking here. That's not to say it wasn't enjoyable. It was fun to watch, it just hasn't left a lasting impression on me.In terms of the action, once again it was exciting, but it wasn't anything new. There were some pretty decent set pieces and some good fight choreography, and the action was well paced throughout.Ultimately I'm happy I watched Ava. It kept me entertained for an hour and a half, and at the end of the day isn't that why we watch films?\",\n",
       " 'How and why would you take a hit-man (hit-\"person\" to be politically correct) genre that\\'s been done so many times before, screw it up, AND turn it into a soap opera?I mean this whole Michael thing is straight out of \"Days of Our Lives\". Why not create a heartfelt conflict between the sisters and their mom, instead of just seemingly-random cast Common as Michael. Like my heading says, a 5th grader could\\'ve written (and directed) this better. I get that actor/trying-to-become-a-writer Matthew Newton is a newb, but to have such an all-star talent line-up, you\\'d think he would\\'ve at least had a seasoned writer proofread the script to avoid embarrassment. His screenplay was riddled with plot and technical issues, it was convoluted, and borderline laughable. Only in the last approx. 15 mins did it grab and hold my attention.To make matters worse, actor/trying-to-become-a-director Tate Taylor failed miserably in directing his cast, and certain scenes were horribly directed. Don\\'t get me started on the lame action scenes. Right from the start, Jessica Chastain was unconvincing as an assassin, and I know in front of a seasoned director, she would\\'ve nailed it. Even A-list actors need direction in scenes. With Taylor, her fight scenes were phony, as was her character.I feel really bad for the A-listers having this mess on their resume. This type of filmmaking is more suited for the Steven Seagal and Bruce Willis has-been B-movie type actors. Now, watch seasoned filmmaker Luc Besson\\'s \"Anna\", who cast (as a lead!) never-heard-of amateur actress (in her first-ever acting role) Sasha Luss, and his writing, directing and action scenes will blow your mind, especially compared to this mess! The moral of this story here is, don\\'t blow your money on A-list actors in hopes they will make your film a success; instead, put that money towards film school, then cast a Sasha Luss type newb actor, and you\\'ll have a better chance for a successful film. It\\'s a very generous 6/10 from me - mostly out of pity for the A-listers.',\n",
       " \"Ava Starts AWESOME with great international spy assassin action, though it fast lost heat, getting to the level of a soap opera drama with unbelievable amount of tears that i could not like.It should have stayed on track with action, but no.Still, i can admire the effort and above all the all-star cast, that includes the always beautiful Joan Chen, as well as old time fave John Malkovich who fought pretty good when his time came.Jessica Chastain in her main character role as well as her nemesis Colin Farrell also did a good work, as expected from them.The cast even includes two Oscar winners: rapper Common and the forever gorgeous Geena Davis, who at 64 even looked more elegant and stylish than the much younger Chastain during the scene where the two women played cards.So, as you can infer, cast is not a problem. Problem (in my eyes) was the plot that did make this flick and all action thriller. Because the tears and the telenovela subplot deflate the excitement, preventing the film to reach an awesome peak that would have made it truly memorable. That - sadly - did not happen.Nevertheless, the Ava is acceptable, probably the best in offer in cinemas right now. I'd say it'd be worth of your bucks and time.\",\n",
       " \"Assassin films are a genre to themselves at the moment. This one has the full on assassin 'industry' structure of John Wick, but never reaches those heady heights.Chastain and Malkovich turn in good performances and Colin Farrell doesn't do a bad job either.The human element of this film centres around Ava returning to her home and family who have all changed significantly since she left, but this emotion pit is an element of the film that doesn't work so well, although Gena Davis still puts in a good performance there.The sub plot around a bizzare love triangle never really does anything but slow the film down and the gambling issue alone could have provided what was needed without all the additional angst.It's certainly not a bad action film. The fight scenes are well choreographed and don't resort to Matrix style martial arts, and the characters slow down as the fight continues which is something a lot of action films get wrong.It doesn't do anything new for the assassin genre but its not the worst film in it. If you're looking for a decent popcorn film, you could do better; but you could also do a lot worse.\",\n",
       " \"You don't fool me. You might have put Justin Lin at the helm it is so obvious you were pulling the strings. Because everything in this film has your hand print on it. Star Trek Beyond even starts with a freaking lens flare.At this point I had made peace with the new Star Trek and just wanted to enjoy myself. Bring on the spectacle and eye candy. Give me the super slick action and your edge of your seat thrills. All I wanted was to have fun. But no, that would actually require some effort and you could not be bothered huh Abrams? So yes let me be one of those guys complaining that this is not my Star Trek. I have been a fan of the original franchise for a long time. I actually embraced the reboot until Star Trek Into Darkness. Although that did not stop me from enjoying for what they were. Fun popcorn movies but so far removed from what Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek should be about that it simply is not funny anymore. But would you believe it that Beyond even fails as a fun popcorn flick? All the spectacle and eye candy was unimaginative, uninspired and ultimately boring. Yes, you heard me say it. Star Trek Beyond is boring. It had me going for the first ten minutes and then I lost interest completely. There is nothing in this adventure that drew me into these events. I could overlook the minimal story and lack of genuine twist and turns. Although the big one at the end was decent enough if it weren't for the fact that I already had stopped caring about this film entirely. All the characters in this film could have died and I would not have given a damn. Maybe except for Bones. Karl Urban can do no wrong with me. Even if he tried to. But all the other characters got on my nerve. Anton Yelchin's Chekov was a parody of the original. Worse of all though he is not in the film as much as I would have liked to. There isn't a single scene that serves has a proper send off and farewell to the magnificent actor he was. And that pisses me off to be frank. Actually a lot of characters including Chris Pine as Kirk lack the charm and wit from previous films. Spock was more human than Vulcan. Let me remind you people that it was his Vulcan half that made him an interesting character. It was like no one in this production cared about this film at all. Then why should I? Why should I give in and accept this mess of a film?And trust me I tried shutting of my brain and simply enjoy it but I couldn't. Because nothing about this adventure is memorable or exciting. Most important reason is that the spectacle is predictable as hell. Even the Beastie Boys scene you could have seen coming miles ahead. Now I must admit that that scene did put a smile on my face. But one brief moment of joy like that is not enough. Not by a long shot. In order to remain fair I have judged this film solely on what it did offer and not of what it could or should have been. Still I do have to point out that this latest part in the reboot franchise is proof that this is not Star Trek. The older films and TV Shows next to spectacle always offered good drama and thought provoking concepts about many essential things that matter in life. Star Trek made science and philosophy accessible and fun for people who otherwise might not have been interested. Star Trek Beyond however dismisses all of this and treats it's audience like they are idiots. The people behind this new franchise assume current audience only want action and spectacle and nothing more. And maybe this is true which makes me sad. Very sad. I like to be challenged. I like to be provoked about political and social issues when done right. However like I first stated that I was willing and able to overlook the lack of this in favour of fun. But that's just it. Beyond rarely is fun. The very few moments that were could not make me forget the agony I experienced while watching this film. I stared at the screen in such detached manner that I think I would have gotten more enjoyment watching noise.I for one am hoping that they are done with this and that they will go back to what Star Trek should be about. But if they don't the fans will. So many wonderful fan made Star Trek projects out there that are made with love and passion that surpass these crappy movies in every way. Simon Pegg claims to be a huge Star Trek fan. Then it is so puzzling to me that he could have written this script. Almost everything about it is a downright insult to the real fans and legacy of Gene Roddenberry. I never realized this until now but Simon Pegg is kind of a douche. Overall don't bother people. Star Trek Beyond is a giant waste of your time.\",\n",
       " 'I stopped watching this movie after half an hour. This is not Star Trek. Not even close. If you want to make a fun movie about space and lasers and people jumping around like bunnies on LSD just make another Guardians of the galaxy movie. (Wich was a greate movie by the way)Star Trek is about interesting SF concepts and space phenomena, interstellar politics, social interaction with alien races and now and then a space battle. This whole new series of parallel universe Star Trek movies is just a cheap ripoff of one of the best franchises ever made. They cannibalized it for fast profit and killed their long term profit.Even if you would have wanted to bring a bit more action to a new series of Star Trek movies there would have been a more enjoyable way to do this. What people are waiting for decades is the untold story of the Klingon wars. A new series about the Klingon wars would have been the most profitable thing that would have been ever created and all fans would have loved it.Instead they just made a remake of Captain Kirks Star Trek and killed his character.

       " 'With JJ Abrams helming the first two movies in this series, the focus was clearly on characters and ideas (the things that Mr. Abrams does best). With Justin Lin assuming the director\\'s chair this go-round, one could expect that the tone of this third installment would be quite a bit different. It most certainly is, and how much that bothers/excites you will determine where this one ranks on your overall enjoyment list.For a basic plot summary, \"Beyond\" sees the Enterprise and its crew sent on a diplomatic mission (of sorts) to resolve a feud. Upon arriving on the scene, the Enterprise is completely overwhelmed by a type of weapon they have never seen before. With the crew scattered to the winds (after abandoning ship), they must find each other if they have any hope of fighting back against this new enemy.First and foremost, \"Beyond\" is a high-octane action movie. Like I said, one couldn\\'t expect anything different with Lin behind the camera. Indeed, the action sequences are thrilling, he uses the film\\'s music as a perfect compliment, and the visuals are intense. Whereas the previous two films featured much more dialogue and contemplation, \"Beyond\" charges forward more often than not.Here\\'s the thing, though: In order for Star Trek (of any incarnation) to really, really work, it must either A. Tell a really interesting story; or B. Focus almost exclusively on the characters and hope for incredible acting. \"Beyond\" misses the mark on both those accounts.There are snippets of interesting story/concepts in the movie, but they are not focused upon in favor of standard plot machinations and all those action scenes. The rigors of years in space, the concept of the Federation, and the bond between the crew members are all concepts that could have headlined the film, but instead they are kind of just thrown in at times to try to give the proceedings some gravitas. The old \"need to have some down time before the next action scene\" type of directing.In terms of acting, the individual performances are still great, but I found it an odd choice to have the main cast so split up for most of the film. So much is made in \"Beyond\" about teamwork and the closeness of the crew, yet there are precious few scenes where they actually all get to interact with each other.Now, if you are the type of movie-goer who enjoys an action-adventure romp above all else, \"Beyond\" will be much more to your liking. Personally, that isn\\'t my favorite type of movie experience, so I really wish that it would have done a better job at picking a main plot focus and sticking too it. That isn\\'t Lin\\'s forte, however, so I can\\'t say I\\'m all that surprised by how this one turned out.A final thought on \"Beyond\" is that I know it was rushed a bit to get into theaters corresponding with Star Trek\\'s 50th anniversary. I wonder if perhaps that could explain why the writing felt a bit stunted and uninspiring. The bottom line, however, is that it really doesn\\'t have that \"Bad Robot feel\" to it like other films that have come from the now-famous production company. It likely will do well enough to not kill off this line of films entirely, but the fourth adventure will have some significant proving to do that it can get back to great storytelling along with the action.',\n",

       " \"Here, the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an Indianajonesesque adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The most visually rich part of the film was the opening scenes set in ancient Egypt. I would love to see an entire film built around that. The sets and costumes were brilliant.Especially tantalizing is the strictly painted-on attire of Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namum; what a stunning visual; but it completely upstages her performance. I have heard people talking about it. Some have mistakenly guessed her top was a mesh costume of some sort; not true, it is entirely - and only - paint.But Velazquez isn't the only thing to turn heads in the film, Rachel Weisz is appropriately attractive, though not as startling; her character is as solid and believable as she is lovely.The newcomer, Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bey, set quite a few female hearts aflutter; in our party, at least. The internet was lit-up searching for more photos of this guy.At first, I didn't particularly care for Brendan Fraser as the primary character (he's too well kept and cutesy for a rugged guy-type for me), be he grows on you. He seems to be developing into a versatile actor who will be around for a long time. His work here is good too.The special effects were the real star of the film, and they were visually rewarding and complimented the story in the right way in the right places. How Arnold Vosloo dealt with those in his role as the mummy Imhotep should be acknowledged. He must have had to imagine quite a bit of what he was interacting with to pull it off, and he does so with great style and substance for this type of role. He was nothing short of excellent.In fact, most of the remaining characters were well chosen. Jonathan Hyde and Kevin J. O'Connor added to the film in important ways, too. Together, everyone painted an enjoyable film, delivering exactly what it promised; fun, action, and adventure.\",\n",

I loved The Mummy because it's one of those roller coaster rides were you just jump on and never let go. The Mummy is a remake of the 1932 mummy which starred Boris Karloff who played imhotep. The Mummy is about an expedition of treasure seeking explorers in the Sahara desert in 1925. They stumble upon an ancient tomb, the hunters without knowing set loose a 3,000 year-old inheritance of terror, which is personified in the vengeful reincarnation of an Egyptian priest who had been sentenced to an infinity as one of the living dead. I love watching this movie in 1999 at the big screen. This movie made me love Egypt a lot. I guarantee this movie a classic. Do not compare this with the 1932 movie.

       " 'The Mummy is a great summer adventure for nonstop thrills and kicks. It has a lot of humour; memorable comedic performances (Brendan Fraser), fantastic settings and surprisingly striking CGI for 1999. There is little technically wrong with this film other than that is clearly borrows heavily from the King of action-adventure, Indiana Jones.What begins as a treasure hunt in the City of the Dead soon turns into a plot that essentially goes like this, as described by Rick O\\'Connell (Brendan Fraser), \"Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world.\" The good thing is, there is a lot more to it than that, and unlike Indiana Jones, the male hero is not alone in his mission nor does he get all the credit for it. He is joined by the damsel in distress herself Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) who all want a piece of the treasure in the dead city. While the dialogue is typically sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek, it is not desperately punchy. It is probably on par with the Indiana Jones trilogy in terms of cheesy lines. But Brendan Fraser delivers these in a way that is so fitting that it does not really matter, to be honest. Fraser truly gets to shine and show us that is indeed best when it comes to comedy.This isn\\'t Citizen Kane, but it\\'s NOT \\'brainless\\' summer fun either. It\\'s just a very good adventure story even if it lacks originality. 8/10',\n",
       " 'Citizen Kane it ain\\'t, but if you\\'re looking for good, silly, H. Rider Haggardesque fun, this is the film for you.  While it  hasn\\'t replaced the Universal classic in my affections, let\\'s face it, the venerable original creaks a little.  I mean,  Karloff\\'s Imhotep only moves two feet per hour -- geez, how will I ever escape him?  Arnold Vosloo\\'s Mummy is considerably more fleet, and frankly (from the dirty old lady\\'s perspective) is pretty darned buff for a dead guy.  A modern affectation, sure, but I like the idea of a mummy with a great butt.Brendan Fraser looks good, has a fabulous voice, and a whole boatload of goofy charm.  Hey!  Call me shallow, but that\\'s pretty much all I\\'m looking for in a screen idol.  John Hannah was acceptable, if not inspired, as the wastrel brother.  Rachel Weisz is gorgeous, and acquits herself well in the role of \"Heroine in an Adventure Film;\"  i.e., she screams and gets rescued a lot.OK, I lie.  The modern \"Heroine in an Adventure Film\" is SPUNKY, screams, and gets rescued a lot.And as to Oded Fehr, who plays the mysterious desert guardian of the mummy\\'s tomb (a role traditionally assayed by Welsh character actors) -- I and the rest of the ladies in my party indicated, through a series of incoherent grunts and some unattractive drooling, a strong desire to see much, much more of him.  And we mean that both literally and figuratively.  Powers that be, please take note.A couple of small caveats:  the bug quotient in this film is much higher than I usually tolerate.  It puts you right off your Milk Duds.  And where in the hell did those camels come from?So if you\\'re in a mood for brainless entertainment, I recommend that you set your intellect on stun, rush to the nearest cineplex, buy the large popcorn (WITH butter), and settle in for a couple of hours of colorful, loud, over-the-top fun.Catmommie',\n",

Yes, there is also the requisite damsel-in-distress (and love interest) who captures Imhotep\\'s heart.  The venomous super-villain who must eat the flesh of others in order to survive is a plus as well.  However, director Stephen Sommers (DEEP RISING) transcends beyond cliché material.  He brings to the audience original ideas with a refreshingly cool tone.  He makes sure that there is style within the special effects.  The eye-popping FX in general will keep crowds contented, and then some.It is tough to keep a straight face when watching this movie, but you have to praise Sommers and the cast for letting you have so much fun.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed ridiculous as for some of the sequences.  One scene that had me chuckling throughout was when all the slaves were synchronically chanting \"Imhotep!\"  Kevin J. O\\'Connor finds himself having some of the best one-liners as he may eventually switch allegiances and serve a different master.  Yes, the humor is somewhat gratuitous, granted.  However, in all sincerity, the humor is needed to lighten the film\\'s dark tone.The acting is more second rate.  Arnold Vosloo made a terrific villain and Rachel Weisz lights up the screen with her gorgeous presence.  Fraser and O\\'Connor are great also.  The rest of the cast is kind of listless though. In spite of that, THE MUMMY is a spectacular spectacle laced with show-stopping special effects and genuine chills.  The music, composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith is pulse pounding and excellent.  The orchestration is wonderful during this film\\'s every thread of suspense.Overall, THE MUMMY is one of the best blockbusters of 1999.  Nonstop thrills and surprises galore highlight this enthusiastic, fun-filled entertainment. THE MUMMY has lots of fun and excitement.  The only flaw that prevents this film from being a full fledged four star movie is its occasional lapses in credibility and coherence.  At times, this film is extremely ludicrous, but who cares, its fanatically fun to watch.  Genre fans, take note.Remember, you cannot keep the dead buried forever...RATING: ***1/2 out of ****.',\n",
       " \"It is the mid 22nd Century: over a hundred years before Kirk and Spock. The crew of Earth's latest breakthrough Warp 5 starship; led by Captain Jonathan Archer, are making their first steps into the galaxy. Firmly believing humankind has been held back for too long by Vulcan interference, Archer is eager to embark on Enterprise's mission of deep space exploration. Survival proves perilous the farther from home they travel. Outmatched by superior aliens equipped with far more powerful weaponry, this first crew face a steep learning curve. Among their challenges will come Klingon aggression, militaristic Andorians, territorial Romulans and the Suliban; a race receiving aid from the future. This Temporal Cold War story arc heats up with the arrival of a probe sent by the Xindi and seven million people die in an unprovoked attack. With another more powerful weapon being assembled deep within the Delphic Expanse, Starfleet hastily curtails the Enterprise's assignment, sending their most experienced crew in a desperate attempt to save Earth. Along the way, we discover familiar trek-nology from future Star Trek series at a less advanced stage including a crew scared to use the transporter, so frequent use of space suits, decompression airlocks & shuttle-pods and instead of shields, polarised hull-plating. Those coming straight from JJ Abrams' 2009 movie will probably appreciate this uncomplicated style the most. The rest of us get to have fun spotting familiar elements from past series, especially by the fourth season - as we visit the Mirror Universe, encounter green skinned Orions, as the Vulcans gradually come to respect their illogical allies, as they make the very first steps toward uniting warring races.Out of all the Star Trek series, I generally keep returning to Enterprise for more. I'd like to think that's down to something deeper than knowing the Original Series, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine & Voyager inside and out.I love these characters and while they're definitely not the perfect, moral human beings Gene Roddenberry might have have created, they do in fact hold true to his ideals. They're ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, stumbling and making mis-steps along the way with best of intentions.Archer, interested me from the outset (being familiar with Scott Bakula's previous work) his Captain out there alone with no support, no rulebook or role models to learn from their mistakes. His 'quid pro quo' relationship with Shran (a blue-skinned Andorian), both skeptics of the Vulcan's agenda and yet building bridges that will ultimately lead to an interstellar alliance known as the Federation. Trip, likable Southern Engineer who's deep friendship with his Captain, manages to survive his occasional bouts of insubordination. T'Pol, initially an observer from a Vulcan government concerned about the impact of humankind's deep exploration. Growing more accustomed to the crew and their perspective. Her relationship with Trip, which manages to rise above its somewhat exploitive origins and her struggle to maintain control over her emotions. At this point, I should also make it clear I loved what Enterprise did with the Vulcans and how they are every bit the race seen all the way back to the Original Series. I could continue to outline traits of the various other regulars, who are anything but cyphers in my opinion. Under developed in comparison to the big three for sure, but I feel that was changing... even Travis Mayweather got in on the action by the end.I love the technology - a grappler instead of tractor beams, phase pistols and EM rifles, airlocks and shuttle-pods deployed from bomb bay doors underneath. When you're at a disadvantage, you have nothing but your wits to rely on and this show was about as far from Voyager's technobabble saves the day approach as it was possible for Trek to realistically get.I still believe there is unexplored potential left in Enterprise and indeed it firmly has feet under the franchise table, as a prequel to both the 60's TV show and JJ Abrams' motion picture based in an alternate reality. 2 reasonably good seasons, 2 excellent ones kept me watching and yet still barely scratched the surface. Had I been in charge of CBS/Paramount in 2005, I certainly would not have cancelled this... not considering how well the stories were coming along in leaps and bounds. I hope they're looking at the popularity of Star Trek in cinemas at the moment, and think back to that day fans held a rally outside the studio, sent emails and letters... all protesting the loss of a show that had finally turned the tide into fan acceptance, only to be unjustly rewarded with the axe. Shame on the Executive who made that decision.\",\n",
       " 'Seasons 1 & 2 had some interesting missions, and they explained the origins of certain Star Trek tech like phasers and the transporter -- and the understandable apprehension toward using the transporter. I loved the retro-feel, but the graphics are far from retro - top notch. Also, they explained first contacts with the blue-skinned Andorians, the Klingons, and others. Mostly mission by mission episodes.But in the 3rd season, oh my, this show kicked into high gear with a riveting continuous story-line into the \"expanse\", complete with awesome rendered and practical-effects/make-up beings that some of us heard about from David Wilcock and Corey Goode on Cosmic Disclosure -- reptilians, insectoids, aquatics, and arboreal primate beings, as well as trans-dimensional beings.All-in-all, the spectacular graphics, story lines, galactic dogfights, sexual tension, and humor make this show a gem. I\\'ve always liked Scott Bakula and he makes for a great captain. Linda Park is an absolute doll and Jolene Blalock is the sexiest Vulcan ever. Dr Phlox, played by John Billingsley, is a riot at times and a primary source of unexpected humor -- best Star Trek doc, imo.So much going on in this show. Just starting season 4, and it\\'s looking to be interesting and also seems based on something we heard from Corey Goode. Four seasons is not enough... I hope they pick this up again.',\n",
       " \"I have mixed feelings about this show. It probably has contained some of the best and definitely a lot of the worst Trek episodes ever. It was meant to re-invent Trek but all it did was re-use old plot devices. The best thing they ever did was replace Berman, because he had been working on the franchise too long. Trek needs new blood, and for the 4th season they finally got it. But of course it came too late and now the show has been cancelled after it just started to find its footing.Contrary to some other comments I've seen, Enterprise did NOT use its cast to its fullest potential. Mayweather has been virtually ignored since the first and second seasons (he wasn't even in most of the 3rd season episodes) and when he has been around lately it has only been to lift heavy things or hit something. Reed was just starting to get some good stuff this season. Enterprise had a wonderful opportunity to connect every Trek series together and revitalize the franchise but all it did (and most people believe this) was bury it. Despite Enterprise's accomplishments, its failures reign supreme. As much as I love Trek, it needs a rest. Maybe after a few years it will be brought back by people who have new ideas to bring to it. Then, hopefully, we will truly go where no one has gone before.\",\n",
       " 'I read a little about the history of Star Trek and wonder every time about the strange relation between cult status and commercial success. TOS was not a commercial hit back when it was aired. However, after decades, it reached that cult-status that led Hollywood to produce the movie series first, and TNG later. It would be nice to see a pattern, a cycle (or anti-cycle if you wish), in such Trek developments (not to forget about Voyager and DS9 of course) and maybe there is one: at the apex of amount of series, commercial flop once again seemed to have hit Trek universe. Oddly, I still encounter numerous fans of TNG and VOY today (less DS9 ones, but I always thought that one was not so bad at all).I was not that much Trek fan at all to understand that a new, prequel series was on its way back in 2000/2001. My first \"contact\" with Archer and the crew of NX-01 was somewhere in 2003 or 2004, when a friend of mine was watching an episode on his laptop during some lab exercise at university. I saw Scott Bakula and my prejudice was there, pronto: \"What? Quantum Leap is the captain of an Enterprise? Forget!\". Now I don\\'t have the slightest antipathy to Mr Bakula: I think he was great in Quantum Leap and I always tried to catch the show on TV. But to see him being captain on that ship, where I already had seen Kirk and Picard (I learned to appreciate Picard only a few years ago), two men of so different, but so shaped character, made my opinion be clear: no way this was going to work. And then: a prequel! Please, no more, after I saw what Lucas did to his fantastic space opera! Why was Hollywood always trying to follow tendencies... even if they were proved to be flops from a content point of view? I decided to skip this Trek travel and turned my interest elsewhere. After some more years I learned that ENT was dead just after four seasons, because of commercial flop. I took notice and I thought I was right from the beginning.Last New Year\\'s Eve, the Italian channel LA7 aired a \"special Trek night\", showing an episode from TOS, the movie \"Generations\" and finally the pilot (episode one and two) from ENT. I knew the first two that good, that I skipped them from time to time (helping with dinner preparations), but I watched the pilot in full. It was not enough to make me crazy about, but I was getting curious. I recalled from 2003/2004, that I found the blue outfit ridiculous in a way. And I couldn\\'t understand why they had used a song theme instead of the classic, instrumental Trek theme, of course adapted in some way. So I got the DVDs and started watching...I am almost at the end of ENT\\'s season one and I wish I to put in words precisely what determined my change of mind. Let\\'s start right from the beginning: the title score. Simply magnificent. I particularly like the scene where Alan Shepard is smiling ironically at the camera (I would like to know when that one was taken) and it stands, for me, as a symbol for all that sacrifices made by countless women and men since generations in air- and spacecraft: very often paying with their own lives. Then, Robert Goddad, as he is writing some formula on a blackboard. Chuck Yaeger and Amelia Earhart. The complete short title sequence perfectly grasps the endeavors made by mankind to unfold the unknown. As to the series: I found the pilot\\'s plot not particularly overwhelming, but the subsequent episodes are intriguing. Besides the episode character of the series, I now like the prequel character and can\\'t get enough to learn how they dealt with first beam transportation, phasers and the necessity of having some sort of \"protocol\" when leaving the ship, encountering new races etc. This is real dedication to details from the writers/producers! The ship is also more fragile than any other Enterprise we saw, it does not have the defense mechanisms we have on TNG. And then we have the not so easy relationship with the Vulcans and I must admit Mr Bakula does a masterpiece of interpretation when he plays the bullheaded captain, who slowly but constantly transforms into a responsible and open minded captain. Jolene Blalock is the most stunning female Vulcan I have ever seen. Her presence adds a certain eroticism and mystery to the show I have never experienced before in any other Trek show. Sure, there may be some continuity errors, some more evident than others. But we\\'re all human after all, and I am not measuring ENT against TNG and TOS: I just want new stories from the Enterprise and her crew!As you probably already have understood, today I ask myself why this show has been canceled after just four seasons (if I recall well, TOS was also canceled after four seasons or so). Again, commercial success is the measure of everything. But now, if take myself as unit of measurement and ask myself why did I contribute to let this fail, I feel that there are many, complex reasons. But, evidently, I needed time to appreciate. Time to pull my prejudices down. Time, to remember the \"Trek that was\" (I watched the movies again and the entire TNG seasons in the meantime) and that is gone for good. Today, if there was a petition to bring ENT back, I would sign it immediately.Since time is my so recurrent reason for ENT being \"my\" flop, when it was aired, I wonder if Hollywood should not apply more flexible time spans when it measures commercial success. To the cast and crew of ENT, I wish you to come back either as series or as movie.10/10',\n",
       " \"Enterprise became my favorite show as soon as I saw it, the opening song, the characters, the design... All ran through my mind every day after viewing it. Enterprise is at its core a show about exploration, about breaking the boundaries that other people have put on you. Its also about discovery, which as its turns out isn't always a good thing. The characters Don't start out set in stone, and then have problems thrown at them, the change over the course of the show, and the writers were not afraid to shake their lives up; sometimes is horrific ways.We get to see Earth meet new alien cultures, go through its first interstellar war, and see it develop. The show doesn't pull its punches either, when things die they are dead, characters can be irrational, immoral, and generally very realistic.Enterprise succeeds where much TV fails, it created a cast of interesting, developing characters while still delivering the action that makes TV fun. But without people, action is Empty. Enterprise is perfect in my eyes at least, and deserves to be seen. Even if you don't normally like Sci-fi, you might enjoy this show. A lot.\",\n",
       " 'When movies are created, they are done so with intent. Different genres of film target specific audiences, a formula which has sustained Hollywood and it\\'s industries since the beginning of the blockbuster movies. When a movie is created in a manner that sets in motion any given goal, said films success is pendant on whether or not that goal is reached. If a comedy creates laughter, or if a romance produces tears, then they are successes in their own right. So when a massively ambitious, seemingly impossible to create film aiming to usher in a new era manages to grab hold of it\\'s audience and take them on an unprecedented cinematic roller coaster ride that delivers the goods every turn of the way, it can be considered successful. Avatar is that success.A work in progress that spanned a decade and a half, Avatar is more than just a film - it\\'s an experience, an event. When James Cameron set out to make this movie back in the mid 90\\'s, he realized that his ambitions were simply too far ahead of their time. His ideas could not be reached in a feasible manner, and due to this, he had to wait. Or create. Once informed that the image he held for this film was one that was out of grasp, he began working on the technology that would bring his masterpiece within reach. Fifteen years and nearly half a billion dollars later, James Cameron has brought that vision to the screen, and has done so in an extravagant and showstopping way.Avatar tells the tale of a war between species, each fighting for the ultimate survival of their race. Desperate to find the fuel for their dying planet, human soldiers and scientists set out from earth and set course for Pandora. A planet connected by all living things, Pandora is home to an indigenous species known as the Na\\'vi, as well as the precious element Unobtanium needed to save earth. Using transference technology, paralyzed marine Jake Sully is volunteered for the \"Avatar Program\", which enables the thoughts and mind of a human to be placed within the shell of a tube-born Na\\'vi body. Using this as technique to their advantage, Jake is sent into the harsh Jungles of Pandora in order to bond with the natives, thus gaining knowledge and insight on their ways. Having originally planned to use this knowledge as a means of negotiating the natives relocation, so that the humans can access the deposit of Unobtainium - which just happens to sit below their most worshiped and valued pseudo-deity of their planet.While the plot on paper may read as a standard shoot\\'em-up action sci-fi flick, it is a near inconceivable task to truly explain how incorrect this appearance truly is. This takes a stroke from every movie, and a dab from every genre, and manages to create a portrait of beauty, in which all pre-existing notion of what cinema can and cannot do is destroyed. Within the lengthy hundred and sixty some odd minutes of film, moviegoers will find that there is always something to keep them enthralled, a merciful gift when considering how tedious many of the longer film of recent memory can become.No matter what can be said about the overtly cheesy script,a criticism that, while holding true, manages to fit charmingly into the over-the-top nature of the film, Avatar does as it set out to do, bringing moviegoers a cinematic experience rather than a film. Relying on the technology that he created, Cameron pours his heart into this movie, and it shows in every scene. Ranging from the absurdly detailed creatures to all-too-realistic planet, this flick manages to tell a fulfilling story while all the while throwing jaw-dropping scenery at the audience, giving them only enough time to recover before bombarding them with yet another breathtaking shot.Be it the fantastical and charming love story told between the native and the outsider, or the too-real-to-be-true action scenes between gunships and foreign ferals, Avatar is what Star Wars was too the 70\\'s, the Wizard Of Oz of the 40\\'s - a masterpiece that will go down in movie history as a game changer of it\\'s time.4 Stars out of 4 Stars',\n",
       " \"A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10\",\n",

       " '\"Avatar\" is not the next \"Star Wars\" or \"Lord of the Rings.\" It might be the next \"Matrix,\" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next \"Matrix Revolutions.\" It\\'s technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after \"Return of the King.\" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they\\'re all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film\\'s story.It\\'s the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the \"Na\\'vi,\" aren\\'t too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na\\'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na\\'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he\\'s paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don\\'t feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what\\'ll happen. You\\'ve seen \"Dances with Wolves\" and \"The Last Samurai.\" Heck, even \"Dead Man.\" The Na\\'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, \"we have to fight terror with terror.\" The Na\\'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It\\'s all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it\\'s entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson\\'s King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It\\'s worth seeing for that reason, but I don\\'t think it\\'ll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about \"Star Wars\" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don\\'t think anyone will remember \"Jake Sully.\" 6/10',\n",
       " \"Caution: spoilers may abound. I think this movie is severely underrated. Most complaints I see are of people who can't let go of the vision of superman they got from Christopher reeve who played a superman who was a god among men who never made mistakes and always knew what to do. That's not someone we relate to in this day and age because in our cynical and jaded society it's impossible to be that morally upright. I like Henry Cavill's superman because he plays a man who has to learn how to be superman. He's not perfect out the gate and he doesn't automatically know how to handle every situation right out the gate. Because of this a lot of lives are lost in the battle of metropolis and superman is forced to end zod because there is no other recourse because there is no way to contain him on earth with all the kryptonian tech is destroyed. Whatever you can say about how believable it is that superman didn't have a choice it's still set up well. Krypton was very beautiful and Russell Crowe made a great jor el. As far as the plot for the movie I understand the criticism that the flashbacks don't make sense but I think the death of Jonathan Kent is done very well because it's a sacrifice intended to keep Clark undercover. All in all its not perfect but it's far from terrible.\",\n",
       " \"Don't judge this movie. Don't listen to what others have to say about it(positive or negative) don't compare this with other superman or superhero films. Watch this movie without the bias and without reading the reviews, as I did along with 200 other students in my boarding school's auditorium. We were mesmerized would be an understatement. The movie is not perfect. There are and will be in the future better movies in man of steel. There are some glaring flaws in this movie most prominent being the destruction and loss of civilian lives. I enjoyed the destruction but it doesn't mean it was justified (superman kissing in the midst didn't help). As there are flaws there are also moments which define the movie and man these moments, lets talk about them. The SOUNDTRACK is probably the best we've seen on any movie this century . I was 15 when I saw this and believe it or not the music helped me cope up my fear of competitive swimming. When swimming there is this moment, right before you dive off you feel numb, butterflies running through the stomach and there is nothing in the world you want more than to go back. The theme helped me cope up with that dreaded feeling as whenever i felt that, I would be reminded of the film's music and all of it would disappear.I won medals due to the positive energy of hope the soundtrack(during certain scenes like the first flight ) conveys. Hans Zimmer is a legend. The back story of Clark. The way he saves that bus from falling or his father consoling him just adds a realistic depth to a character as unrealistic as superman. This goes beyond the storytelling to normalize the myth of the spaceboy and succeeds. By the time the backstory is completed( in a non-linear way) Clark Kent is more human than most characters portrayed on-screen ever will be. The tone. another stand out feature of the movie is the somber tone it has. Every character is given time to develop and the character development is never rushed. The prep talk. When Clark takes the road of discovery he meets with the memories of his real father. He explains to Clark his place in the world he gives him a life lesson relevant in the real world. All these things and considering the middling reviews this movie got, makes this an underrated movie. I hope the future would be kind to this movie and see that, despite its flaws what a movie Snyder made. Special props to Zimmer as there might not be a better background score for a superhero movie, period.\",\n",
       " 'I know that there are a lot of haters when it comes to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, it has it\\'s flaws and is by no means the strongest movie of the Indiana Jones series, but I just have so many good memories about this film and still to this day when I watch it, it gives me chills and excitement. The characters are memorable, the script is great, and Indiana is still pulling in the action packed excitement continuing from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The direction, editing, even the special effects are great. You have to love Short Round and Willy, the two new side kicks to Indiana\\'s new adventure. Now I agree, Willy can get a little annoying here and there, but she was just so hilarious in that scene with the bugs and having to save Indiana and Short Round. Plus, Short Round has some of the most memorable lines of the entire series \"Okey, dokey, Dr. Jones, hold on to your potato!\", cheesy, but so funny. Harrison Ford still has Indiana down to a tee, this was the role that was meant for him.In this prequel, we start off in China on a trade off gone wrong with Lao Che, he ends up meeting a beautiful and very high maintence American girl, Willie. They escape together with Indiana\\'s little side kick, Short Round and accidentally without knowing, they\\'ve escaped onto Lao Che\\'s air plane. They wind up in India, where they find out about these rocks that can restore the village they\\'re in, also the children have been kidnapped by Mola Ram and Indiana must free the kids and restore the rocks so the village can be safe again.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fun sequel, I don\\'t know why people complain so much about it.

       " \"Everyone complains about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. One of my friends and I used to argue for months on end about which Indian Jones film was the superior. Almost anyone we ask say that Temple of Doom is their least favorite, and the worst in the Jones trilogy. I believe the only reason people say this, is because it's the middle film, sandwiched between an all time classic, and a Hollywood blockbuster. To me, there is NO question that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the far superior Indiana Jones film. To anyone who says Last Crusade is the best I can do nothing but disagree (let me point out that all THREE films are nothing short of phenomenal). Temple of Doom had so much to live up to after the first film, and instead of trying to re-create Raiders (something I feel Crusade did), Lucas and Spielberg decided to take the franchise in a new direction. In my opinion, this was a great idea. Crusade and Raiders are too similar: both of them take place in desert terrain, both have Indy going after a very famous, biblical artifact, and both have Indy fighting off the Nazi's from attaining this object for global domination. Without Temple of Doom, Last Crusade would be an obvious copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark. A different style of Indy film is needed to expand the trilogy, making Indiana Jones a truly global character, and Temple of Doom did just that.The film itself is a non-stop action, adventure ride. Harrison Ford is once again AMAZING as the dashing professor/archaeologist thrill seeker. Short Round is a loveable character who adds a humorous touch, and reveals the more compassionate side of Indy's character. The ceremony scenes are truly breathtaking and tense. During these scenes the film contains some very graphic images, but are used justifiably to convey the real dark, feel of this film (i.e. the removing of the man's heart while he's still alive, and lowering him into a fiery pit). The mine cart chase scenes are the most amazing, fast moving action sequence in any of the Indy films, and you feel like you're on a roller coaster each time you watch it. All these events lead to the film's spectacular and memorable climax.I know with three films as amazing as the Indiana Jones trilogy, it's hard to pick a best and worst film, in fact it's nearly impossible. I'm just going to say that each film is great on it's own, and really shouldn't be compared to the other two.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s funny to call \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" a followup to \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". This film is a prequel to the 1981 smash hit, a movie where the events that take place actually took place before the events in \"Raiders\". Notice at the beginning of \"Raiders\" that the year is 1936. In \"Temple of Doom\", the year is 1935. See what I mean? \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" is another rollercoaster ride of a movie brought to life by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Harrison Ford is back as archaeologist Indiana Jones who this time searches for a sacred stone that was stolen from an Indian village. Along for the ride is American singer/entertainer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, aka Mrs. Steven Spielberg) and little Chinese sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). On their way to finding the stone they stumble across a palace that leads to the gateway of the Temple of Doom run by an evil Thugee cult. The action and special effects are first-rate as you would expect, though the story is a tad weaker than it was in \"Raiders\". Plus, Capshaw\\'s performance leaves something to be desired. She goes so far over-the-top in some scenes that you\\'d wish Karen Allen would show up as Marion. Nevertheless, Capshaw isn\\'t all that bad. She does make an impression during the times when she\\'s not screaming. But Ke Huy Quan (now known as Jonathan Ke Quan) comes off better as Indy\\'s young sidekick. The following year he starred in the Spielberg produced Richard Donner directed \"The Goonies\", but then didn\\'t appear in much after that. \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" is great fun only if you can get by Kate Capshaw\\'s simpering wimpering character or the over-the-top violence. I found it to be exciting from beginning to end.***1/2 (out of four)POINT OF INTEREST: this was the film that lead to the creation of the PG-13 rating in 1984 (along with Spielberg\\'s other 1984 movie \"Gremlins\"). Both \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and \"Gremlins\" feature violence that most people felt was too strong for a PG rating, though the MPAA felt that it wasn\\'t strong enough to merit an R rating (other Spielberg movies that got PG ratings that were quite intense were \"Jaws\", \"Poltergeist\", and the original \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"). So after \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and \"Gremlins\" opened in theaters at the beginning of the summer movie season of 1984 and became two of that year\\'s biggest hits, the MPAA realized a new rating had to be created. The PG-13 rating was born. In August 1984, the first movies were released with the new PG-13 rating (\"Red Dawn\" and \"The Woman in Red\"). It\\'s not a new rating anymore. The PG-13 rating has held up very well these last 18 years and it\\'ll still go strong in the years to come. But I\\'ll always remember \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" as the leading factor to the creation of the PG-13 rating.',\n",
       " \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the second of the Indy films from director Steven Spielberg, though chronologically it is actually the first. This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn't quite there. It's an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.The film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.Ford is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.\",\n",
       " \"(re-Review): I've never disliked this movie, but it's also been a hard movie to love over time. I also never watched it as much as I can remember Raiders, or even Last Crusade (the latter I feel like was more of a TV thing, like on the USA network). I think the two main things that bog this down are a) I don't really care all that much about the quest for the stones - as far as MacGuffins go, these are some flimsy MacGuffins, which I almost forgot about midway through the movie, and b) Willie Scott is just a terribly written character.Kate Capshaw, it should be said, isn't exactly BAD, per-say, but her character is so one-dimensional that she's not really given all that much interesting stuff to do except be the uber/quintessential Damsel-in-Distress, to the point (perhaps it was the idea?) of parody, or as some kind of ditzy sexual object. Her best scene is when she is going back and forth across the room, inter-cut with Jones talking to himself, about whether or not to leave the room or wait for the other to come to have 'mating rituals'. Oh, she CAN be annoying in her screaming and perpetual HELP ME-ness, and yet it's interesting that some people - not all, but some - are more annoyed by Short Round.To put it into Star Wars terms, imagine, easily enough, that Jones is Han Solo (and of course, both are Ford). Short Round is basically one of the droids, doing whatever to help the hero in his quest. Willie, on the other hand, is no Leia, or even a goddamn Padme. It's a flatly written one-dimensional object to follow along Dr. Jones on this mission that, in the grand scheme of things with this series, is a bit superfluous.Some backstory on the production can sometimes help; it was a dark time for Lucas as he was going through a divorce, and he poured I imagine a lot of that darkness into the depiction of these tribespeople doing their insane rituals involving torn-hearts and fires burned and so on underground. Certainly those moments where Jones is in 'evil' mode are scary - though how he just snaps out of it due to fire is just one of those 'things' you really have to suspend-to-disbelieve here. And on Spielberg's part, he's always there to work and make some craftsman-stuff, but his heart is really in a couple of the set- pieces, like the descending spikes from the ceiling in the trapped room, and of course the cart-chase.That cart-chase is a piece of icon action cinema, and for good reason; it makes the movie into a literal interpretation of what it's trying to be, as a ROLLER COASTER ride. And like roller- coasters, they're fun, they're diverting, they may be scary, and once they're over you... don't get much substance from them. So Spielberg is there to work but not fully with his heart in it (one wonders what he thought of the script on first read, from future Howard the Duck scribes Hyuck and Katz), and Lucas in a mood that is bizarre and tonally strange. What to make of a movie that has such very dark turns, and the ends with the goofiest set piece of Jones chopping a bridge so that the nameless Indians fall to their deaths as hords of crocodiles are just there already waiting.In other words, this is the most outlandish, CARTOONISH of the bunch. I'd almost like this more if it was an animated movie; ironically years later Spielberg would make The Adventures of Tintin, a kind of Indiana Jones with a kid as the hero, and that somehow is LESS cartoony than this movie with its scenes where everything is over the top. Again, it makes for a good ride, and Ford is always great as Indiana Jones - yes, even in Crystal Skull, which I don't think is as bad as has been made out to be - but it's memorable only for the ride aspect, not for its particular, shall we say, pathos.\",\n",
       " \"For a long time, this was the only one of the three Indiana Jones films I did not like. Then, when it was part of the DVD package that came out over five years ago, I had to buy it if I wanted the other two, so I gave it a third look. Wow, all of sudden I liked it. For the first time, the woman (Kate Capshaw) and the young boy (Ke Huy Quan) weren't as annoying as I had remembered them. The stupid kid really had rubbed me the wrong way, but this time only Kate was annoying....and she was fine once she calmed down and got rid of the hysterics.The action in this film is mostly at the beginning and at the end. It is so Rambo-ish (bad guys never hit the target but good guys always do) it is ludicrous. It also has dumb dialog in a number of spots, paying homage to voodooism, spells and other nonsense.Yet, despite these criticisms, it's entertaining start-to-finish and has some fantastic visuals. The photography in here is beautiful: the best of the three Jones adventures. I particularly liked the opening dance number which reminded me of a Busby Berkeley extravaganza. This whole film looks spectacular on DVD.\",\n",
       " 'This is a shockingly bad movie. I can\\'t for the life of me understand why it has earned over a 7.0 rating on IMDb and a club of supporters on the Internet. Nostalgia, perhaps? I enjoy \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" even though I find it to be a little politically incorrect and overrated. \"The Temple of Doom,\" on the other hand, is downright atrocious, mightily racist and even a tad sexist. Apparently the movie was banned in India, and I can understand why, since it depicts Indians as miserably poor, superstitious, knife-waving, monkey-brain-eating lunatics.The really sad part is that the movie stinks even if you manage to ignore the racism. It\\'s chock full of disgusting moments, like the beetle-eating scene and the part where about a hundred bugs crawl all over Kate Capshaw. It simply pushes the gross envelope too far.Even the never-ending action scenes are lacking. They\\'re okay, I guess, but there\\'s quite a lot of unconvincing blue screen work, and the big flood segment doesn\\'t work because water doesn\\'t \"miniaturize\" well. As if the special effects weren\\'t bad enough in themselves, they\\'re complimented by an obnoxious soundtrack, including some unusually bombastic John Williams music and Capshaw\\'s relentless screaming.You know, she really is a terrible heroine - annoying and painfully unfunny. A beautiful woman, sure, but irksome as all get-out. It\\'s very surprising (in a bad way) to see such a lame female character in Indiana Jones after the series started off with Karen Allen\\'s excellent performance as the (relatively) tough Marion Ravenwood.Capshaw would be quite bad enough by herself, but compounding the casting problem there\\'s Ke Huy Quan as Short Round, Indy\\'s pointless kid sidekick. Whenever there\\'s a stupid bit of slapstick comedy in the movie, Short Round helpfully cries, \"Very funny! Very funny!\" Which is code for painfully unfunny, of course.Weirdly enough, Capshaw (whose character is called Willie, for goodness\\' sake!) and Short Round are really the only characters - the villains are completely faceless. There\\'s a very bizarre segment when Indy puts on his scholarly glasses and has dinner with some people who I guess might qualify as characters, but the scene just doesn\\'t fit with the rest of the movie, and never for a moment does the dialogue feel \"real.\" So, in the absence of strong characters, the movie just sort of drunkenly reels from fight to fight.I have one last observation. At one moment, Indy is waiting in his bedroom, expecting Capshaw to come in and have sex with him (he\\'s too proud to go to her bedroom). The strange part about this set-up is that Short Round is in Indy\\'s bedroom. Soooo...I guess Indy is expecting to have sex in front of Short Round? Isn\\'t that a little strange? Well, maybe not; I guess the kid has to learn sometime. But maybe Indy should just go to her room, huh? Sloppy scenes like that are a sure indication that Spielburg, Lucas and co. were really having an off day when they made this. Terrible, terrible, terrible.',\n",
       " \"An underrated gem of the 80's, An adventure not to be missed and indescribably classic in every sense of the word. I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones franchise and unlike most fans, consider Temple of Doom to be my favourite of the series and one of my favourite films.Set one year before Raiders(In 1935), Temple of Doom's plot doesn't revolve around the Nazis and takes a darker root. This time Indiana teams up with a club singer named Willie and ten year old, Asian boy named Short Round. After a treasure deal goes wrong the three escape in a plane which turns out to be a trap, causing them to do a death defying escape which ends up in India. When the village people their warn them of the mysterious temple and the horrible loss of their children, the three set off to discover the temple. The plot just gets darker and more action packed from there.Harrison Ford returns in his signature role as Indina Jones and is still the tough as nails archaeologist he was in Raiders. Short Round is a lovable and has great chemistry with Indy, and during the film he becomes one of the most memorable sidekicks ever. Willie, is a typical damsel in distress, who spends the movie screaming and moaning, but this is just a throwback to the 'B' movies, the Indiana Jones films are inspired by.From start to finish the film is filled with tons of memorable moments, classic set-pieces and amazing stunt and camera work. With a snow ball pacing that gradually gets bigger and better as it goes along, the movie is pretty much impossible not to enjoy. The score is one of the best I've heard in a film a mixed with the creative and memorable camera work, just makes the film even better and gives me chills every time.I can't stress this enough, but Temple of Doom is a must see for any fan of film. Some say it's too dark (Heart Scene)and the sillier moments ruined it(Dinner Scene), but the experience for me was never spoilt and the dark moments just made it better. With a bigger 'B' movie feel, great action, amazing set-pieces and effects and timeless feel the film gets my highest recommendation. Not to be missed!\",\n",
       " 'Indiana Jones is one the most unique film characters ever created.  He is not a superhero, he is not incredibly well built and he does not exhibit Einstein like smarts.However, he does have is the most relentless desire to succeed and never give up.  He started that in Raiders of the Lost Ark and he continues it in Temple of Doom.  I once saw an interview with Steven Spielberg years after Temple was released.  He was being asked about Temple of Doom and he said that when him and George Lucas looked at the screenplay for Temple of Doom Steven turned to George and asked him if they could do all that was written.  George turned back to him and said \" I have no idea. \"  But they started filming and when it came to doing what seemed to be the impossible, they somehow managed to do it.  Because that is what you get when you put two of the greatest minds in the business today together, success.  Reality says that there are limitations to what can be done.  Steven and George take that reality and laugh at it.  Maybe now a days, some 16 years later, things like the mine care chase and the pit of fire seem like simple things to film but remember this is 1984.  Special effects were not as advanced as they are now and to create some of what they did is realy quite incredible.  I don\\'t know how long it must have taken to film the mine cart scene but think of difficult and arduos a process that would be.  Spielberg will always be the king of motion pictures in my book and films like this helped solidify that title.  The man is a genius, he really is.  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fantastic film and it furthers his character.  The film isn\\'t just a rehash of the first, it actually expands on the story.  And to make it even more fun, it takes place before the events in Raiders do.One of the most entertaining parts of Temple of Doom is Indy\\'s new sidekick named Short Round, Shorty for short.  Ke Huy Quan plays shorty with so much energy and he becomes an integral part of the film.  He has a few good one liners and his physical acting skills are a perfect match for Harrison Fords.  The film starts off much in the same way that Raiders does, with something that really has little to do with the rest of the film.  It is here that we are introduced to Indy once again, Willie Scott, the beautiful nightclub singer, Short Round and even to one of Indy\\'s old friends named Mohan, who loses his life abruptly.  The reason I mention Mohan is because Marion had a friend named Mohan at her bar in Nepal.  I wonder if these two guys were related somehow.After the energy at the beginning of the film it slows down to explain the story and set it up for us.  But from the moment Indy and Short Round go into the secret wall in their room, the film never slows down.  It is from here that we witness all the things that we now expect from an Indiana Jones movie:  boobie traps, evil bad guys, bugs, perilous turns at every corner and of course the bullwhip.  Some of the funniest parts in the film are also when Indy and Shorty are stuck in the cavern with the ceiling slowly caving in on them.  Willie can hear their screams of help and she has to come and rescue them.  She gingerly and slowly walks down the cave and gets to them. As she puts her hand into the hole in the wall to release them, Indy sticks his hand out and says \"the other right, the other right, your other right. \" and then just before they are about to be crushed he looks at her and with a child like face he says \" Willie, we are going to die! \"  It is such a funny moment that if you haven\\'t seen Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom then you should just for this one part.  Temple of Doom is so full of energy and action that it is definitely a film ahead of its time.  People complained that the film was too violent and that it wasn\\'t suitable for kids so they actually changed the rating system in the U.S for this movie.  PG-13 was born just for Temple of Doom. Interesting piece of trivia there for you.As for the movie itself, Indiana Jones becomes somewhat of a deity to some villagers outside of Shanghai.  They have lost their three stones that supposedly bring good luck to the village.  They also have their children kidnapped by the Thugees, led by a nasty villain named Mola Rom.  He is a human sacrificing menacing man that pulls people\\'s hearts out of their chest just before he lowers them into a hellacious pit of fire as a human sacrifice to Sheeba.  Indy is then captured and put under a spell by having to drink some blood.  It is here that the movie gets it\\'s PG-13 rating when not only Indy but Short Round are whipped with the cat-o-nine tails.  It is quite disturbing and I guess if kids were going to watch the film it would be a bit much for them.  Temple of Doom is a great film and it is a great sequel to Raiders and a perfect prequel to Last Crusade.  It remembers its roots as it has Indy reaching for his gun in a dangerous situation only to find that it is not there and it creates some of its own new history as there are many breath taking action sequences.  I don\\'t know how George and Steven do it but they just keep on entertaining us with movies like this and Star Wars.  I sincerely hope they make a fourth installment of the Indiana Jones series. It has been ten years since the last one and that is way too long.',\n",

       " \"It's rare for a big movie studio to trust the future of a potential blockbuster franchise to a brand-new director. You'd imagine that there would be just too much at stake when it came to translating James Dashner's series of best-selling dystopian novels to the silver screen. But it's easy to see why Wes Ball got the job - with this one film, he graduates from short films to blockbuster movies with flair to spare. Indeed, The Maze Runner is such a cool, confident and thrilling blend of action beats and character work that it's hard to believe Ball has never before commandeered a full- length feature film. It's true that the narrative gets a little away from him by the end, making less sense as more secrets are revealed. But this is more a problem with the source material than Ball's own skills as a director.Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) finds himself thrust rudely into the world of the Glade: a community of boys who have figured out how to live while encircled by a giant, constantly changing maze, within which dwell giant, boy-eating monsters known only as Grievers. Many of the boys, including benevolent pioneer Alby (Aml Ameen) and champion of the old ways Gally (Will Poulter), are content with just surviving day to day. Thomas winds up unsettling the entire camp with his refusal to follow the rules and determination to ask questions: he wants to explore the Maze with designated runners like Minho (Ki Hong Lee), and figure out a way to get free. Life in the camp gets more complicated when, weeks before the next boy is due to be sent up to the Glade, a girl in the form of Theresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives instead.There's a lot of blockbuster potential to be squeezed out of this premise, and Ball does so quite wonderfully. The Maze encircling the Glade is a stonily grey, massive enclosure, and the Grievers - when the boys encounter them in increasingly close quarters - are odd marvels made as much of machine as flesh. Ball cuts scenes of great, heart-stopping tension together masterfully: whether it's Thomas running through walls that are fast closing in on him, or Thomas and Minho trying to outrun a Griever while burdened with an unconscious Alby.The film even finds some welcome dramatic depth in this strange little community of lost boys in the Glade - Thomas' growing antagonism with Gally is balanced against the mutual respect he and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) develop for each other, and the brotherly connection that he forges with the adorable Chuck (Blake Cooper). The politics of the situation is fascinating as well: as much as The Maze Runner is about, well, running for your life in a giant maze, it also raises big questions about identity and integrity. Is safety and security worth giving up your right to information and choice?What works less well is the secret around which the Glade is constructed. As viewers, we aren't given a whole lot of answers about why the Glade and the Maze exists, nor do we get many explanations as to why Thomas is so different and insatiably curious. But the ones we do get - all centred around the mysterious, severe figure of Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) in some kind of control centre - oddly render the film and its characters less, rather than more, interesting. It's a strangely deflating experience to have the film's rich ethical dilemmas and intense action sequences give way to an underlying dystopian narrative that isn't really all that compelling.Nevertheless, The Maze Runner remains quite an accomplishment. It's an assured, impressive debut for Ball, one with enough electric tension and moody drama to intrigue throughout its running time. His young cast is fully capable of carrying their own weight, with Poulter - morphing from comic sidekick in We're The Millers into hateful adversary here - the standout. Its story collapses a little into itself as it hurtles towards its climax, but Ball's work is quite enough to leave viewers excited by the prospect of the inevitable sequel.\",\n",

       " \"The film The Maze Runner is based off the three book series written by author James Dashner.As post-apocalyptic films adapted from YA novels go, and there have been many, The Maze Runner might be the most successful of the 2014 year.The film opens on a young teen, seemingly kidnapped against his will and unclear of what he is doing. His body, limp on the floor of a openly woven caged box, rises up to the sun and grass where he promptly meets a crowd of his peers, all male. Talking with them he discovers he is exactly like them, unknowingly in this location, his memory erased with only his name available to him, it is Thomas.He soon discovers the grassy area's perimeter is completely encapsulated by steeply high concrete walls, beyond which is a maze. The goal is to figure out the maze as it is the only way to freedom.The Maze Runner uses young up-and-comer actors and actresses rather than the obvious and nepotistic decision. Dylan O'Brien does a superb job as the newbie Thomas and Aml Ameen is especially captivating as the leader of the stranded survivors Alby. The primarily British young actors also do a splendid job of masking their native accents for a neutrally American vocal pattern.Further, Wes Ball's direction of The Maze Runner has a clear vision as it emulates a vastly PG-er Lord of the Flies vibe. The beauty of the film is its simplicity. Since the children and teens are locked in an experimental cage, there is no need for monotonous information delivery regarding the futuristic world. There's no futuristic dialect, class system, government changes or anything of the type.\",\n",
       " \"For a film that is budgeted at merely 34 million dollars, this film visually looks really good. For comparison, Fantastic Four had a budget of 120 million and the effects and so called 'set pieces' were awful. This is one of the biggest problems with Hollywood, but that's a discussion for another day. The Maze Runner is actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. For an age in which the medium is flooded with young adult novels and movies, the film feels fresh and isn't overwhelmed by clichés like so many others are.It's led by a relatively unknown cast. Dylan O'Brien, from Teen Wolf fame, is thrown into a maze structure along with a few dozen other young men who soon find there is more to the maze than they were led to believe. Let me be the first to say I think O'Brien has some chops and definitely has a future in this business. The role doesn't require a ton of range, but I think he proved he can lead a huge action film, and not many actors can say that. The writing itself I thought could have been a little smarter and more mature. Will Poulter, who played a much different character in We're The Millers, was solid in the role that was given to him. But the writing had him doing some really stupid things and was full of forced dialogue I felt.With that being said, the mythology behind the story is pretty interesting. And they made the film into a more traditional monster film than I'm sure the book originally called for, but it really works. The horror element to the film was by far the most intriguing, and had the biggest payoff. The 'Greavers' also proved to be pretty terrifying, something I didn't think I would say about a film with a bunch of teenagers. So I really only watched this because I'm probably going to see the sequel this weekend, and i ended up enjoying the movie. Plus, having Littlefinger as the next villain gets me pretty excited.+Monster flick+Surprisingly well acted+Suspensful-Some stupid dialogue7.2/10\",\n",

Much like an episode of Lost meeting The Lord of the Flies meeting  Labyrinth, we understand narrative at the same time as Thomas, who is  eventually told that three years ago a young teenage boy first arrived  at the glade, and each month since one more arrives in the lift with  certain supplies to survive. Unknowing of why and unable to escape they  have become helplessly trapped there since. Similarly to The Lord of  the Flies, the group of boys, all probably aged 10-20 have creating a  living-area, created rules, swearwords and the imperative code to  'never go beyond those walls' - but as Thomas arrives at the glade all  seems to change for the worse, and many of the other 'Gladers' take  note.  Admittedly we had not read the book until after we had saw the film,  but from the very first paragraph we noted its book-to-screen accuracy.  Fans of the book will be more than satisfied with the minimal changes,  and any made are for the better.  The film, upheld by a ninety-nine percent teen cast, feels news and  many of the actors are in roles unseen before. Dylan O'Brien, From TV's  Teen-Wolf, provides an exceptional lead role as Thomas and carries the  film in both story and emotional trawls. Although new to the setting  and with the films entirety taking place over just a few days, he  comfortably fits in, although ruffling many traditions too. At one  point it is said 'I don't know if he is brave or stupid, but we need  more of him'.  Co-staring alongside Dylan O'Brien are equally exceptional performances  by; Will Poulter, in a dark tough-guy role, (and absolutely nothing  like his recent role as Kenny in We're The Millar's); Thomas  Brodie-Sangster stars as a fellow Glader; and Kaya Scodelario in a  surprise turn-up as the first female at the Glade - but also 'the last  one ever' to arrive. Although the narrative between them is conflicting  at times, the chemistry is smooth as if friends both on-and-off the  screen. Notably, we can confirm that the characters live-up the book  creations and are almost perfectly cast.  Evidentially former director/writer/editor/effects maestro, Wes Ball  uses skills from his previous work on this film and it shows and flows  evenly. Take note future producers, this is how to successfully make a  YA adaption, which surprisingly, is just as impressive as the book. Yet  unfortunately leaves us with far more questions than answers by the  end. Based on the trilogy by James Dashner expect more answers to  follow in sequel movies in the soon to be massive franchise. Or, you  know \\x85 you can read the books before hand? Ultimately, you do not have  to be a fan of the books, or even a YA to enjoy the film it, it has  something for almost everyone.  The Maze Runner arrives in US cinemas 19th September, and UK cinemas on  10th October. Be sure to check back soon and read our exclusive  interview with director Wes Ball, and leading cast; Dylan O'Brien, Will  Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Brace yourselves Maze Runner fans!\",\n",
       " \"I wrote this review because there was no updated review on IMDb.The first of Naruo Shippuden three seasons were alright they weren't bad but also they weren't that good They dragged the story too much the pacing was slow and by slow I mean really slow ,the battle scenes took several episodes where they can be done with one or two and that almost killed the show ,it's too bad because the story and the characters and very interesting. But after season 3 the anime improve in every aspect the no more slow paced story, spaced battles everything gets better animation, action scenes, sound track and especially the story , I mean it's like it's a totally different anime from what it's started(in a good way of curse) and up till now it keeps getting better and better.Story: The story have humor, action ,tragedy , romance and twists in it and the anime present it so well it makes it worth your while to bear with the first three seasons and some fillers here and there(which are not that bad).In case of characters: most of characters are well designed and easy to relate to ,even some of the Villains ,every characters is unique in his/her own way and have depth.The animations are good...not the best out there but pretty decent for a TV series.Sound track is amazing and fits well in the scenes especially the fighting scenes.So eventually if you are a Naruto fan, you can't miss this anime, it started not that good but it became one of the best anime I've watched. I gave it 9/10 despite the disappointing slow paced first three seasons (~70 episodes)because afterward it gets so good that it covers it up the mess in the first 3 seasons.\",\n",
       " 'I have recently watched anime \"Naruto: Shippuden\", it received rave reviews, my brother recommended it to me. I was rather sceptic about it, because it was my first anime in my life, but after few episodes I had to admit that \"Naruto: Shippuden\" is wonderful anime.This anime was being filmed for 10 years. It tells a long story of a boy called Naruto who was born in a ninja world and his dream was to become a Hokage.During all anime we see how Naruto literally grows up before our eyes, from weak guy who was alone all his childhood to the greatest shinobi of all time. We see all his difficult path trough the violent ninja world.The plot is very intriguing, and I think that storyline is very gripping and sometimes touching. The amount of episodes is certainly very big(over 710 episodes) but it even prolongs the pleasure from watching this anime, even the fillers were interesting to watch.I find all the characters from \"Naruto: Shippuden\" very likeable, and so I was very curious to know about the storyline of every character whether it is a main character or a secondary one.To sum up, \"Naruto: Shippuden\" is a very motivating and thought-provoking anime because the world in this anime is similar to our in many aspects. The idea of this anime is unique and I think it is the greatest anime of all time. If,like me, you like good-filmed and breath-taking animes, I would certainly recommend it for you.',\n",
       " 'There is a moment in one of Terry Pratchett\\'s brilliant Discworld novels where the protagonist\\'s \"organiser\", a magical device reminding the owner of his daily appointments, breaks, so it starts reciting the schedule from an alternate universe where the characters made the wrong choices with awful results.This feels like a show made in that darker timeline.Maybe the producers were making their own steampunk cop show and decided to slap Discworld names on it as a marketing afterthought. Imagine if someone was planning an on-the-road sci-fi/comedy and, by some dark miracle, managed to get the Lord of the Rings license from the Tolkien Estate: cue a LOTR version where a bunch of stoner hobbits and an insane cackling Gandalf ride speeder bikes towards Mordor through a cyberpunk Middle-earth; Aragorn is a woman, Galadriel a dude, Gollum a politically-minded revolutionary and everyone else is missing. That\\'s The Watch. I\\'m no purist when it comes to adapting books to screen... but when setting, plot, tone and pretty much all characters are unrecognizable, you should just create your own original work instead of bastardizing someone else\\'s.Some of the actors could have been fine in a proper adaptation, like Dormer as Vimes - if the iconic character had not been turned into a punk Jack Sparrow. Vimes - who is, with Granny Weatherwax, one of Discworld\\'s more complex, nuanced characters among so many memorable ones - was, pre-development, a broken, depressed drunk, not a goofball. Nearly every member of the Watch has been tinkered with in similarly deplorable ways, to say nothing of Sybil.Also, how do you ruin the running joke of the huge Carrot being an adoptive/honorary dwarf? Why, you cast other tall actors as dwarfs! It takes some special kind of anti-genius to mess this up.So, as its own thing? Not good. As an adaptation? Offensive, tone-deaf and nightmarishly bad. We\\'ll always have dozens of great Discworld novels, I know, but it\\'s sad we couldn\\'t get a good Watch TV series as well.1/10',\n",
       " 'How dare BBC America create this abomination and declare it is based on anything Sir Terry Pratchett wrote, the screenplay for this was clearly written by some imbecile who had never seen a Discworld novel before let alone ever read one.This is written, produced and directed by the same people that Terry Pratchett lampooned in the discworld series of books calling themselves the \"CAMPAIGN FOR EQUAL HEIGHTS\" a group of Humans who claim to be campaigning on behalf of the dwarves (Clearly because they felt so superior to dwarves that the dwarves themselves were incapable of campaigning on their own behalf) yet caring little to nothing what the dwarves themselves might have to say about it).If this mention of Sir Terry was supposed to get Sir Terry Pratchett\\'s millions of fans on board they have clearly missed the target by at least three Dimentions and a whole Universe.This abomination stands as testiment that the people who have assumed the mantle of \"GUARDIANS OF ENTERTAINMENT\" for themselves in the discworld they would be \"THE CAMPAIGN FOR EQUAL HEIGHTS\" have any sense of humour or even a base knowledge of IRONY (No it doesn\\'t mean having the properties of IRON).The title and the line \"Based on the characters from Terry Pratchett\\'s Discworld novels\" promises the Pratchett fan a cornucopia of Discworld feasts (See Nanny Oggs Cookbook) but delivers a dogsh__ sandwich.',\n",
       " 'One of the things I keep hearing about this show is that it is not a direct interpretation of Sir Terry\\'s phenomenal discworld, but it is inspired by it.\\nI don\\'t buy it. I think someone somewhere decided that they would cash in on one of Pratchett\\'s most fleshed out segments of the novels, the city watch, in name and name alone, and totally missed the mark. I didn\\'t expect it to be a love letter to Pratchett or fan service, but I did expect the characters to still at least have the same core that made them such treasures to read. Sam Vines is not Sam Vimes, it\\'s true...\"That\\'s not my cow.\" At least not after the first episode. Same goes for each and every character from Angua to Detritus to Carrot to good old Dog botherer. I don\\'t even care about the gender swap. Just give me the impression that there\\'s a Machiavellian mind that\\'s twelve steps ahead of everyone else working its magic behind the scenes, and I\\'ll be happy.\\nBut here is where it really stings. You can tell that everyone really is trying. The performances for the most part are committed, albeit misinformed, the production value is decent, aside from Detritus\\'s distracting appearance. And the punk vibe could have actually made for an interesting twist, but it just comes off as forced and therefore, pointless and shallow.\\nI can only hope it gets better.',\n",

The aesthetics are ugly. The characters are that in name only. Their actions make no sense UNLESS you\\'ve read the books. If you\\'ve read the books your head will start throbbing because again these actions make no sense for this character in the current context.The people who\\'ve made this clearly have no love for Pratchett\\'s work or any consideration for the fanbase.In The books we are introduced to Vimes piss drunk in the gutter.

       " 'Nothing of this show is remotely true to the original work of Terry Pratchett. Well, maybe Carrot\\'s hair colour, but even his character gets a bad treatment of getting a changed background and impact.It is really sad to see what happened to this. Its like the creators only read the summaries, usually find at the back of the books, and mangled them into a story. Nothing fits to the true work, as characters appearing later in the watch series are not only present at the start, but with their character arcs completed.It also is not funny, or humorous, or insightful, or sarcatic, or ironic, or satire. Its just bland, bad and poor. Every Terry Pratchett fan should save themself from exposure to this and stay as far away from it as possiple.PS\\nYou may think about comments about race- and genderchanging of characters. Yes. That happens. It does neither add nor detract on how awful the show is. Dont even think about \"wokeness\" when the base concept is just disgusting. Even the acting is sub-par, but the worst is just the writing.',\n",

And that is the problem, the show knows it never has to worry about money, or be able to sell the show in other countries, so they can go the low effort way instead. This seems to be made by people who was told about DW in passing, and just filled in the blanks with fan fiction from twitter. It\\'s sad to see people defending the show, because \"Hey, look they gender swap a character, how funny\", when said thing because a mockery of the original story and are just done to hide the failure of all involved in understanding the source material. I now see why the estate of Terry Pratchett and his daughter have washed their hands of this project, and said it shares nothing with the stories he made, other that the theft of the names of those involved. In a time with so much pain and hopelessness I don\\'t see why we have to add more into it, the original stories where fun, innovating and self critic in a way, this this is just sad really.\\nIn short all things you loved from the books are gone, change or dumbed down. If you want to see DW in moving picture from, look up the movies and animations, even though the budget was smaller and they are older they are still light years ahead from even the goal of this series.',\n",
       " \"Chuck is a story about a guy who gets a bunch of government secrets downloaded into his head. Being stuck with this dangerous and powerful knowledge, he gets to work with an agent from the CIA and an agent from the NSA to do good in the world. Incidentally, the CIA agent is the girl of his dreams, Sarah.The development of this show is nearly flawless. The humour is actually funny. And Chuck (Levi) and Sarah (Strahovski) have amazing chemistry. Fitting with the nature of the show, the missions are somewhat unbelievable yet highly entertaining. There are side plots and pop culture references, and the soundtrack is usually excellent. As a bonus, there are quite a few famous guest stars such as Linda Hamilton and Timothy Dalton.Naturally, a large part of the story revolves around the romance between Chuck and Sarah. The pacing of this development is really quite impeccable and yet not overly annoying. They are such a cute couple that the show is worth watching just for this. How the writers managed to fit great dialogue in with humour and espionage is really quite surprising.Of course, nothing is perfect and I did deduct 2 stars from this show. The primary reason is Season 5, which I'm sure a lot of people hated for various reasons. Mainly, Season 5 felt like the show was going on too long, like a joke told where no one laughs. The show just kind of lost its momentum by then. I actually watched this show twice but the second time around I just skipped that season. There are other reasons to dislike Season 5 but I'll leave that for you to judge. I also found Scott Krinsky's character Jeff Barnes a little too annoying.Concluding, I really liked Chuck. It is a gem of television and definitely worth a watch.\",\n",
       " \"Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10\",\n",
       " \"A damn good movie. One of the best of 2003 in my view.This movie made me laugh, and it really pulled me in.At first I was afraid this would be another bad Pirate movie. I went to see it anyway, as I've always loved the legends of pirates, and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadrupul. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done.Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the british fleet.A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book.\",\n",
       " 'This film impressed me right after the first viewing, in August 2003, after which the following followed and so quietly peacefully, imperceptibly, I probably approached the mark of ten views. In principle, it\\'s worth it, this film can already be called a legend, and it\\'s a pleasure to watch such films.And now also compare with the sequel, but in fact someone seriously believes that the sequel came out better than the first episode. I, of course, do not agree with this, but I will not argue, everyone has an opinion, and there will be euphoria from viewing (views) of the \"Deadlock Chest\" and people will soberly look at the \"Curse of the Black Pearl\" and realize that the second part is not even nearby worth, but it is also a product of the highest class.The first film is better, maybe not all, but in humor and the plot exactly, and even such a banal sign as novelty, in the second part we saw only a sequel, a slightly different story with the same characters, and in the first film, it was all new , and moments are brilliant. When I speak genius with regard to this film, then, of course, I have the look of Jack Sparrow in the incredible performance of Johnny Depp.\\nThis is one of his best roles, from the very beginning he was performed in a genuinely brilliant way, from the first appearance on the screen to the eighth when he sailed on a small boat, flowing through all the cracks, to excellent music - completely capturing the episode, one of the best in all movie. And his first step to Port Royal, an English colony in the Caribbean. And after it began ...The whole genius of Jack Sparrow\\'s image can not be conveyed in words, that\\'s why we watch this film and review it time after time, and expect the continuation. Especially the second part is the benefit of Jack, and in the first and except for Jack there was a lot of interesting things.About humor, plot, music, I already said. And also this is the Captain of the \"Black Pearl\" Barbossa, some minor characters among the Barbosa pirates and among Jack\\'s team. In addition, you can add to the appearance of Jack in the city of Torturra, a meeting with old friends and friends. Or repeated scenes, when Barbossa and Sparrow are in one frame. All these and other episodes can only be admired, for, they do not bother and remain in the memory.\\nThe plot of the first part is much more interesting than the plot of continuation, besides the ship full of skeletons under the moonlight, where it surpasses the ship from the team in the form of sea monsters-yudisch. Special effects are here and there at a level, at a high level.Pirate films now go to the screens of the world a little, and no one can surpass the Pirates of the Caribbean Sea, here in fact there is even a romantic story between Elizabeth and William, the only problem for them is that it moves back to the second or third plan , thanks to the excellent performance of pirates of their roles.Young Bloom and Knightley could not support the level of their older colleagues, I would say that it\\'s forgivable for them, if they were not so important to the director and producers, and in the eyes of ordinary fans of this film, they are not visible, they swam far beyond the horizon, only, unfortunately, sometimes appear on the screen saying important phrases, for me these characters are superfluous.\\nAbout Bloom, you can talk separately, his goal is to play a simpleton, spinning around the main character, sometimes trying to throw out an incredible and very daring trick, in the first part he still copes with the role of a simpleton, but when he tries to play the guy, everything fails, he does not go, and should run all career in a skirt of Paris. And in the second part of it they are already trying to make a serious man, give a chance to steer at the head of the film, but time to think, because Jack can not block him, and he does not want to be funny, but could try, maybe an idiot with the protagonist - his role ?The screen time for the Knightley-Bloom duo is very little allocated, I mean when they are together, and for this it is necessary to say a special thanks to the creators of the film, this does not allow to turn the film into a love story of two childhood friends, but, damn it, from time to time they turn out to be in one frame, and these frames can easily be called not the most interesting for the whole film, in the sense of an acting game, because these young actors do not show anything super-ordinary.\\nDitch the ocean, shoot cannons (even with forks), rob ships and ports here is the destiny of pirates, and after they also appear on the screen under the magnificent setting of Verbinsky - that\\'s the real movie. The spark from the sensations is getting stronger, the film practically does not allow him to tear himself away for two and a half hours of viewing, except for the episodes of Knightley-Bloom, but this does not prevent the movie from watching when Jack Sparrow appears from the second to the second.The film really deserves only flattering reviews. The ending of the film, although romantic, but much better than in the second part, when I did not see the ending, it was simply not invented - it\\'s the main and very big minus of the second part, but now the conversation is not about it, because the first part ended very much in rating , I do not mean the MPAA rating, but the main thing is that it\\'s a cobblestone in the sequel garden.This movie you will remember as the best one in which Captain Jack Sparrow was almost hanged.',\n",
       " 'If there\\'s ever proof of the cachet of Naval Aviation, this is it. Those poor Air Force guys got a trio of \"Iron Eagle\" flicks that went from bad to horrible, whereas the Navy flyboys got this great 1980\\'s classic. Sure, it\\'s cheesy and corny, but it makes the cheese and corn taste pretty damn good. A cynic might argue that it\\'s just a two hour long Navy recruiting ad (one that worked for me, two years later I found my ass in Pensacola sweating through AOCS, short for Aviation Officer Candidate School, the program immortalized in \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") but by making a pro-Navy movie, the filmmakers also got invaluable technical assistance from top Navy aviators, and it shows.For starters, although this movie takes numerous liberties in order to entertain, the basic setup, in which fighter pilots from the fleet get sent to NAS Miramar, aka, \"Top Gun\" for intensive training, is 100% accurate. The Navy, back during Vietnam, was getting sick of losing too many pilots in air-to-air combat. The problem, they discovered, was their fighter jocks had been trained for purely long-range missile interceptions, meaning they\\'d lost their dogfighting skills. And, in Vietnam, several American planes were accidentally shot down by their own side by missiles, so, as a safety factor, enemy planes had to be visually identified, meaning American pilots were back to engaging the enemy at short range, hence the need for dogfighting. The \"Top Gun\" school was started as a result, and the rest is history.Now, back to the movie. Tom Cruise is Maverick, a hotshot pilot but also somewhat unstable. If \"Risky Business\" launched his career as a movie star, then \"Top Gun\" cemented it. Guys wanted to be like him, and women of course lusted after him. The plot is pure formula, but executed with consummate professionalism. The team who put this movie together knew exactly how to push all the right buttons. But the crème de la crème is surely the flying. I don\\'t think that any movie, before or since, has ever rendered air combat in a more convincing and dramatic fashion. For nearly 100 years fighter pilots have been the modern equivalent of olden knights, men who brought a sense of glamour and romance to the deadly art of war, and this movie gives them a fitting tribute.8/10',\n",
       " 'A Legend in it\\'s own time.Timeless classic.Really does get better with age.Yep, all of the above are true and many more platitudes that are bandied about or discussed when this film is mentioned. I struggle to grasp why this has a sub 7 rating on here, especially considering some of the dire films that have been rated 9 or above on IMDb, this film deserves a much higher rating.It\\'s a great night in with \"pizza and popcorn\" movie, more fun if everyone has seen it before so you can play the Top Gun quote game. I\\'d love to see this on the big screen with the full sound system to hear the big adrenaline rush that comes with hearing the jets screaming around and the music pumping. Even though I happily watch it at home of a 40 inch TV with a 5.1 PC audio system which isn\\'t exactly lacking in power or effect...It\\'s a fun if somewhat cheesy 80\\'s film that is of course a formula film that was repeated several times (Especially with Tom Cruise starring in them!) with a soundtrack that is still as good today as it was in the late 80\\'s when this film came out. The plot may be paper thin but the action, the music and the quotability and great fun of the film is what makes it so much fun to watch and gives it massive replay value.It\\'s fast paced action sequences and aerial cinematography are top notch, simply breathtaking and stunning for the most. The drama of the shooting is the backbone of this film, the adrenaline it can induce is spectacular and some of the shots are simply haunting.The humour is laugh out loud funny and it featured some bloody good looking men and great looking women so the eye candy is never far away. The film has very few lulls and the action is never far away. It has emotion and feeling but always gets back into the Danger Zone pretty quick with characters that are likable and fun to watch. The casting was very well done and you can sense that the cast and crew must have had a riot while making this film (With The exception of Iceman/Val Kilmer, who actually kept himself apart from the crew for the most to allow for his character to be felt as a true outsider.)As may be apparent I\\'m a Top Gun fan, have been since I first watched this film, I was gripped from the opening chimes of the epic Top Gun theme followed by that big haired 80\\'s guitar riff and the initial sounds of engines winding up as the steam drifts across the deck of the aircraft carrier. I\\'m a firm believer that if this film doesn\\'t get your stuff going at some point, your stuff is broken. It\\'s not a film to be taken seriously, it\\'s meant to be enjoyed with friends and laughed along with. The film may have a few plot holes, there are about a million goofs, it spawned more than a handful of web sites to point out all the goofs and flaws in the film, dialogue and all other things Top Gun related but it\\'s got a fan base the size of a massive army and for a reason, it\\'s just a good movie because of all that.The soundtrack and aerial footage really are the stars of this film, even though the cast was pretty huge, the Director Tony Scott really went all in and made a huge effort with Top Gun (Even at his own personal expense considering he ended up hiring a US Aircraft carrier to get a shot just how he wanted!)It\\'s just one of those films if you like it, whenever it is on, you can sit down and watch it no matter where you walked in, or turned over and found it was on. It\\'s like a really comfortable pair of slippers that always feel good to slip on when you get the chance. I often wish I could turn back the clock to being a teenager again to watch it for the first time all over again and get the chills down my spine as each action sequence gears up; the rush as the roar of the F-14 engines scream and howl. I envy the people who have not seen this film as they have experience the roller-coaster ride that this film can offer.It\\'s funny as I was inspired to come write this review after meeting someone the other week who had not seen Top Gun, which for me has been a rare experience. In fact I don\\'t know many people who do not own either a copy if the VHS or a DVD of Top Gun, and most of my friends have the OST in their music collection or the larger part of it as Singles/MP3\\'s.If you have not seen it, get on ebay or Amazon or wherever, spend a few quid and buy a copy, get some friends around for the night, snag some beer, popcorn, pizza or tofu if that floats your boat and have a great night in. If you don\\'t take it too seriously you should have a good night.If you have seen it and enjoyed it, get on here and give it some love and vote it up, if only to get it ranked above a lot of the rubbish ranked highly.It\\'s also worth watching the DVD extras/Making of Top Gun if you liked the film as it\\'s pretty interesting stuff and very funny in parts, as some of the trivia about the film is fascinating.',\n",
       " \"Top Gun is a high quality, visually stunning film that does all it can to take your breath away. It is the excellently choreographed dog fights that remain in the mind longer than anything as they are high octane, dazzling bursts of excitement which bring the film to life. However, fighter jet sequences do not make a film and it is the plot where Top Gun has some occasional problems.Parts of the story are overly cheesy and clichéd. The proud to be American theme is dire, repetitive and anyone who dislikes over patriotism in films will despise this. The story line involving Tom Cruise and Tom Skerrit approaches boredom and is the pinnacle of Top Gun's cheese. 'Cheese' is OK, as long as it is not serious and that is where that specific story line falls flat. The fun cheesy parts are some of the films best moments. The volleyball scene is truly a classic and the four actors involved are genuinely enjoying themselves. The relationship between Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards is also very moving at times and the dynamic they have makes for great viewing.The acting is what saves Top Gun from being Tinsel town garbage. Tom Cruise launched his career with this film. His cocky smile makes him perfect for this role and Cruise does fantastically at portraying a determined, passionate character. It is the emotional scenes where Cruise really sets himself apart from his peers. Cruise provides the few scenes where the audience are made to feel any emotion and he carries out his responsibility creditably. Anthony Edwards as Goose is also effective as the man who takes second spot to Cruise's Maverick. He is instantly popular with the audience with his wit, humour and charm. Val Kilmer and Rick Rossovich are great as the rivals. They play off each other really well and do a fantastic job to personify arrogance. Michael Ironside does what he does best and once again, manages to go through a whole film without smiling.The story between Cruise and Kelly McGillis is very romantic and sensual. The heat between them is conveyed very well on screen and it is this that sets Top Gun above films such as Iron Eagle and Chuck Norris films.Berlin's 'Take My Breath Away' is a song that still gets a good deal of airplay and suits this film to perfection; it's cheesy and its 80s. The music is very effective at setting the mood and complements the feel of the film.Top Gun is a film that achieves its objectives, to entertain. If you're looking for intelligent writing or mass thought provocation, this film isn't for you. Top Gun is best suited to those who desire to switch off their brain and enjoy.\",\n",
       " \"One of those roles you cannot imagine anyone except Tom Cruise playing.An 80s classic that is soooooo cheesey, it is a great Sunday afternoon film to enjoy with a cold beer.A film you can watch multiple times over the years and still enjoy it.

       " 'The following is an excerpt from a non-fiction story I wrote entitled \"Eighteen Years from Olean.\" Copyright 2004. All Rights Reserved.The set up is that I\\'m 18 years old, and about one week after my graduation from High School. I\\'ve been having a one year, long distance romance with a girl named Tammy. I\\'ve driven 500 miles to surprise her, and here\\'s what we did the first night I arrived\\x85 Chapter 11 The Castle Cinema; Olean, New York; Summer 1986 We came back to her place, had dinner with her mom\\x97I don\\'t remember anyone else being there\\x97and Tammy suggested that we see a movie. There was a new film playing in town that she really wanted to see and asked me if I would take her. Of course I would.The local two screen cinema was called The Castle, and my memory tells me that it was\\x97not surprisingly\\x97built like a castle, with spires, and uneven brick around the top like Jack-O-Lantern teeth. She told me the name of the movie and I distinctly remember thinking what a stupid title. It sounded like a cheesy cowboy movie. I had not heard of it\\x97it was very new\\x97and was certain that it was going to suck. I despised westerns. But I would try to suffer through this horrible movie for her sake, knowing full and well that I would hate it.The film was Top Gun.Boy was I wrong.Top Gun was the paradigm of 80\\'s cinema. By that I mean it was a high-octane action/adventure film with a script filled with campy dialog, and a thin, formulaic plot that was driven by a kick-ass soundtrack. It was common of the motion pictures during that decade for the music to be the star; one long rock video, like the ones we watched on that new network MTV (back when they actually played videos).I\\'m only a little embarrassed to tell you that Top Gun changed my life. I had already started skydiving by then and the visuals of aviation and the attitude of the pilots drew me in. I saw that movie not less than ten times while it was still playing in theaters, and countless times since on video and DVD. Even now I know every line by heart. It was the script for my generation, introducing such phrases as \"Talk to me Goose,\" \"It\\'s time to buzz the tower\", \"Let\\'s turn and burn\", \"call the ball\" and \"I feel the need\\x85the need for speed.\" Obviously I wasn\\'t the only one infatuated with this movie. Top Gun was the winner of the People\\'s Choice Award for 1986, nominated for four Academy Awards (winning one), catapulting six of its songs to Billboard\\'s Top 10, and, oh yeah, it grossed three-hundred million dollars world-wide. It was a popular film. On a practical note, my repeated viewings of Top Gun in theaters taught me an invaluable lesson about performance.Throughout my time in theater, mostly plays, we were always told that there is no bad audience, only a bad performance. That\\'s a lie.A film doesn\\'t change from performance to performance. Every line is delivered exactly the same way, with the same timing and the same inflection. The performance give by the actors is identical each time it\\'s viewed; exactly as it was the instant it was captured on film. Yet, I noticed that each time I saw Top Gun in a cinema, the audience reacted differently.Sometimes they would laugh at the humorous parts, other times not. A few times they cheered when Maverick shot the last MIG, and once or twice they actually chuckled when Goose hit his head on the canopy, breaking his neck. The live people in the audience never, in fact, responded the same way at any two showings of the film. Now since the movie changed not one iota, I came to the conclusion that there are indeed bad audiences.On occasion, when I have a show that tanks, I reminded myself of the Top Gun rule, and it brings me comfort.Sometimes.',\n",
       " \"This movie was released even before I was born. Tom was also quite young in this movie. This movie was my favorite movie for a long time, it is still in my top 3 movies. In fact, this movie was responsible for Tom cruise's stardom. I heard in that year 1986, a lot of guys wanted to be pilots just because of this movie.Top Gun is a story of pilot Pete Mitchell code name Maverick who is regarded dangerous pilot by the navy. Pete's father disappears in 1965 Vietnam war. So, his father was considered reckless pilot by everyone. Maverick knows his father was a great pilot and he didn't screw up. But still there's a stigma attached to his family name. So, Maverick always tries to endeavor very hard when he flies.Top Gun is a film about emotion, passion and most importantly ego of Maverick. Top Gun shows all the flavors of emotions. It shows desperation of Maverick not to be second. Maverick has only one friend Goose. Goose is his family. Nobody likes Maverick, but Goose. Maverick doesn't want to risk Goose's job, by doing some unnecessary stints in the sky, but his desperation and ego to be better than others due what happened to his father, never listens to him.Tom Cruise pulls off performance of his life in this movie. He is well complimented by Kelly Mcgillis (Charley), Val Kilmer (Iceman) and Anthony Edwards (Goose). My fad for Top Gun is such that I had Maverick as my username on my email id for years. I've sen this flick more than 50 times. I know every dialogue in this movie. This movie is a top notch and as far as movie characters are concerned, Tom Cruise will always be remembered as Maverick than any other characters he has played.\",\n",
       " \"Maybe this is something of a U.S. military naval recruitment film but if taken not too seriously, this testosterone laced movie actually makes for quite entertaining viewing. The jet maneuvers shown are both impressive & exciting and might tend to increase the viewer's respect (as it certainly did mine) for the amazing skill and incredible nerve of real life fighter pilots. The story revolves around a bold, daring, and overconfident navy fighter pilot, Lieutenant Pete Mitchell (call name 'Maverick'), who is sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School along with his close pal, Goose. Maverick strives to prove himself the best pilot in this demanding course, but faces both stiff competition from a fellow pilot named Iceman as well as personal conflict dealing with his own haunting demons following the mysterious death of his father, also an air ace pilot. Meanwhile, he falls for a lovely civilian astrophysics instructor, Charlotte (Charlie) Blackwood.Tom Cruise is well cast in the role of the hotshot pilot...the cocky, audacious, fearless, but ultimately conflicted and anguished Maverick. Kelly McGillis portrays his often antagonistic love interest, Charlie, who's as smart as she is pretty. Other stars include Tom Skerrit as a real top gun flight instructor, Commander Metcalf (Viper), who proves to be both a skilled and professional pilot but also a compassionate individual. Meg Ryan appears in her screen debut as Goose's perky, fun loving young wife, Carole Bradshaw, a minor role and one which I personally found rather irritating.I half expected that I'd find this movie just all too macho, but it's actually quite engaging to watch. Maverick's personal story, his inner strife, and his romance with Charlie prove less riveting than the incredible airborne stunts with these jets. Yes, they have to be among the best aerial shots ever. This film was made during the Cold War era with its USSR enmity so there are appearances by enemy Russian MiG fighters, naturally cast as the intrusive villains of the piece. The film also does a great job at depicting all the male bonding between these pilots...the camaraderie, rivalry, banter, inter dependency, and genuine close friendship.Maverick is a fighter pilot who, according to Charlie, is only happy when he's 'going Mach Two with his hair on fire'. He's heard to remark just prior to climbing into the cockpit, 'I feel the need for speed'. He also takes great delight in unexpected and forbidden fly byes next to the control tower, scaring the living daylights out of his colleagues and causing them to spill their coffee. I love the little paper airplane touch with Charlie! Guess how Maverick transports himself around the city while on the ground...that's right, zipping about on a motorcycle!The movie features highly effective cinematography of these jets taking off from the aircraft carrier, all accompanied by a fabulous racy musical soundtrack. The romantic scenes are of course to the Oscar winning song 'Take My Breath Away'. Although it certainly features its sad moments, Top Gun is on the whole simply a lively and fun movie to watch.\",\n",
       " 'The acting was solid. The production value was superb. Everything else was really poor.The back story and character motivations are laughably sparse. Most of the characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible exception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all action plots - some \"bad dudes who happen to be really ugly\" decide to \"destroy the world for no reason other than being evil\" and \"only our hero can save us all\", etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time. Of course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn\\'t expect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made with a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the surefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard to fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in 2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.',\n",
       " \"Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. This sequel is one such moment. I do need to see it again. In terms of pure enjoy-ability, I put it top 3 of all sequels that I have enjoyed.What I really liked...-Every single character gets a moment to shine and every single actor cast in these parts are perfect. -The comedy is perfect. It's such a fine balance overall and everything works because it's very subtle and fits in with certain circumstances. -Some very tender emotional scenes. I won't spoil anything with specifics. -Some superb action and what could very well be award winning special effects. -All characters interactions are great and handled very well. This is a fantasy story that really cares about character first and it shows all the way through. Even Natalie Portman's Jane feel more fleshed out than she did in the original film. -The set pieces and other realms talked about in the first are seen here and are beautiful and well done. Asgard was even better believe it or not. -The mid-credit and end credit scenes, both cool. Make sure you stay for both.Marvel hit a pure home run with this endeavor. This film works because of the great cast and the fact that they took this subject matter seriously but remember to have fun. Chris Hemsworth was again perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.\",\n",
       " 'The first Thor was probably one of Marvel\\'s more trickier movies since it centered heavily around Norse mythology. To make it work in the \"real\" world was a massive task. Integrating a billionaire playboy who doubles as a tech-powered superhero, or a scientist who turns into a green rage monster was easier to accomplish than the fantastic world of Asgard, Gods & Monsters.Credit must go to Kenneth Brannagh who found the right balance between the fantastic and \"real\" (that\\'s a stretch anyways) world. Furthermore, Brannagh focused on the characters instead of bombastic vfx (he still provided tons of beautiful shot visuals though).His replacement Alan Taylor however goes in the opposite direction and favors stylish visuals over character development. Worse still, the pacing and tone are all over the place.The Dark World tries to hard to provide the same brand of humor Joss Whedon is known for but fails to deliver the laughs, or they are rather misplaced.Bottom line: It\\'s a too unfocused movie that suffers from a weak script and a director who tries too many things at the same time.',\n",
       " \"Having just watched a premier screening, I am delighted to come away from the cinema to write a positive review. Thor Dark World is a spectacular special effect driven film, much of which is set in Asguard.I was worried that including Loki yet again might become a little repetitive, but in this film he excels as a great character, I only hope however that they don't overdue his presence in the Marvel Universe. How many times can this guy come back from the dead?There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but its noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.The armies of Asguard were noticeably lacking in fire-power and weapons (even though they have an armoury), which is made even more evident when an entire guard division bring knives to a laser-gun fight. Their turrents were the only defense they had against an Ariel assault and proved to be practically useless. You would expect them to be better prepared.The healing powers of Thor, Jane, and even a smashed alien space-craft become a bit of a running joke as well. But at least they get hurt, even if it only takes them a scene to heal. And if smashing every column holding up a building is still not enough to take it down I'm not sure what will be. Christopher Eccleston played a competent bad guy, although his intentions for what he was doing was still unclear as to why. Its simple to say he was insane and just wanted to kill everybody, but when a threat of that magnitude appears and planetary alignments are in effect, you expect half the Universe to show up and stop him or take advantage of the situation, or come looking to take the power for themselves. I also expected to see the entire army of Asguard come to help out at the end like they apparently did in the past. Not just Thor who appears there by mistake.The scientist with the miraculous plot saving devise is also a little hard fetch to take in, especially when he creates a remote control for cosmic anomalies. Along with Loki's illusion power which also serves as a convenient plot-saving devise at times. I'm willing to overlook these but there's no denying what they are. Overall its a good enjoyable superhero movie, which you will want to watch several times and is a decent entry into the Marvel Universe.P.S. Watch it in 2D, The 3D added little of worth.\",\n",
       " \"There are a number of reasons why I found this film to be disappointing, unlike its predecessor which I enjoyed very much.1) Underdeveloped Bad Guy Syndrome: I know almost nothing about the bad guy even after watching the film. A dark elf who wants to blow everything up. Apparently that's all we need to know and all we'll ever know about the main villain in the film.2) Pointless Main Characters: The main characters in this film offer nothing of substance or value. For example, you could have replaced Jane with any other character without affecting the film. She exists solely as plot vehicle. The film does not explore her relationship with Thor, her reaction as a character to being transported to a different world, etc., etc. She's as thin as cardboard, like the rest of the main characters of this film.3) Very Poor Humor: Almost all of the jokes in this film made me roll my eyes and groan. It's as if the script writers liked the humor in Avengers and attempted to duplicate it without any knowledge of how.4) Ridiculous Plot Devices: Things in this movie only happen because the script says they have to. For example, Jane being the one possessed by the dark energy. Or the car keys being discovered on another planet. These things make no sense but exist solely because they have to for the plot to continue. I hate that.I had high hopes for Thor II but in the end it was just another disappointing let down.\",\n",
       " \"Just got back from seeing this and thought I'd put in my thoughts.This is by far the most intricate and thoughtful of the Marvel films to date, with a great story and some superb performances, particularly Hiddleston's as Loki. The characters from previous Asgard related outings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3 dimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films that would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore further the motivations of the key protagonists. There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud humorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best superhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently the best movie I've seen this year.Don't miss this!\",\n",
       " 'Honestly, Thor was never my favorite superhero. I liked the first film, but did not make much enthusiasm, and in \"Avengers\" all my sympathies were given to Tony Stark. Therefore, \"Torah 2\" I waited without much trembling. And if it were not for my love for the Marvel franchise and not the prerequisite on which I managed to visit, then perhaps I would not even have gone to the movie to film ... And I would have lost much! \"Thor 2\" was just an excellent, incredibly exciting movie adventure. Unequivocally I can say that this film-sequel I liked much more than the first \"Thor\". The creators of the picture made a serious work on the mistakes, took into account many shortcomings of previous films and significantly raised the level of quality.In general, I was very pleased and pleasantly surprised. And now I will try to briefly describe my impressions, to reveal the pros and cons of this film.1. A fascinating and rather original story. \"Thor 2\" is a film with a completely new, separate narrative. Formally, it is the continuation of the first \"Torus\" and \"Avengers\", although the main storylines with these films are not connected in any way. Describe the story - it\\'s a thankless task, a great chance to give undesirable details. Therefore, I will confine myself to general remarks. Firstly, it is very gratifying that the plot of the film does not develop according to the scenario of the \"Renaissance of the Legend\", according to which, judging by everything, practically all the fantastic films released in the last year were shot. Secondly, it\\'s worth to praise the writers for the fact that the action develops systematically, powerful action scenes alternate with lyrical digressions and small humorous insertions - that\\'s why the film keeps the viewer\\'s attention for all two hours. Thirdly, I am glad that the film will not be delayed: everything is lively, bodrenko and laconic. Well, the last moment, which I wanted to comment on is the ending. For most viewers, it turned out to be very unexpected. As for the inconsistencies and some logical blunders, their presence seems inevitable for almost every fantastic film. Besides, in Torah 2 there are not so many of them (in comparison with the first film, at least).\\n2. Excellent graphics and special effects. Life in the 21st century taught me not to be surprised at anything. I do not know what special effects need to be invented so that in the current conditions they make a special impression. Therefore, \"Torah 2\" I\\'m not going to consider from the point of view of sensationalism and some novelty. Of course, if I had seen a schedule of this level even five years ago, then it is quite possible that I would lose my speech. Today, this film is just dignified. All special effects are well worked out. From this position, this picture can be safely put on a par with the same \"Man of Steel\", for example. There are, of course, individual details that looked excessively computerized and slightly unnatural, although for fiction it is forgivable. Of course, this tape is worth watching in 3D format, so as to maximize the effect of presence.3. Beauty! What not to take away from this film, so this is a beautiful picture. And for each viewer the understanding of this beauty will be very special. For example, the male half of the hall was fascinated by the unrealistically divine views of Asgard and really spectacular mass scenes. Their companions were much more interested in Thor himself, or even his material shell, which he actively demonstrated. Undoubtedly, all spectators, regardless of their gender and other characteristics, appreciated the beauty of the night sky, stars, incredible nature and architecture, which is abundantly presented throughout the film. A beautiful picture is accompanied by good music, which has already become quite traditional for the genre of fiction.\\n4. Friendly cast. After the \"Avengers\", it seemed that the actors\\' ensembles of the subsequent crossover movies Marvel would look bleak and insignificant. It is for this reason that the third \"Iron Man\" caught up with a bunch of actors who, in fact, played no special role in the development of the plot. In \"Torah 2\", the main actor\\'s skeleton was removed from the first film, and there were almost no new actors. Due to this, the screen does not create an overload in terms of unnecessary dialogues and unnecessary scenes, and the cast seems very friendly and united. Of course, the main thanks are due to Chris Hemsworth (who, incidentally, after the movie \"Race\" has grown very much in my eyes). He easily becomes the center of the film, brilliantly copes with all the tricks, comfortably feels in the costume of Thor (which is said to be terribly uncomfortable) and perfectly interacts with other actors. In this film, he makes his character more charismatic and profound - and this can not but rejoice. Natalie Portman, of course, is good. But she practically did not show her character development. Although, of course, it should be praised for her work, because in comparison with the first film, from a purely physical point of view, it was much harder for her. Loki Tom Hiddleston continues to be one of the most disgustingly attractive villains in the fantasy world. And the rest of the actors are an excellent way to distract attention from the main characters and bring to the film a share of humor and diversity.Also worth noting that the film is full of \"little joys\", calculated on a fan base. For example, very pleased with a small, but very funny cameo Chris Evans in the role of Captain America. Or already become a classic cameo by Stan Lee. There are also soul-stirring allusions to previous franchise films. And most importantly: do not forget to stay at the screen for a few minutes longer! You are waiting for two additional episodes: the first - after the incredibly colorful final titles, the second - after the usual basic titles. Both episodes are very interesting and directly lay the path to the next film Marvel ... (personally my rating of expectations after these episodes at times increased).\\nTOTAL. \"Thor 2\" is a spectacle that keeps the viewer in suspense from the first to the last seconds. Bright, colorful, saturated, dramatic and even quite unusual, moderately tragic and moderately ridiculous fantastic action, which is absolutely not a pity to spend two hours of free time. This is a solid and high-quality product, which you can safely forgive some plot flaws and inconsistencies. \"Thor 2\" - perhaps one of the best fantastic films of the year and one of the most worthy sequels for this genre.Unexpected, very nice gift. A real surprise for fans of fantasy and specifically the magnificent Marvel franchise, which, apparently, only gaining momentum ...Enjoy watching!',\n",
       " 'Thor The Dark World is brilliant and completely tops the first film. There are a lot of extremely funny bits in it as well as some dark and moving moments. Probably a much funnier movie than it had any right to be given the subject matter. Loki is done perfectly and the dialogue between him and Thor is superb.If you\\'re a fan of the first, this certainly won\\'t disappoint at all. Without spoiling anything, the scale of this film is very Avengers-like in that the action pieces are amazing. During a sequence halfway through, I literally turned to my friend and said, \"this is freakin\\' awesome\".Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama or intensity. I was expecting to simply see crazy mythology with monsters destroying the landscape of the nine realms for two hours. Instead, I was shocked at the depth and complexity of this film. You definitely need your brain and your heart turned on for this one, unlike other CGI mishmashes. If you want a movie with just dumb action and no plot then stay away from this exceptional film. The performances are top tier and the visual effects may be the best I\\'ve seen this year. I have to join the majority of people and even critics that are praising this film. It\\'s a true joy and such a pleasant experience.',\n",
       " \"It's big, it's dumb, it's cheesy as hell, but I found it to be enormous fun. This was made to be a roller-coaster ride and by that token it should be judged.Actually after the opening pastiche of the Boris Karloff Frankenstein movie, I thought this had the potential to be a 5 star movie. It was very atmospheric and had me hooked. However the film never really captures any sense of magic from there onwards.The main body of the movie does go on a bit, and it could have done with some attempt to create engaging characters. Plot and story are not always necessary for fun movies, but you do need characters with a level of interest to capture the mind, otherwise you tend to find yourself not giving a s**t. I felt Van Helsing did verge into this territory, but for the most part it's so fast paced this doesn't matter so much. The points where it does try to introduce plot are the moments where it really does fail. In fact there is too much going on that is never really explained, and I think it would've been better not to have bothered at all, than use the nonsense Sommers resorts too. For example the attempts at backstory to Van Helsing. Better to have one of those interlude chatty scenes you have in the Indy films, where it establishes he's a dude, rather than the poor attempts at angst and pathos. Really bad was the moment he gets upset over Frankie's Monster. What the hell was that all about?Hmm maybe I took that a bit seriously, but the movie knows what it is, why try be something else. I also thought that that masked ball sequence was a natural conclusion, the eventual finale at the castle felt like an add on, which lacked any real punch.Far better was Van's introduction to Transylvania, with the benefit of some neat angles and panning shots, the crossbow battle with the brides was cool. The coach chase was exciting without being exhilarating, but kept the flow going, so it's a shame some more bad plot gets thrown in, especially when it was involving the underwritten Velkan. That's the film's main problem - overkill of characters, with little space given to any of them to evolve.Finally a word on the CGI. I thought it was very good, especially the morphs that were used. The very first moment Drac starts to turn made me jump a touch, and when the vampires turns into their fanged, contorted state it looked pretty scary to me. The wolfman transformation, with the ripping flesh looked genuinely painful. At this point I was thinking the CGI was genuinely stunning. I'd have preferred the finale if it had just been Van vs Drac though, having CGI characters fight felt uninvolving, and Drac in snarly state was far better than the beast he turns into.This is a movie to genuinely switch of the brain and enjoy. At times there's too much going on and perhaps a bit too much swinging about for my liking, but it's an adrenaline filled ride. I'd probably give it 7 out of 10.\",\n",
       " \"Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Were it not for these two gifted performers, this movie would be beyond silly. As it is, the plot is almost pretextual for the special effects.The Eye Candy factor is high, though. Hugh Jackman as the tortured hero, filmed in the dark all of the time, makes us weak in the knees. Kate Beckinsale does magnificent physical feats while squeezed into a corset.The story: Van Helsing (Jackman) is essentially a bounty hunter of supernatural monsters, a job he took on at the request of the church as apparent penitence for sins he cannot even remember. As a reward for his centuries of service, he hopes to make his way to Heaven instead of Hell.Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is the last survivor of a family of Transylvanian vampire hunters. Her brother has become a werewolf and she is conflicted about whether he should live or die.Naturally Anna and Van Helsing team up to rid Transylvania of the evil vampire overlord. Van Helsing has a tool kit Batman would envy, and Anna maintains an arsenal of monster-killing weapons that would make a survivalist proud. Between the two of them, the monsters don't stand a chance.Put your mind on hold, suspend disbelief and intolerance for the occasional leap of reason, enjoy a slightly randy friar (Van Helsing's sidekick), and go along for the ride. Van Helsing is a great Sunday afternoon video.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m really baffled at the hateful negative response to this film. No it\\'s not Oscar material, it\\'s just good campy fun. If you\\'re a fan of old monster movies, James Bond and Indiana Jones flicks, and over-the-top humor in an action/horror movie, then you get it. I guess if you\\'re looking for a summer action flick that takes itself too seriously, then you\\'re out of luck with this one.I admit that the film runs a little to long, the chemistry between Beckinsale and Jackman leaves something to be desired, and the Frankenstein \"monster\" (though well-intentioned to give a nod to \"Young Frankenstein\") is really annoying. But the entertainment spawning from the hokey fun that \"Van Helsing\" is all about, makes these flaws so forgivable.For me, I\\'ll take the over-acting screaming Brides of Dracula, the silly homages to dozens of classic action and horror movies, the cheesy one-liners, and the not-so-convincing special effects. Isn\\'t that what monster movies are all about?',\n",
       " 'First a word of warning. There are a number of people who would be best advised to avoid Van Helsing. If you dislike cgi, if you\\'re a purist, if you\\'re looking for something \"realistic\", or if you\\'re looking for a slower-moving, understated film that\\'s a deep character study, you\\'ll more than likely hate this film.Set around the turn of the 20th Century, Van Helsing features the titular hero (Hugh Jackman) taking a break from his usual \"monster slayer\" activities, which are commissioned by the Catholic Church, to pursue a grand plot initiated by Dracula (Richard Roxburg) involving the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley), the Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and the two last surviving members of a Transylvanian family that has long been battling the vampire.Van Helsing is a fast-paced, computer graphics-laden horror/adventure/fantasy film wherein Universal re-imagines its core stable of classic horror characters. I actually like cgi, I\\'m not a purist, I love the genres--I\\'m not looking for realism, and I love fast-paced action-oriented thrill rides as much if not more than I love character studies.As for the character remakes, Van Helsing becomes a slick retro-Matrix-styled macho action hero, part James Bond/007, part Indiana Jones, part Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a secret Catholic Church order filling in for the Watcher\\'s Council and the Bond \"Q Branch\" combined. Dracula becomes a suave, scheming, mad scientist who looks like a romance novel hero. Frankenstein\\'s Monster becomes much closer to Mary Shelley\\'s depiction of an intelligent, loquacious, tormented, slapdash victim of a misguided doctor. And the Wolf Man, when wolf, becomes a cgi generated over-sized, super-agile, hyperactive beast. That should already turn off all of the purists.The look of the film is lush, with lots of unusual point of view shots, exotic locations and computer-generated environments. CGI is used extensively for the human characters in the film as well as the monsters--it\\'s frequently employed to enable physics defying stunts and amazing, far-ranging \"computer camera\" transitions. Van Helsing provides a good argument for such extensive digital assistance, as many of the visuals would be simply impossible to achieve through any other means and substituting some of the creatures with mechanicals, animatronics, special effects makeup and the like would have caused the film to go far over its already outrageous estimated budget of 160 million.The plot, while not deep on characterization, couldn\\'t be more full of events and action. Combined with the extravagant visuals and quickly changing, sprawling locations, the result is epic in scope. Director/writer Stephen Sommers, who was also responsible for remaking the image of another classic Universal character in The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001) (probably the reason the Mummy is not present in here), begins Van Helsing in a black and white scene that wonderfully recreates the feel of the James Whale-lensed Frankenstein films, including referencing a number of shots, scenes and characters from those classics.After the titles, we move into a color-filled world ala The Wizard of Oz while we\\'re treated to a brief character-establishing scene of Van Helsing battling Mr. Hyde in the bell tower of Notre Dame. Sommers then quickly whisks us away to the Vatican, where Van Helsing receives his orders.This whirlwind beginning can be almost overwhelming--it certainly is visually--and it takes a moment to get up to speed and catch our breath, but once we settle into the town square of Transylvania, we\\'re enraptured by the story and the pacing reaches a more sustainable level. Although fantastical at heart, the performances from the principle cast members help anchor the film in \"reality\". Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Roxburgh, Henley and David Wenham all turn in nuanced performances that imply the depth of character that the film does not have the time to fully explore.The intense action throughout the film combined with the cgi and spectacular sweeping camera moves often gives Van Helsing a feel somewhere between a comic book film and a video game. That fact might turn some viewers off, but as innovative, suspenseful, exciting filmic art, this is years ahead of most other recent releases. In fact, the sophisticated technological wizardry and entrancing epic storytelling is somewhat reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings films, which makes me wonder just what other viewers see in those to enable them to consistently sit high on the IMDb Top 250 list while Van Helsing struggles to attain a slightly above average rating. Perhaps Van Helsing deserves a more tempered first or second viewing from those who have summarily dismissed it due to unjustified expectations/preconceptions. This really is an outstanding film that at least deserves to be appreciated on a technical level, and should be easy enough to enjoy for its action-oriented storytelling prowess as well.',\n",
       " 'Many, many people have seen \"Van Helsing\" and said it is trash, a waste of time, etc, etc. But what they don\\'t understand is that sometimes, with so much happening in the world, people need to let it all go so they can get some thrills from movies.The plot of Van Helsing is somewhere between simple and complex. The back story is that Count Dracula and his three brides have given birth to countless offspring throughout the hundreds of years they\\'ve been living as vampires. They themselves were created from the living, but their children were not. They were born of the undead, and have never had the chance to come to life... or the afterlife vampires live. They simply are dead.Then, Dracula comes upon a mad scientist named Dr. Frankenstein, whom wants to discover the secret of creating life. He helps the doctor in his sort-of admirable task of creating life, hoping to use his creation to bring life to his children. But it is not to be. As the film opens, Dr. Frankenstein is killed by Dracula, who no longer needs him, and his monster, whom Dracula needs to give the essence of life to his children, appears to perish in a fire.A year later, Gabriel Van Helsing, a tortured man without a past is sent to Transylvania by the \"Holy Order\"... An organization of all of the religions of the world. With the assistance of a trusty sidekick, the still living monster of Frankenstein and a beautiful young woman, he must hunt down and destroy Dracula before he can give life to his thousands of children.The reason I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 is that is never seems to get the recognition it deserves. It has great action, great actors, and a great story. (At least for a summer film) It\\'s not the type of movie to be taken seriously, it\\'s the type to sit down with some friends, have some popcorn, and get ready for a silly, scary, fun ride. I love it!. 9/10',\n",
       " 'If you\\'re a purist-any kind of purist-stay away from Van Helsing. But if you love the Universal horror films of the 30\\'s and 40\\'s or the Hammer films of the 50\\'s and 60\\'s and don\\'t mind re-imagining them, then go. Check your brain at the door, buy a large popcorn and a soda and sit back for a fun ride.The film is a complete reworking of everything you think you know about all the big guys. Present for your enjoyment are Dracula, the Wolf man, Frankenstein\\'s monster and a guest appearance by Mr. Hyde. And of course, tying the whole thing together is our hero, Van Helsing (yummily played by Hugh Jackman). Named Abraham in Stoker\\'s book but called Gabriel in the film, VH doesn\\'t appear in any book other than Dracula, but in the more than a century since his `birth\\' we\\'ve become accustomed to his presence as the elder statesman of monster killers.Completely re-imagined in this new production, VH is now young, handsome, and virile and apparently as immortal and indestructible as the creatures he chases. Don\\'t expect great resolutions or deep explanations here, there are none. Don\\'t expect Academy Award level acting, some of the actors apparently phoned in their performances while others decided to take up the slack. The resultant scenery chewing is uneven, but never boring. The dialogue, not to put too fine a point on it, is absurd and sometimes unintentionally, howlingly funny.The makers of this film are clearly fans of the genre. The subject matter is treated with a loving sledgehammer. As the film progressed my companion and I made a game of naming all the classics represented. In addition to those you might expect, we were able to recognize allusions to `Young Frankenstein,\\' `Star Wars,\\' `Aliens,\\' `Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\' `Gremlins,\\' `Romancing the Stone,\\' `Lord of the Rings,\\' `Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\' `Twister,\\' \"Wild, Wild West\" and any James Bond film you care to name among others. If you go, try it yourself.If the producers were intending to frighten us, they failed dismally; but if they only intended to entertain us they succeeded, if not brilliantly, at least admirably. I\\'m uncertain if they intended quite so much humor, but both my companion and I laughed out loud most of the way through.In addition to inside jokes, the film is filled with extraordinary visual images. From the opening encounter between VH and a startlingly oversized and athletic Edward Hyde, physicality is the order of the day. Everyone, including Van Helsing\\'s friar sidekick is a magnificent specimen. Even Frankenstein\\'s monster (who I nicknamed `Sparky\\' for the electrical discharges from his partially exposed brain) is hideously beautiful. Also, the cinematography is breathtaking. Both real scenery and CGI imagined are dazzling. I especially loved the castles Dracula and Frankenstein. Both edifices were Mad Ludwig\\'s Neuschwanstein Castle as imagined by Tim Burton. I\\'d almost say that if the film had no other virtues at all, it would still be worth the price of admission for the incredible beauty of its backgrounds. However, the real star of the film is the (you guessed it) special effects.Transformation scenes abound. At any point in the film you are only moments from watching someone turn into something. And what wonderful things they are. Vampires don\\'t become simple bats, but snake-jawed, full size harpies. The Wolf man sprouts saber tooth fangs as he rips the human skin from his body. Frankenstein\\'s monster\\'s flesh partially peels from his skull and is smoothly pushed back into place and Mr. Hyde morphs from grinning giant menace to pitiful human corpse.Not to put too fine a point on it, everyone-vampires, villagers, heroes, even horses and cattle go airborne sometime during the film. Dracula\\'s three brides take the prize for most hang time. These ladies would be a wonderful asset to the Transylvanian Air Force with their dizzying dives, spins and barrel rolls. The camera gives us a bat\\'s eye view of their deadly aerobatic ballet. When not in full flight Dracula and his wives walk up walls, across ceilings and carry on family quarrels while hanging from the rafters by their toes. Those characters that do not fly on their own power are lifted aloft and usually dropped soon after. The rest are climbers, scrambling up and down castle architecture like houseflies on speed. Interestingly, no one is ever seriously hurt or even has a hairstyle mussed.The scenes shift so rapidly that it becomes difficult at times to follow the story. Fortunately, the gossamer plot is as deep as a kiddie\\'s backyard swimming pool, so it isn\\'t too much of a problem. Only the barest bones are needed to carry us from one action sequence to the next. Although there is no nudity and not a cussword is uttered, the film is violent. Well, of course it\\'s violent--and about as traumatic as a Road Runner cartoon. Still, it earns its PG-13 rating. Leave the little \\'uns home. The throbbing, pounding soundtrack keeps the attention even when not very much is happening.Is Van Helsing a great film? No. Absolutely not. Is it a good film? No, not really. Is it entertaining? Yes. And maybe, just maybe, that\\'s enough.',\n",
       " 'Universal\\'s greatest monsters are back, this time in a monster mash unlike any other. Stephen Sommers, director of \"The Mummy\", brings a new set of rules and updates to his creatures and makes Van Helsing an awesome, well-equipped action hero. So let\\'s spread our wings, charge up, and take a bite into this action-packed creature feature.Plot: Dracula, the Prince of Darkness, had Dr. Frankenstein create his monster for a nefarious purpose, but the vampire lord loses both the good doctor and his creation. A year later, having finished business in Paris (Mr. Hyde), monster hunter Van Helsing, alongside his genius sidekick Carl, is sent by the Knights of the Holy Order to Transylvania to kill Dracula while protecting Princess Anna from him. However, Dracula has three brides, a werewolf, and other creatures under his control. With the help of Carl, Anna, and Frankenstein\\'s monster, Van Helsing sets out to stop this monster madness with an arsenal of crazy weapons and an attitude to match.This is a great tribute to the classic monster movies. Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein\\'s monster have great updates, cool designs, and unique twists to their characters. Van Helsing is tough as nails and Anna is both sexy and strong. Both characters do have soft spots, especially for each other. Carl, along with many other things in this movie, is pretty darn funny. It\\'s great the way all these characters are tied together in this crazy battle for the fate of the world.With a complex story, nice effects, fun music, good comedy, and awesome action scenes, this movie is sure to please. A must-see film. Check it out. Be sure to bring stakes, crosses, silver bullets, and fire.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve seen some comments on this film suggesting that it has been misunderstood because, really, it\\'s just a camp, cult film. The problem I have with it, is that if that was the intention, it fails because it\\'s just not camp enough, and if that wasn\\'t the intention, it fails because it\\'s dire. Camp dire is fine. Just plain dire isn\\'t. If I was Bram Stoker, I\\'d be suing from beyond the grave.Now I loved director Stephen Sommers \"Mummy\" movies, especially the first one, which was lots of fun, I really like fine actors Hugh Jackman, Richard Roxburgh (wonderfully camp in Moulin Rouge) and David Wenham and I was fairly open minded about Kate Beckinsale as I\\'d hardly seen her in anything before, so I sat down to watch this movie (on pay per view at home) perfectly willing to be entertained. I rarely watch a movie about which I can find nothing good to say, but this was one of those rarities. From the incoherent script, to the confused plot, to the ear splitting sound track, to the overuse and abuse of CGI, to the tacky Brides of Frankenstein (or whatever those girlies were supposed to be. When it comes to scantily clad women, erotic is good, tacky isn\\'t), to Kate Beckinsale\\'s silly costume, to the revolting peasants, the entire thing was such a mess. I think it just proves again that the quality of a movie bears little relation to how much money you throw at it, and that there is really no substitute for a decent script.I\\'m not averse to special effects movies. Try and imagine films like, say, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, or Star Trek: First Contact or last year\\'s War of the Worlds, without special effects. Doesn\\'t really work, does it? And those are all movies I loved, because the effects are used to enhance the story, to tell it better. But what you have at the core of those films, is a good exciting story, well written, and with characters you care about.Who cares about any of these guys? Van Helsing fails mostly because it substitutes special effects for character and story, and then tries to take itself seriously. It\\'s quite a cynical film, hoping to find an audience dumb enough to lap it up.I\\'m still trying to imagine what good actors like Jackman and Wenham were doing in this? Maybe it was one of those movies that\\'s much more fun to make than to watch, I\\'m sure they had a blast in Prague, or where ever it was, and earned enough to pay the mortgage for a few months. I\\'m also well aware that as a middle aged woman I\\'m probably not the target audience for Van Helsing. So it really only remains to say that I sat down to watch it with my two teenage kids, one of each sex. They hated it too, and gave up watching long before I did. When a movie is so bad that my teenage son would rather do his homework than watch - that\\'s bad!',\n",
       " \"I'll begin with the good things about the movie. ... ...Okay now to the bad. Where could i begin? You have a movie with three of the greatest monsters ever created and things some how go horribly wrong. If i may for a moment say that this movie should've been Castlevania the movie but i'm extremely glad it wasn't as it would've been an insult to the series of video games which had deeper, stronger plots than this thing. Its obnoxiously loud, makes no effort for a little character development and makes some horrible use of the aforementioned monsters, including some sorry excuses for CG. Luckily for Mr. Jackman that he has the XMen franchise to live off of and lucky for Kate Beckinsale that she is a hottie because neither of these two have offered much of anything else in any of their other movies and offer even less in this one(what is up with that accent Kate?). Van Helsing makes quick work of getting its characters into situations where they look cool and say cool things. Unfortunately they end up not looking so cool and saying things that are irritating. Its as if the characters know they are in a movie and know that they can't be stopped because the script says so!I'll finish off with this last thing. I subject myself to all kinds of movies. I enjoy great, timeless dramas as much as do dumb summer fair so its not as if i'm a pretentious film student who can't turn off the brain and enjoy some eye candy. There is room for all kinds of films in my mind and neither is more or less important. Anywho, I DO NOT walk out of a movie for any reason, not even to pee. I'm there, i'm giving two hours of my time for the movie. This is my philosophy and for 20 plus years of movie watching i've NEVER once walked out. For Van Helsing i not only took a trip to the bathroom but i went for a cigarette too! I could care less about what was happening which is a sign that not one character was interesting. Not one character seemed genuine nor interesting. So welcome in the summer crop of Hollywood crap with open arms and blank stares, its going to be one long summer movie season!\",\n",
       " \"... and I qualify that because of course there are worse films out there, but they were often made by poverty row studios with no budget. Universal Studios is not poverty row.Why did I give it three stars? Because effects and cinematography have to count for something, and that this film has in spades. But in the plot and direction departments, this thing is one ugly mess. Van Helsing is the legendary vampire hunter, often ably played by Peter Cushing over at Hammer studios back in the 50s and 60s. Here you have another fine actor, underrated Hugh Jackman, playing Van Helsing, but you'd never get that by what goes on here.So Universal drags out every legendary horror character in their catalog - not just Dracula, who actually IS a vampire. They manage to incorporate the Frankenstein monster and The Werewolf too. Bring in the mummy, the invisible man, and the creature from the black lagoon and the gang would all be here. There really is no plot to speak of, just lots of flying female vamps so you can get some gratuitous nudity in, and then there is a plot line installed to lampoon Jackman's role as Wolverine over at Marvel.The bottom line - there must be something better you can do with your time. If not, then you need either a hobby or a job.\",\n",
       " \"Before going to the cinema to see «The Next Level» of Jumanji, I rewatched the first movie, just to refresh my memory. And after watching the new one, I must say - it wasn't underwhelming at all!In addition to what the first film brought, new «Jumanji» has:\\nmore jokes;a whole lot of new characters;a fresh look at the existing characters;plenty of new locations and thus, much more adventures;an absolute muddle of what's happening on the screen;and yes, even more jokes!Given the above, it's time to wrap it up - «Jumanji: The Next Level» is a solid following of a 2017's movie. It's all about laughter, fun, amusement and adventures, of course. In case if you seen «Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle» and enjoyed it, the new «Next Level» won't let you down.\",\n",
       " 'Mild, mild spoilers ahead....I was scared they\\'d somehow screw up the sequel to the \"reboot\" they did, but I was greatly surprise at the new elements they added: the grandpa\\'s subplot and the way it was executed and their contribution to the jumanji gaming experience (they were both hilarious); and all the new additions felt exactly how a sequel to a 90s sequel game would feel like: new abilities and weapons and scenery (or the would-be \"levels\" of the game) they still felt like they\\'d actually be levels of a game! It\\'s exactly what I hoped they\\'d add on because that\\'s the kind of thing the first movie did, it tried to work with the stereotypes and elements found in those good old adventure games like Tomb Raider.I also liked that they brought back the WHOLE gang, the reason why movies like this where the most logical thing would be to make it anthologic, that is, with different kids experiencing the game; so when they try to use the same characters that supposedly learned something from their past experience in it, is a recipe for disaster because it\\'s hard to bring all the gang together without it being forced. But i liked the way they did it, it felt controlled and fulfilling in the end.In conclusion, it was a funny, entertaining and creative action adventure movie, it\\'s not gonna win any Oscars but it\\'s so wrll thought of that it\\'s a delight to watch and I feel it never grows old, you can rewatch it and enjoy it all over again',\n",
       " \"To be honest, I don't have high expectation for the sequel but turns out it is exceeded all of my expectations.Jumanji: The Next Level added new character, skills, and jokes for all of us. I could hear the audiences in the cinema laugh on the jokes and enjoy it as much as my boyfriend and I enjoyed it. Yeah, I have to admit there were some repeated patterns from the first one but along the way they also added several stuffs which brought fresh air to the whole movie.Also, I think the sequel conveyed deeper messages than the first one, potrayed by the characters problem in it, in which we can related to our real life. Lesson I got from this sequel: Sometimes you will hit the end but it doesn't mean it is over. It means, all you have to do is living the present and look it with different perspectives.From the plot of the story, it kinds of light and predictable, but hey, it is a decent sequel you can enjoy with your family.

       " \"Even though its central concept seems ever-so-slightly more strained this time, 'Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)' is about as good as its predecessor. In fact, it's sometimes even better. Basically, the flick is just fun. The crowd-pleasing body-swapping is amped up to eleven, shaking things up just enough so that they feel fresh. The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time. The picture is often funny - though, never hilarious - and is oddly endearing, to boot. It isn't particularly deep or, even, memorable but it doesn't need to be. It's a good time at the movies; what more do you need? Obviously some better theming and, perhaps, a tad of nuance wouldn't go amiss, but it's just not that kind of film really and that's perfectly fine. Even if it doesn't impact you as much as some of the year's best, it'll certainly make you smile and keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Besides, its inciting incident is driven purely by character and it even manages to squeeze some genuine emotional connection, via a well-drawn dynamic between DeVito and Glover, into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings. Its acting is also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic, fully immersing you in the idea that these major stars are actually four teenagers and two old men. Basically, it's not as simple as you might think. 7/10\",\n",

Won\\'t say who it was, but if you\\'re older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, it\\'s entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good.

       " \"ALIAS is the drama series I could never decide whether to be loved or hated. Probably one the most entertaining shows I've ever seen on TV, but also one of the biggest disappointments in my life. Now, how comes that? Arguably, Alias is a great example on how to ruin a drama show that started out with such a great potential. Not with a ground-breakingly original idea (the show obviously resembles La Femme Fatale Nikita and dozens of similar espionage stories), but with its interesting characters and slightly unrealistic but rather clever story lines and plot twists, it DOES manage to get you hooked, after just a few episodes (provided you get to see the right episodes). It sounds good so far, so what the hell went wrong?Well, during its 5-years run, nearly everything. Too bad Alias never managed to become a mainstream show, somehow it always remained kind of underground, a cult show, having said that its ratings never were what network executives expected. Which, despite the initial hype around the show, really was a shame. That was why the network finally decided to tamper with Alias, and the results were somewhat mixed. So it wasn't long before the show started to lose its fanbase, its core audience, and since the show never had sky-high ratings, I consider losing its fanbase... well, the obvious downhill of Alias. For me, it definitely was season four, when ABC had an attempt to introduce Alias to a larger audience, so they had JJ Abrams reboot the show, yet again. Nothing wrong with that... except it went horribly wrong, in my opinion. ABC's idiotic mandates such as avoiding any potentially great long-term plot or mystery (including Rambaldi) made the show so simplistic, so dumbed down, that you might as well have watched any other drama series involving dumb CIA agents fighting dumb terrorist organizations. Gone are the plot twists, the interesting story lines, even the cliffhangers, Alias had lost nearly all of its elements that kept us watching it week to week, only to introduce awfully uninteresting, clichéd stand-alone episodes and dumb criminals that no-one ever cared about. Only when the fourth season came to an end, it was terribly disappointing too. The writers' attempts to make up for the boredom in the first half of the season were absolutely ridiculous, and I just couldn't believe why the same producers that banned Alias from being intelligent and creative (not to mention the Rambaldi storyline) let the season's (and apparently the Rambaldi storyline's) conclusion turn into something that resembles some low-budget 70's horror flick. Undoubtedly that was when I realised that Alias had turned into something it was never supposed to be, and I was praying that the fifth season would somehow make up for the disappointment of the fourth.Sadly, it didn't. Banning Rambaldi again for about the half of season five (but at least not being so desperate about the self-contained format as in season 4), the network clearly had no idea about what they were doing and how much harm their tampering would cause to the show. However, it quickly became clear that Alias would be cancelled, so all we could expect that all the story lines and mysteries would finally be resolved. We also hoped that it would go out with a bang - with the same bang it was introduced to us. But every now and then, we were let down. Really let down.Most of the blame should fall on ABC, for constantly dumbing down Alias and turning it into something it was never supposed to be, and JJ Abrams, who had abandoned the show and moved on to Lost, leaving his own 'child' for the dead (which you might consider a successful move if you are a Lost fan, but otherwise you might as well hate Abrams forever). They should have asked themselves the question: is Alias exactly the same great, intelligent, exciting, suspenseful drama that the audience came to know in its first season? And if there's even a slight possibility that the answer would be 'No'... then clearly, something has gone wrong. Horribly wrong. And it needs fixing. That is what the creators of Alias, along with the network, always failed to do. And this is what led to the ultimate destruction of a once-great TV show. So to answer my initial question: the show is to be loved, and the creators are to be hated for killing it.(Let's be a little bit rude with the rating. The first 2 seasons were near-perfect, the third was a so-so, the last 2 were utter crap. Golden mean it is, I give Alias 5 stars.)\",\n",

Well that's a great way to win a war! How about carrying a weapon? Say a silenced usp? How about shooting you enemies so they can't return in another episode?COME ON GIVE THE GIRL A GUN!!!Example: She's chasing that other female agent that is about to climb up a ladder and get away on the roof and she asks her partner for his gun and then proceeds to shoot the other agent in the shoulder so she drops the bag! Come on she should have hunted her down and executed her, it would be far more realistic.Example2: She was just in Moroco or whatever and she was spotted and the bad guys then shoot one of the people who she was workign with. What does her partner do? Starts beating them up instead of reaching for his gun?!?! Doesn't make sense.Infact this series doesn't make sense. People are comparing it to 24, La Femme Nikita, X-Files, SG-1, Buffy and even James Bond. No it's like a mix between A-Team, Melrose Place and Dark Angel only taking the worst parts from those series.The only fun thing is the guy who provides her with spy gear.\",\n",
       " \"It's fair to say that Baywatch was never a great television show. Sure, it was popular but for reasons very different to it actually being a quality show. It was trashy as hell and combined slow-motion with a number of scantily clad supermodels running down the beach in bathing suits so no surprises at all that it attracted viewers. There seems to be a bit of a trend in reviving franchises that were popular back in the 80s and 90s, and right now, it was the turn of Baywatch. Quite why is something that I'm still scratching my head about.When Mitch Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) butts heads with new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron) over how to run Baywatch, they uncover a local criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay. As soon as the film started and we see Dwayne Johnson saving someone before Baywatch rises from the sea in giant letters behind him, I immediately thought this was going to be exactly what a Baywatch film should be if it was to be successful. A self aware comedy made as a parody of the show, in the same way that made the Jump Street films such a critical and financial success.We get flashes of that formula however, for the most part, Baywatch is just an awful film. Painfully unfunny and not one memorable action sequence means it utterly fails as the action comedy it set out to be, and with a runtime of two hours it becomes one hell of a slog to sit through. I tried to enjoy it and take it for what it is but the problem is I just can't do that when there seems to be no effort into making the film funny, particularly when watching a comedy. Literally every other joke is a dick joke, including an overly long joke about one of the new recruits getting their dick stuck in a deck chair. I knew it was going to be silly and I didn't have high expectations at all but sadly they weren't even met.Coming to the performances, Baywatch is absolutely lifeless. Even Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron, who has shown good comedic timing before, can't save this from becoming the absolute car wreck that it is. Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera are sure nice to look at but the film fails them totally in giving them anything interesting to do, Daddario in particular who is actually quite a talented actress. Then there is Jon Bass who delivers an irritant of a performance as he hopelessly lusts after Rohrbach's CJ Parker. I felt embarrassed for them as they had to perform such a terrible script.I won't even waste time in talking about the pathetic cameo that David Hasselhoff makes in the film. All I will say is what a waste of a cameo that had much better potential if they'd actually stopped to think about it. So there you have it, Baywatch is an awful film that fails as both an action and a comedy. It's already one of the worst films I've seen this year and I won't be surprised if it's still up there come the year's end.\",\n",

There are lots of nice jokes and contrary to my initial thoughts, there are very few nude scenes. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Effron are both great leads and they inarguably take part in all the funny scenes of the movie. I have to admit that I was quite cautious before going to see the movie due to all the negative reviews and I finally came to a conclusion about all the people who believe that every movie should be reviewed as a potential Oscar nominee! Not all movies have to be \"serious\" and dramatic. I know most of the reviewers out there were expecting to see something like \"The Pianist\" when they bought tickets for \"Baywatch\" and that is the reason why this movie let them down. My advice is to watch movies that make you have a nice time (Baywatch is one of them alongside Piranha 3D, American Pie). Not all movies are filmed in order to become Oscar Nominees! Many of them are made with the goal of making the viewers have a great time! Please take that into account the next time you are criticizing a movie!',\n",

Priyanka Chopra does not quite hit the mark as the gorgeous villain who is buying up beachfront and running a drug empire. Still, the cast appear to have had great fun and good chemistry in the filming of this movie. The theatre I attended was full and there was plenty of spontaneous laughing throughout. I love this kind of humour, no it\\'s not high brow and the plot has holes but it\\'s so much fun to watch. Recommend!',\n",
       " \"I am forty-six years old and I'll be one of the first decry Hollywood's descent into 'nothing but potty humor' notions of what passes for comedy these days. Also, having been seventeen when the show first aired I can tell you that the gratuitous shots of bouncing breasts in slow motion we're not nearly as prevalent as people remember, in what little I saw of it. That said, I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews and poor opening of this film! I can't help but wonder what in the world people were expecting. To be fair, I may have watched about five episodes of the TV show when it was on, but my assumption was that the show was about a group of lifeguards getting into situations and capers well outside the purview of a group of lifeguards. For me, this movie was practically perfect at being what it set out to be. It never tried to take itself too seriously, yet was only just campy enough to let the audience know that. I thought everyone performed well in their given roles, the jokes were hilarious and no more excessive than what I would expect the 2017, rated 'R' film version to pull off. At times I even felt like I was in the middle of a seasons long binge on Netflix. This movie did a decent job of making the outlandish 'not-so-mysterious mystery' somewhat believable and I even half-expected a scene near the end with Priyanka Chopra's villain saying, 'And I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling lifeguards and your bigger, stronger Hasselhoff!' Now as a disclaimer, this was the first 'R' rated movie I took my teen-aged son to see so I thought perhaps my laugh meter was ratcheted up, but the theater that was 85% full at 9:20PM on a Sunday night all seemed to be laughing as hard as we were. I think perhaps people were just upset with this film for having not enough naked women and sexual situations, or contrarily didn't want their Baywatchers using foul language and making penis jokes? I don't know. I say go see this movie with zero expectations, let it be what it is, don't be a prude, and you will laugh a lot and have a good time!\",\n",
       " 'Fun fact: The original TV show \"Baywatch\" was cancelled after only one season. True story. Ratings for NBC\\'s skin-tastic lifeguards-save-L.A. action-drama placed it in 73rd place out of 103 shows for the 1989-1990 television season\\x85 and its studio (GTG) went out of business. But, as Norm McDonald used to remind us from the desk of SNL\\'s Weekend Update, \"Germans LOVE David Hasselhoff.\" (And people in lots of other countries do too!) Keeping the show from becoming a footnote in TV history, series star David Hasselhoff brought it to first-run syndication, where it ran from 1991-1999. Having become an international sensation, it then continued in a new setting, with a mostly new cast and under a new name, \"Baywatch Hawaii\", for two more seasons. Along the way, the show became a major part of the careers of Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, Yasmine Bleeth, Carmen Electra, Brooke Burns, Parker Stevenson and many others. Given the show\\'s small screen stamina and enduring popularity, it seems natural that the TV show \"Baywatch\" would eventually become the movie \"Baywatch\" (R, 1:56), much like \"CHiPs\" earlier in 2017. Unfortunately, much like \"CHiPs\", the big screen \"Baywatch\" sucks.On a Florida beach, Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) leads a group of lifeguards that he calls \"the elite of the elite\". Mitch himself has over 500 water rescues under his\\x85 trunks, while teammates Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera) and C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) are similarly brave and skilled. In order to expand their team, Mitch and company hold try-outs for an additional three lifeguard slots. The new trainees end up being: the beautiful and brainy Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario), an awkward, out-of-shape but hard-charging nerd named Ronnie (Jon Bass) and Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a cocky, selfish 2-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming, who has since become persona non grata in the swimming world – and in society. (His new job somehow counts as community service for unspecified legal trouble.) As Ronnie harbors a not-so-secret crush on C.J., and Brody flirts with Summer, training commences. Brody has to learn what it is to be a real team player and that there is more to being a lifeguard than just being able to swim fast. Meanwhile, a local police officer (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), Mitch\\'s supervisor (Rob Huebel), and even Brody, want Mitch to learn that he is a lifeguard – NOT a cop.The reason that Mitch and the other lifeguards feel the need to act like cops is found in the person of Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra from TV\\'s \"Quantico\"). She\\'s the new owner of a bayside resort called The Huntley Club and it looks like she\\'s up to no good. We hear her accused of running drugs\\x85 and she doesn\\'t deny it. We see her colluding with a city councilman (Oscar Nuñez) on some real estate deal\\x85 and see bribes him with an expensive watch. We understand that Mitch doesn\\'t trust her\\x85 and she invites him to a party. At this \"meet the neighbors\" gathering, Mitch and company do their best to dig up some dirt to back up their suspicions, but Leeds is a wily woman and proof is harder to find than body fat on Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron. When packets of a dangerous designer drug pop up, plus a suspicious fire and a couple of corpses, naturally it\\'s up to a few lifeguards to solve the mystery, right? That\\'s what the Baywatch babes and boys think anyway. And that\\'s just part of what\\'s wrong here.\"Baywatch\" is mostly ridiculous and unfunny. What passes for character development are back stories which raise more questions than they answer. What passes for acting are one-dimensional characterizations which aren\\'t believable or even sensical. And what passes for humor basically falls into one of three categories: references to the areas of the human body usually covered by swim suits, vomit jokes and seeing how many pop culture references Mitch can come up with to insult young pretty boy Brody (although some were funny) – and the best gags are all in the theatrical trailers. The screenplay, by writing partners Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, puts the characters in situations which are more insulting to the intelligence of the average Movie Fan than they are humorous. Seth Gordon\\'s direction is too weak to make sense of it all or to give the audience more than a few chuckles along the way.The acting is across-the-board bad, but the worst of the worst is a tie between Bass, for simply doing a 2-hour Josh Gad impression, and Chopra, for showing nowhere near the gravitas or menace necessary to be an effective villain\\x85 with a (dis)honorable mention to the usually entertaining Johnson, who ends up in his worst role since 2013\\'s \"Pain & Gain\". For a few amusing moments and for poking self-aware fun at its source material, the film scores minor points, but it basically can\\'t decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a parody or a drama and it doesn\\'t do any of those very well. (But don\\'t gloat Dax Shepherd. \"CHiPs\" made most of the same mistakes.) \"Baywatch\" would be better titled \"No Way Watch\". This movie is as lame as that pun I just made. In a mid-credits scene, Johnson talks sequel with a cast member from the original TV show. Don\\'t hold your breath, Dwayne. Consider your movie fortunate to get out of this review with a \"D+\".',\n",
       " 'Comedy is dead. Baywatch has made me lose any hope of any movie being funny in 2017. If this is the best Hollywood can do, they are done for.There is no inspiration or creativity to be found. The idea is: Hey, 21 Jump Street was hilarious! What would happen if we did the same thing for (fill in the blank)? 21 Jump Street was one of the rare occasions where a TV-adaptation film was worth seeing, and ultimately, ended up being better than the source material. What was Baywatch originally? A horrible TV show in the 80\\'s. It existed only to show off the glistening, bouncing, beautiful bodies of it\\'s lead actors David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. There isn\\'t much material to make a film off of. That is, unless, the filmmakers went nuts and turned the source material into an absurd farce.. lets say of the Will Ferrel variety. Instead, Baywatch 2017 is a lopsided, painfully stupid, unbearably dull, cringe- inducing insult to the intelligence of the filmgoing public. Pain and Gain had more nuanced humor. Mike and Dave was the funnier Zac Efron movie. Let that sink it.I might have said, \"This makes no sense\", out-loud in the movie theater about 10 times. They made a film completely out of action-comedy clichés, strung together incoherently. The big laugh set- pieces are desperate. One joke in particular is a genital mishap lifted directly from \"There\\'s Something About Mary\". That joke is 20-years old. If you\\'re going to be a thief, at least steal something timely. The cast might be the only positive thing I can note. They are all really charming, and sexy to look at, but at what cost?I couldn\\'t think of a worse film to be slated for Memorial Day weekend. This is going to be a long, hot summer of Hollywood failures.',\n",
       " 'It\\'s a warm, beautiful day on the beach. The pristine waves crash gently against the sand as the sun-kissed folk of Southern Florida come out to play. Lifeguard Post 1 stands like a sentinel - its windows permanently cocked forward towards the horizon. There\\'s a change in the wind. A wind surfer looses control of his sail and is catapulted upward towards the sky before plummeting, head first into a coral reef. He\\'s knocked unconscious...all seems lost. Then Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) appears on the scene.What results is a valiant rescue that inexplicably involves slow-motion running, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson flexing his pectorals underwater, fireworks and dolphins for some reason. The movie could have stopped right there as by that point we got the best version of what could have been the cinematic version of a far-fetched TV show. Unfortunately the first fifteen minutes aren\\'t so much a harbinger of the hilarity to come but rather a visual metaphor for the movie\\'s inflated sense of self.The film energetically sets up its main characters with all-too-brief introductions on tryout day. We immediately endear ourselves veterans Stephanie (Hadera), C.J. (Rohrbach) and Mitch as they judge incoming trainees the tough and brainy Summer (Daddario), the dorky Ronnie (Bass) and disgraced former Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (Efron) whose ego Mitch sees as a liability. Much of the film\\'s prouder moments are spent with The Rock and Efron doing what they do best; The Rock deflating Brody\\'s ego with real-deal charisma and action hero one-liners - Efron playing the dim-witted, put-upon jock who deserves everything he has coming to him because he was in High School Musical (2006).But just when you think everything will turn out for this movie, the narrative drastically shifts to a crime story that stops the movie\\'s momentum cold. The narrative thrust involves the new owner of the beach\\'s fancy yacht club (Chopra) and her suspicious connection to a new designer drug called Flaka. The rest of the movie doesn\\'t so much spend time exploring that connection or its implications (Chopra compares herself favorably to a Bond villain pretty much from the get go) but instead it lays every aspect of the conspiracy out on the table and waits for the lifeguards to connect the dots.This ploy not only doesn\\'t work but it basically splits Baywatch into two completely unsatisfying pieces. The first piece brings a diversity of comic set-pieces which on their own, probably couldn\\'t make a good sketch on Key and Peele (2012-2015). They lack a depth of character requiring one or two of them to be more gullible, less resourceful or otherwise dumber than what was previously established.The other half of the movie plants its flag firmly on The Rock\\'s ability to recap what we already know while Priyanka Chopra chews unhelpfully on the scenery until the timer runs out. All throughout the film drops hints that you should care about this or that - an insert shot of a watch brings more pause than a fiery boat rescue. Yet because nothing new is ever revealed, the film\\'s call for attention becomes soporifically annoying.The overall tone of the film is also aggressively reductive, treating the, in retrospect quaint misogyny of the original series with an uncomfortable amount of contrarian glee. Every time one of the girls of Baywatch justifiably call out the boys for being pervs, the payoff by the end of the film amounts to nothing more than quid pro quo ribbing or worse - they end up with the dude at the end. If Baywatch had just treated the subject as window-dressing, I might have been inclined to let it go (after all trash TV is trash TV). Unfortunately the movie stops just short of waving its d**k in the air while saying \"you think we\\'re being sexist, f**k you bruh!\" Thus I think its worth a brief mention.Baywatch has all the necessary ingredients to make a pretty satisfying comedic soup. Unfortunately apart from The Rock and Efron standing out as the film\\'s sole saving graces, everything else is squandered on a useless story, oblivious editing and a unifying tone that\\'s unnecessarily combative. Unless you\\'re the type of person who truly believes Kelly Rohrbach\\'s slo-mo runs along the beach are enough to maintain your attention, I suggest skipping out on this aggressively unfunny movie.On a related note: Stop with the dorky guy gets the hot girl for doing nothing cliché. It\\'s been done a hundred times before, you\\'re bringing nothing new to the table and it\\'s come to the point where if you do it at all it just feels icky. The Sam Witwickys of the the world should have to, you know, work for it now.',\n",
       " \"AntMan is a lesser know character of marvels but by no means does that effect the quality of this movie. First off I thought that the casting of this film wasn't going to work, that been Paul Rudd mainly, just because I have read a few of the AntMan comics and didn't think it was going to work, I was wrong he is brilliant, hilarious and believable, all of the jokes he made actually made laugh out load which doesn't happen much. Michael Pena was great in this film, he plays the same kind of character he always seems too, but it really works, especially the story telling scenes were hilarious. This was a all round well cast film.The action and CGI Was great, on first thoughts I thought when AntMan shrinks down that the CGI would take you out of the movie but let me tell you it doesn't, it's awesome! Especially seeing the world from that size and scenes where AntMan is shrinking and enlarging when fighting i thought would get a little too much but the honestly don't.All around I AntMan felt different to all the other MCU movies that have come out, but a good different.\\xa0 \\xa0 A well cast,directed and acted film that will be a welcome addition to my marvel collection.\",\n",
       " 'OK, so I will probably target the wrath of a legion of fan-boys but as a PhD Physicist I will categorically state that much of the science in the Marvel universe is total nonsense. For example, it requires a certain suspension of belief that whole cities can be levitated. But it\\'s called \"Science Fiction\" for a reason, right? \"Ant Man\" pushes that suspension of belief to whole new levels. The concept that a miniaturised man, were such a thing even possible, could exert the same moment and force as a full sized person would make Newton spin in his grave.With these nagging doubts I watched the trailer increasingly comfortable in my view that, (even with a free cinema pass), this was a film I would avoid like the plague. That was until the final scene, featuring Thomas the Tank engine, that was ludicrously and surprisingly comical. Could it be that, like last year\\'s \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", Marvel had pulled its pompous head out of its ass and come up with an \\'Avengers-lite\\' that could entertain a broader audience? I decided to risk it. And I was glad I did.Paul Rudd (\"Friends\", \"Anchorman\") plays ex-con Scott Lang who is recruited by brilliant scientist and would-be superhero Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his gorgeous daughter Hope (\"Lost\" and \"The Hobbit\"\\'s Evangeline Lilly) to steal a jacket. (No, really). The owner of said jacket, albeit a high-tech jacket, is businessman and all-round bad-guy Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), with evil intent. (You can tell he\\'s evil by what he does to a cute little lamb - this is the worst viewing for sheep since \"Far from the Madding Crowd\".) By miniaturising Lang and securing the help of an army of ants, the stage is set for a heist of a most unusual kind.This sounds ridiculous to even write. So why does it work? First up, the script by Edgar Wright ( of \"3 Flavours Cornetto\" fame), Adam McKay (\"The Other Guys\"), Joe Cornish and Paul Rudd himself is as tight as a drum, with some situations and lines that are downright hilarious. A couple of brilliant lip sync scenes, one featuring the requisite Stan Lee cameo, are grin-inducing pleasures.Supporting the screenplay, the three leading players pull off their roles with enormous panache. Rudd is hugely likable, with all of the smart-whip humour of Downey Jnr.\\'s \"Iron Man\" but with none of the appalling arrogance. Michael Douglas, in his one outing this year, seems to be revelling in his role and (presumably with the help of some clever makeup and/or CGI) looking very dapper in the 1987 version of his character. And Evangeline Lilly enters the Avenger\\'s world with a bang and looks very comfortable there. In an effective supporting role, Michael Peña (\"American Hustle\") adds a comic lightness of touch as fellow robber Luis. Abby Ryder Fortson also deserves special mention (and an Oscar for cuteness) as Lang\\'s young daughter.Whilst real fan-boys might object to the flippant nature of the film, there are a number of clever cross-overs into the \\'mainstream\\' \"Avengers\" films, with one B-list Avenger guest star and (eventually) an A-list appearance. And (as is common in these films, and notable as 80% of the audience stayed in their seats for the full credits) there is both a mid-credits scene (that\\'s a set-up for the sequel) and a final post-credit scene that (so I\\'d told) is hugely significant for next year\\'s \"Captain America: Civil War\" (in which Rudd is set to reprise his \"Ant Man\" role).The director is Peyton Reed, whose limited movie portfolio to date includes Jim Carrey\\'s \"Yes Man\" and \"Bring it On\".As I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience, my rating, against all the odds, is twice what I expected it to be. I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this\\x85 but I recommend you go see this for a fun movie summer experience.',\n",
       " \"Like many people, I came into the theater wondering how Marvel would make the audience care about such a little-known character with decidedly unimpressive powers. It turns out they used the opportunity to make one of their best movies yet.Ant-Man was not at all what I expected. I have been a fan of most of the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic universe, but you don't have to be a fan of super hero movies to enjoy this movie. it has good pacing and holds your interest throughout. There are plenty of action and the fight scenes, but unlike the previous Marvel movies, this movie focuses on a heist. This, along with the comedy throughout, makes it a breath of fresh air in the Marvel universe. No Marvel movie since has so seamlessly bonded the genre of action and comedy. The main character, Scott Lange, is not a billionaire or scientist or ancient god, and he doesn't have super strength or intelligence; he is a thief who deals with holding down a job and being able to see his daughter. This makes him incredibly relatable. Being played by Paul Rudd doesn't hurt either. Rudd, along with the rest of the cast, delivers a memorable performance. The idea of a father trying to reconcile his relationship with his daughter may have been used before, but Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas make it work without seeming trite or overused. The role that really stands out is Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket. He is, in my opinion, the most terrifying villain the Marvel universe has seen yet. He doesn't want global domination, he wants money and power, and that makes him a very believable villain. Stoll's performance is more three-dimensional than one might expect in a super hero movie, and adds to the already great cast.Perhaps the most impressive part of Ant-Man was the visual effects. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D, and the quality was stunning. I don't like most movies in 3D, but this one worked well. The shrinking and growing looked very good as well as the action sequences. Although the action happens on a small scale, it can stand up to any of the other movies Marvel has made. If you haven't seen this film yet, I would highly recommend it. The acting, directing, and cinematography all make this film highly enjoyable, even if you haven't seen any of Marvel's previous films.\",\n",
       " \"For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym – the original Ant-Man in the comic books – to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product – Peyton Reed's Ant-Man – is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.After serving his jail sentence, Scott Lang (Rudd) just wants to reunite with his daughter Cassie and get his life back on track. But he soon discovers that people in the outside world – including his ex- wife Maggie (Greer) and her new cop boyfriend Paxton (Cannavale) – aren't particularly kind to former convicts. Beaten down by circumstances, he agrees to pull off one last heist with his eternally optimistic buddy Luis (Pena). It's a crime that places him squarely in the path of Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas), a retired, semi-reclusive scientist who decides to enlist Scott in his life-long mission of preventing the Pym Particle – a technological breakthrough that allows him to become the super- small, super-strong Ant-Man – from falling into the wrong hands.Truth be told, Ant-Man gets off to a somewhat shaky start. The tale of an honourable rogue who's looking for a shot at redemption is a well-worn storytelling trope, one that the film initially seems to embrace rather too eagerly. As we watch Scott soldier through a host of tiny indignities, the dialogue – still credited to Wright and his co-writer Joe Cornish, with rewrites by Rudd and Adam McKay – is uninspired, and oftentimes uncomfortably on-the-nose. There's no subtlety here, and the sense of fun that accompanies Scott's attempt to hold down a job in Baskin Robbins feels a wee bit forced.But the film kicks into higher gear, and stays there, once Scott stumbles onto or, more accurately, steals his second chance. His discovery of the Ant-Man suit and all that entails – working with Hank, meeting Hank's aloof but eminently capable daughter Hope (Lilly), training to prevent Hank's former protégé Darren Cross (Stoll) from replicating the Pym Particle for sale to the highest bidder – give the story the shot of adrenaline it needs. In the blink of an eye, this superhero heist flick finds its feet, and transforms into a whirlwind of action, humour and heart. Reed's camera zigs merrily from Luis' unique method of exposition (brilliant) to Scott's attempts to survive Hope's training (bruisingly hilarious), before zagging into the dark, trembling heart of Hank's troubled relationship with his daughter.Indeed, what makes Ant-Man work so well is its insistence on respecting its characters and taking their concerns and relationships seriously. This provides the film with an emotional anchor amidst all the madcap chaos and gleeful irreverence. Scott's overpowering love for his young daughter runs parallel to Hank's own concern for Hope, and even Paxton – initially caricaturised as the stereotypical brutish new boyfriend – is given layers and depth beyond what might be expected of a film that seems so silly on the surface. This culminates in the film's best action sequence: one that manages to be utterly ridiculous, as the camera cheekily zooms in and out of a conflict that's entirely proportional to the size of its participants; but also deeply heartfelt, when Scott makes a split-second decision between life and probable death. For anyone concerned about Ant-Man subsisting in its own little bubble within the MCU, rest assured that there's plenty on display here to please even the most die-hard of fans. The film features not only a welcome cameo from a very popular agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but also ties Scott firmly into MCU continuity with a hugely pleasing direct reference to Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between Ant-Man and a certain Avenger proves that this miniscule hero has what it takes to stand proud alongside the world's mightiest champions. (Stay through the credits, by the way, for two incredibly exciting hints at what's to come for the MCU in the future.)As with all the other films and television shows in Marvel's burgeoning media empire, the cast of Ant-Man is pitch-perfect. Rudd puts his goofy and amiably sexy charisma to excellent use as Scott, allowing us to believe that this one man can be as silly as he is strong, and as serious as he is funny. Lilly gets the big-screen role she richly deserves in Hope, who's acknowledged at every point in the film as being better, stronger, and more capable than the men around her think she is. Douglas plays a far more palatable version of Dr. Pym (who can be tough to swallow in the comics), and does so with his trademark charm and magnetism, while Stoll gives good psychopath as the increasingly unhinged, patently cruel Cross.Ant-Man may not edge out the other films that make up Phase Two of the MCU in a straw poll – it does, after all, face some pretty serious competition in what has been an unbroken run of truly excellent superhero films. But it's an incredibly solid effort: smart, rich, deep and funny, teeming with ideas, genres and the potential for so much more. Now if that doesn't make for a great superhero movie, what does?\",\n",
       " \"Had it been too desperate and hopeless, ANT-MAN would have shrunk its way for admission to the almost-complete, Avengers team. But neither such concern nor saving the world from an impending catastrophic destruction, holds weight heavy enough to pull this miniature superhero from his top priority: winning back his daughter. The emotional weight of the narrative comes across as an anomalous content to the generally comedic structure of the film, but they serve purpose for the overall flow of the proceedings, nonetheless.The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), who has just been released from prison after committing burglary. He has been prohibited to see his daughter due to his inability to provide financial support, no thanks to his being an ex-con that keeps hindering him from getting a job. He meets the highly-intellectual yet solitary scientist, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who has a job for him: pulling off a heist on his ex-protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who is in possession of a size-changing prototype, that poses massive amount of threats to worldwide security. Using a military suit that allows him to shrink back and forth, in size, Lang carries on with the mission with the hope that by doing so, he would be able to reclaim and earn the reputation and respect he lost, especially his daughter's.It's easier to see Ant-Man as a beautiful mess, rather than a well-crafted superhero flick with profound depth and sense . There's a lot of illogical nonsense that always nearly sends the film to wreckage, but there's also so much of the fun side to make up for the eventual narrative shortcoming. At the center of its comic efforts, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man shines with his general amiability, pulling off his role with credible wit and comic allure. Rudd is such a delight here, and his presence and effortless take on his character make the mostly messed-up flow of the events, extremely palatable. There's also much to say about Michael Douglas, how his character, Pym, easily integrates well with Lang and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lily) , to provide a firm and well-knitted character framework. Corey Stoll, on the other hand, is less impressive, barely providing the needed threat to make his presence felt and his belligerence imminent. But on moments where he and Lang engage in beautifully-choreographed fight scenes, the ineptitude gets relegated below the more important aspects of the proceedings, and once it does, the breathtaking visual schemes work under the spotlight, capturing Lang's size-changing skill with epic elaborateness. There's magic in every size shift, and the visual artistry is at its peak to deliver the moment.Perhaps, one of the most immediately-noticeable difference of Ant-Man from its Marvel fellows is that it doesn't engage, nor rush too much, to explosive battles that generally results to immeasurable destruction. It is noticeably evident on the fact that its most interesting and most jaw-dropping action setpiece, happens in a toy train set. Most importantly, this new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe places its comic prowess at the center of its general effort to validate its entry to the franchise, and that is achieved without putting the natural action/adventure tendency of its superhero, nor the inevitable emotional nature of its characters, at risk of getting overshadowed by the rudimentary elements of the narrative.It's actually hard to gauge ANT-MAN using the same measure that made the rest of its pack, mammoth and omnipotently powerful. But in its own right, and sub-atomic scale, this microscopic superhero is clearly a power behemoth, and it will surely spring back to its even bigger form, once the Avenger call is delivered.\",\n",
       " 'Undoubtedly, each of us in childhood had favorite superheroes that we admired. They were in demand and needed, because they always taught a good cause: they clearly demonstrated how to be persistent and strong; how to overcome difficulties and obstacles; To reach heights and conquer new horizons; be able to love and offer a helping hand in a difficult moment; and most importantly - to remain yourself, soul and heart. Such acts and good deeds invariably evoked feelings of pride and enthusiasm, and it was so attractive and tempting that they could not help imitating them - fluttering like a smoke out of everyday everyday life and moving towards a huge peace, in the name of his own salvation. Sometimes it happens that patriotism prevails over soulfulness, and after all the lofty and ambitious, at times haughty and arrogant projects about superheroes, I want to take a break, to look at something that is not burdensome, unconstrained, perhaps even modest and simpler, closer to my liking. Following the loud and sensational \"Era of the Altron\", the company Marvel, provides just such an opportunity, providing in his universe a place of an Ant-Man, whose name is not so popular and known as other heroes, but nevertheless, it is needed for the purpose of a full set , and also for the completion of the second phase of this very carnival.The man-ant. In the past, he was Dr. Hank Pym, now - burglar and thief Scott Lang. People do not shout at all, do not shout out his name, they do not sing praises in his honor, but the gifts given by Pim, in particular the reduction in size, clearly stand out Scott on the background of other superheroes, and, of course, find an interesting and fascinating application for themselves. Scott is far from hopeless, like many others, he also has his advantages, in fact skillfully breaks through protective mechanisms. In the same virtuosic way, Marvel draws parallels between the tiny world of the Ant-Man and our ordinary. This is the highlight of the picture, where from a daily routine, such as the running water in the bathroom, the movement of insects, there is a really exciting show that does not get bored, at least because of its novelty and uniqueness. Ants who are a friendly team, attract a lot of attention, manifesting themselves from different sides, and to discover and discover something new and amazing in its own way is always pleasant.\\nWithout opposition and struggle, the whole picture does not lining up, so you need an opponent, who is a pupil of Hank Pym - Darren Kross, nicknamed the Yellow Hornet. And yet, it is worth noting that in the picture of Peyton Reed there are no strictly negative characters, there are only people who have lost their way. As a matter of fact, the Cross is the same, and its motives are clear and common, as well as Lang, Pim and others. If the \"Man-Ant\" and stands out with some ingenuity, then only by that small world, and as to the decoupling of the plot and the characters - they are submitted in the most elementary and uncomplicated manner. Be that as it may, this does not affect the film, which, in addition to its wittyness, wins and due to a good actor\\'s presentation. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, together with their characters perfectly in harmony with each other, do not forget Michael Penny, with his funny character and funny gang, which makes a significant proportion of humor, due to his absurdity and absurdity.If you reproach the \"Person-ant\", then only for the accelerated rhythm of the narrative, leaving in the end a feeling of unfinishedness and haste. Shortened actions and incompletely developed relationships experience the same sense of conciseness as the \"Altron era\", but in this case, based on the above aspect, Peyton Read\\'s film turns out to be more advantageous, perhaps because of the lack of trickery and sophistication . In addition to the fantastic, interesting and without exaggeration of the exciting world, the theme of love and family drama is touched upon. Love between the parent and the child, family ties are not just superficial, or for the species, they occupy an important place in the picture, which also gives an impression of a small share of its dramatic and soulfulness. \"Person-ant\" can be safely called the most real outlet, against the backdrop of great pathos and excessive heroism. The film is light, casual, pleasant, sometimes ironic and funny. He will certainly find his place among other Marvel projects, thereby expanding his cinematic universe even more.',\n",
       " \"Through this masterpiece, on par with, in my humble opinion, all other Marvel movies currently out in the Avengers Saga, obviously including the side series, Marvel has completely blown me away. Character development, solid plot, fantastic humour and amazing cast all done flawlessly and did not leave me hoping for more, but rather asking 'When's the sequel coming out?'With Michael Douglas and Michael Peña, having seen them both in previous movies where their performances are exemplary to say the least, I expect such mastery, but with Paul Rudd, and all the other actors, given this is the first movie in which I ever saw them, I had no idea what to expect. Complete success!The fighting style of Ant-man is was as I expected since I have some background knowledge of the character, and yet I nonetheless could not have dreamt for such a good combination of just-enough special effects and fantastic actor performances! Ant-man is already brilliantly made, and it only gets more so during the combat scenes, for the ability to shrink and grow at will is something with which, to my great delight, Marvel got very creative, not holding back.I'm trying to figure out when I can watch it again.\",\n",
       " 'I think all the people who\\'ve written a negative review of this movie because of its apparent \"scientific contradictions\" are missing the point.How can people who accept a man turning into a green monster or holes opening in the sky and spitting out an army of hover bike-riding space aliens criticise the science in this film? That\\'s probably the worse case of deluded double standards I\\'ve ever witnessed.No, the REAL problem with this movie is just like any other MCU film. The thunderingly dull expository dialogue, the pantomime characters, the cheap cinematography, the flat and stilted performances, the dramatically compromised script and the infantile tone. And the most insulting aspect is that every single one of these cinematic atrocities spends vast amounts of its running time promising us even more of this trash is still to come.The problem with Disney and Marvel and the relentless machine they\\'ve created is that so much money has been made from this dross that actually MAKING A GOOD MOVIE now seems to be nowhere near the top of their agenda. Another $175m gets spent, it opens, pimply faced kids vomit out their cash for a couple of weeks, then it goes to China, makes more, numbers are counted, accountants smile, Disney smiles, rinse and repeat.But nobody\\'s making a good movie. And guess what? The studio doesn\\'t care. THEY DON\\'T NEED TO ANYMORE.It\\'s time to boycott this insanity. Life\\'s too short and there are so many good films out there that won\\'t make you feel like you\\'ve been brain-raped and just lost two perfectly good hours of your life.Disney be warned. Your days of guaranteed return on these turds is imminent.',\n",
       " 'Ant-Man must have been a challenge for these filmmakers. The preceding films from the Avengers Universe featured an epic roster of out-of-this-world heroes whose names alone make you tinkle a little: IRON MAN, THOR, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\\x85 and then there\\'s Ant-Man. (Womp-womp) While die-hard fans of the comics would recognize Ant-Man as an original member of the ensemble, the general audience may be left to wonder WTF?!Ant-Man, do you even lift, Bro?The filmmakers must have been aware of this, considering the tongue-in-cheek treatment of the script. With a screenplay largely penned by Shaun of the Dead legend Edgar Wright, and built upon by other great comedic writers, Joe Cornish (Attack the Bock), Adam McKay (Anchorman), and Ant-Man himself Paul Rudd, Ant-Man does indeed do some heavy lifting, delivering one of the funniest, most entertaining, and visually satisfying superhero movies to date.The ant super-suit is sick. Red and silver with bulging insectoid eyes, it looks like a modern day motocross version of the Japanese monster slayer Ultraman. As soon as he hits the shrink button, you are sucked into a world so awesome you have no choice but to brace yourself and see where the ride takes you. Stan Lee wanted to make this movie in the 80\\'s but ironically Disney, the production company behind today\\'s Ant-Man, already had a shrinking movie of its own in the works. While \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" was amazing in its time, I couldn\\'t be happier that they waited for the movie effects of today to let Ant- Man zip this way and that, from our world to the minuscule one and back. Coincidentally an ant saved the kids from a giant scorpion in that Rick Moranis classic, and in Ant-Man the ants also play a major role in saving the day. That\\'s right. His power is not only to shrink to the size of an ant, but also to control an army of them. In that respect, this movie is unlike any superhero movie you\\'ve ever seen.The Pym Particle, created by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has the ability to shrink a living human being. Think of the possibilities! Microsurgery, mobility, and of course, warfare! The latter makes Dr. Pym realize just how dangerous this technology really is and he decides to cease research and development altogether. Years pass, and the existence of this technology is reduced to a myth. What Dr. Pym didn\\'t know is that his own assistant Darren Cross (Corey Stoll, House of Cards) had been obsessing over this myth and has been trying to replicate this technology on his own. Stoll has a unique ability to make you sympathize for his character at times, but can also be straight up scary.Dr. Pym and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly, Lost) know they have to stop Cross but keep butting heads. Hope is a badass, but Pym refuses to let her get involved, which reveals some deeper, more serious daddy issues. Their only hope is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, my man crush), an ex-convict who was a professional burglar, not a robber because Lang insists that implies physical violence, and he\\'s not about that life. To pull off the job, Lang enlists his original heist crew, played by David Dastmalchian, Rapper T.I., and Michael Peña, who offers some of the most hilarious scenes in the movie. What ensues is an adventure, a comedy, an action movie and a heist rolled into one Little Debbie oatmeal cookie crumb of elephantine excitement and pure elation. If you haven\\'t noticed, I like this movie.Close friends may say I am biased because it stars Paul Rudd, whom I have been enamored with ever since Clueless. When Cher realized she was in love with Josh, I too realized Paul Rudd is my number one man crush. Let me close this by taking a moment to acknowledge how perfect Paul Rudd is in the role of Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He is a master at self-deprecating humor, as seen in movies like \"I Love You, Man\" and \"Knocked Up\" and his role as Mike Hannigan on \"Friends.\" This is a necessity when you see how Ant-Man may have somewhat of a Napoleon Complex when he inevitably has to measure up against the mighty Avengers. Paul Rudd has shown his chops as a dramatic actor in movies like \"The Shape of Things\" and \"Admission,\" and again here in Ant- Man as an estranged father, who wants nothing more than to spend more time with his daughter Cassie. While elements of his various roles can be seen in Ant-Man this was nothing like anything Paul Rudd has ever done before, and he pulled it off.His dedication can be seen not only in the moment that reveals his handsomely chiseled abs. In preparation for the role, Paul Rudd bought an ant farm to study. Even after he finished shooting, he decided to keep it. Just when you thought you couldn\\'t fall in love with Paul Rudd any further. On the week the movie was released, Paul Rudd earned a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and deservedly so. Somehow it\\'s not the star that immortalizes him in film history. It\\'s his stellar performance in Ant-Man, the movie that will shrink and find its way into your heart and stay there forever.',\n",
       " \"Its a shame so much money was spent on so little. I'm not talking about the premise of the movie, a microscopic super hero. No I'm talking about the dismal film, Ant Man, represents. This film, in spite of its budget and reasonable cast, feels a hell of a lot like a badly made B-Grade flick. The kind that goes straight to television. The acting is hammy and melodramatic, the storyline tedious and formulaic and the action badly timed and somehow, rather awkward and clumsy. In fairness, this is not easy subject matter to migrate from comic book to big screen. The notion of a super hero who can shrink in size is a tough one requiring very careful handling and timing. The fact the subject matter is tossed around like a football is the reason its such a mess. My advice, give this one a miss. Two out of ten from me.\",\n",
       " \"Before watching archer I would watch cartoons like Family Guy, American Dad and Futurama. These sort of animated shows are good but old and don't change the formula of a successful show. They are all the same, a family/ group of friends getting into mischief everyday and each day is completely different but with the same people.At first I though Archer was just going to be another comedy cartoon like Family guy. I thought it would be loads of random jokes (not saying random jokes aren't funny but Seth Macfarlane has been doing the same routine over and over) and hardly any story, but I tell you now I was wrong, so terribly wrong.Archer is pure brilliance. It's like James Bond became an abusive alcoholic and that everyone he works with are insane. It looks pretty and is well animated, it's full of funny jokes and most importantly of all it has a story line that runs through out the whole series!I love Archer because it doesn't have a new story every episode and forgetting what happened last time. You get to know the characters and see them develop as episode go on. The show doesn't shy away from changing things up, one minute you think that it's just an ordinary mission and the next minute something massive happens which leads to a character changing and this is who the character will act from now on.The jokes are funny and always make me laugh and sometimes the situations they get in are funny. The character are horrible people, if you met them in really life you would hate them but in the show you can't help but love everyone. The show also introduces loads of new characters that stick around or return every now and again for a episode.I have loved watching every episode and I've just started season 5 which is insane. The best animated TV show I have ever watched! 10/10 Highly recommend watching if you like shows like South park, American Dad, Bobs Burgers, Robot Chicken and Frisky Dingo.\",\n",
       " 'If you want to see the Pacific version of HBO\\'s critically acclaimed \"Band of Brothers\", change the channel\"The Pacific\" differs from \"Band of Brothers\" whereas the \"The Pacific\" focuses on the war itself and \"Band of Brothers\" focused on the characters. Both miniseries are championed by Hollywood heavy-hitters Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who were contributing writers and producers of both miniseries.Perhaps the greatest distinction between the two mini-series was intentional. It is clear that the soldiers in the Pacific theater fought a different kind of war than those fighting in Europe. \"The Pacific\" is a gritty if not gory depiction of a war against not just the Japanese, but also the elements. The cast is made-up of some brilliant actors we are sure to see again in future projects. What makes \"The Pacific\" so good is the intense realism which brings the viewer into the battle from the safety of your couch. If there is hell on earth, you will find it here.The army they are fighting is alien; both mysterious and ferocious. They are looked at with both awe and disdain and the Americans want to kill them all. However, there is a palpable sense fear among the men that this enemy will never surrender and will fight beyond what they feel is humanly if not morally possible. When one character hears about the Kamikaze\\'s flying their planes into ships, he asks aloud \"how can any man do that?\" \"The Pacific\" is fast-paced and each episode leaves the viewer wanting more. What lacks in the series is the intimacy of knowing the characters. They are kept at a distance almost as if the character doesn\\'t want to let you in. This may be the intent of the writers; just as the soldiers took little interest in knowing each other, maybe we are not meant to know the characters.',\n",
       " '\"The Pacific\" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg\\'s epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series \"Band Of Brothers\\'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it\\'s an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that. Narrative and overall story: The Pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of U.S. Marines, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie. The miniseries follows both these marines Sledge (played by joe mazzello) and Leckie (James Badge Dale) there is also the addition of marine John Basilone (Jon Seda) but he is a lesser focus. Now unlike Band of Brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions, the first few episodes follow Leckie and his experiences, the latter on Sledge. In a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series. This spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters. The downfall is that Leckie\\'s story is just simply not as interesting as Sledges, from the moment Sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him, here is this shy, awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer, of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists. The character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than Leckie\\'s thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster. When the sole focus is on Sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing, Sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this series.Acting: With such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers. Every single cast member gives a great performance, its gripping and believable acting at its best. The stars are undoubtedly Joe Mazzello who plays Sledge and Rami Malek who plays Corporal Merriell Shelton or \"Snafu\", a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with Sledge. Both give Emmy worthy performances and in Malek\\'s case i would say Oscar worthy. These are two very complex and incredible performances. Mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power: his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and Mazzello plays it to perfection. As the series comes to a close we really see what Mazzello can do: Sledge is beginning to lose himself, he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity, his compassion and his redemption. Its a truly powerful scene and one in which Mazzello does not utter one word, his face says everything and its heartbreaking. In fact that is Mazzello main strong point, his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face, there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch. Rami Malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing \"Snafu\". His character is incredibly creepy and odd, obviously numbed by the horrors of the war, but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him. Malek completely becomes the role, every mannerism, twitch, blink of the eye is perfectly done. lines such as \"I like to watch the new guys sweat.\" are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing. I will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed, if only Malek could win an Oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim. Malek and Mozzello also have fantastic chemistry, playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendship.Direction: remember the opening sequence of \"Saving Private Ryan\"? well imagine that times 20. I would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like. The battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed, even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series. Overall: the major flaw of this series if the first 4 episodes they simply don\\'t have the emotional impact of the rest, in fact they border on dull. However as soon as Sledge and Snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic. This series will take you on a haunting experience, you will be horrified, you will be moved, you will laugh, you will cry. As long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it.',\n",
       " 'I am a great fan of the original Band of Brothers and do realize that some of us do not get the feeling of getting close to the individuals as we did with BoB. The Pacific theater was different. The Japanese warfare was, and I suppose still is, different. I do not believe that it is fair to compare Pacific to BoB. We are trying to compare Apples and Oranges. I think that this miniseries is a great piece of historical story telling. Having read some complaints about the historical accuracy of the statement made in episode 3. What a wonderful thing that there are people out there that know the real history. Is it not a good thing that this miniseries actually gets us involved? That some, if not most of us, actually go and try to learn more about what had happened? Is it not a good thing that we hear names like Basilone ( a real hero), E.B.Sledge, and Robert Leckie? Normal people that have performed and endured in an utmost,and admirable way. If this miniseries has the power in getting our younger generation interested in this part of our history, it has done a wonderful thing. I would recommend for anybody watching this series to go and investigate the facts, read and educate oneself about the soldiers that fought for our freedom and for democracy. The only negative thing about this series is that the episodes are to short and the 7 days between episodes is to long. To all the Veterans past and present, thank you.',\n",
       " 'I couldn\\'t tell you how many times I have watched Band of Brothers. I think it is the best production ever made. However, I resisted watching The Pacific. My father had five years active duty in the Marine Corps when I was born, and remained on active duty until I was 30 years old. I was ten when he left for Viet Nam, the first time, and in high school the next. I had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded, or killed, there. I have always felt like Marines are family, and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see. However, I finally decided to \"man-up\" and watch it, on Veteran\\'s Day this year.I think BoB was a dream come true for the producers. They had ironclad characters to follow all the way through, and many of the men were still alive and took part in it. The story of Easy company had been put into book form, brilliantly. They didn\\'t have that with The Pacific. The closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men; Robert Leckie,Eugene Sledge and John Basilone. The three men\\'s paths crossed, some,but they did not belong to the same units or know each other, although Leckie and Sledge both knew Basilone\\'s reputation. As brutal and difficult as the war in Europe was, the Pacific war against the Japanese was almost incomprehensible. Except for their time in Australia, following Guadalcanal, they were fighting the most brutal fights in history, while in the most punishing places on earth.It is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life. Because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under, there isn\\'t much in the way of light-heartedness. The Pacific is not as enjoyable as BoB. Anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained. It is a bit more difficult to get into. I found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on. A little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off. I also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days, like I did, was much better than watching it as it was first presented, one episode each week for ten weeks.There were some excellent performances in The Pacific. Someone else singled out Ravi Malek\\'s portrayal of Merriel \"Snafu\" Sheldon as award worthy and I agree 100%! I loved William Sadler as LtCol. Lewis \"Chesty\" Puller, and I was also very impressed with Tom Budge as PFC Ronnie Gibson.The three primary characters are portrayed worthily. I didn\\'t think Joe Mazzello as Sledge developed his character as well as the other two. However, I ended up with only nine episodes on my DVR. The one I am missing is episode five, which I suspect is centered on Sledge, so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after I see it. Jon Seda gave a fine performance as John Basilone, which was definitely the roll of a lifetime! I think my favorite of the three was James Badge Dale, as Bob Leckie.I wasn\\'t as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many Marines being killed and wounded as I expected. That was partly because not many of them really looked like Marines to me. I have always said that you can put an actor in the Marine Corps uniform but you usually can\\'t make him look like a Marine. There were a few, though, who were totally believable including Jon Seda. Others have commented on the length of the men\\'s hair as being distracting and/or inaccurate. By my first memories, in the mid-late 50s, Marines were wearing the crew-cuts and flat-tops that they have worn ever since. However, I have pictures of my dad in uniform, from a decade earlier, with longer hair, so I think the producers knew what they were doing there.Although I agree with most posters here, that The Pacific is not as good as BoB, it is still well-done and definitely worth seeing. I think watching it with an open mind, and avoiding comparisons, it is a good way to approach it. One last comment I have is that I wonder why one young Marine, who was killed on Iwo Jima at age 17, was singled out in the tributes at the end. I assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed, and it was very effective, IMO. But I would be interested to know why they chose the one they did; if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man. I won\\'t say his name for those who might not have seen it yet, but I will always remember it.',\n",
       " 'After watching the first episode of \"The Pacific\" I have to say I was gripped. Now, it is important to realize one major thing about this series as compared to \"Band of Brothers\". This is bases on the real life memoirs of only three Marines who served in the Pacific Theather of the war, while \"Band of Brothers\" was based upon Stephen Ambrose\\'s account of a whole company of soldiers.This series definitely feels different in terms of the storytelling as it centers on a few select Marines as opposed to a company of them. So far, I definitely see the difference in the way this story is told from a perspective point of view. It feel somewhat more personal because of how closely it follows those Marines, which is as it should be given the source material.As a historian, I am excited to see the events of the Pacific Campaign chronicled on screen by the team behind \"Band of Brothers\". They have done such a remarkable job on the first series, that it is almost a complete documentary as well as an outstanding mini-series. I can already see the seeds of the same thing happening with this mini-series as happened with \"Band of Brothers\".As for the few down notes, which I will admit there were, they seem to be limited to quick story jumps (i.e. the night attack and morning after scene followed by the reinforcements marching past in the next scene). The introduction to the characters also felt a bit rushed, I think maybe focusing the entire episode on them like was done with the Camp Toccoa training in Band of Brothers. However, the episode moved quickly and was over before I knew it.For now, those of us that watched \"Band of Brothers\" know one thing for certain, we were spoiled by that series, which is possibly the best mini-series of all time, \"The Pacific\" has the best possible team working on it and is a worthy successor to it\\'s European Front sibling.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t compare the heroics of the European war with those of the Pacific war, but I\\'ve always been more in awe of the Pacific War. Unfortunately, this miniseries seems an afterthought, as if, after Band of Brothers, a Pacific vet went up to Spielberg and said, \"Hey, what about us?\" and Spielberg said, \"Oh, OK.\"The Pacific War was completely different in character from the European War, but this miniseries doesn\\'t show us why. It\\'s no accident that this miniseries is named for the ocean, yet here the Pacific is given only a bit part. What we see is the horrors of war we saw in Band of Brothers, moved to a different setting. The Pacific war was largely a naval war. Coral Sea, Midway, Leyte, were titanic engagements, each as dramatic as any island battle, with huge fleets on vast expanses of ocean. In fact, the Pacific War was a Marine war because it was first a naval war.HBO blew a huge opportunity here. Depicting the great naval battles has always been problematic in movies, because they\\'ve been impossible to stage without resorting to stock footage and cheesy process shots. CGI has now advanced to the point -- we got samples in this series -- where the titanic ocean battles that distinguished the Pacific War can be convincingly produced.I\\'ve read the books of Sledge and Leckie and can attest to their greatness. But there are also wonderful firsthand accounts of the naval side from which to draw. In fact, I think there were sailors who transferred from ship to ship, as they sank beneath them, who lived to tell about it. How about brothers or cousins, one on land, the other at sea, writing back and forth, as we witness their respective ordeals?Okay, that\\'s my slant. But even as it\\'s presented, The Pacific still lacks a dimension. If you want to know what it is, then read James Michener\\'s Tales From the South Pacific. I don\\'t mean it should replace what The Pacific shows us, but including Michener\\'s exposition and the naval war, would have kept The Pacific from being, for all its great production values and gruesome intensity, just another war-is-hell movie.',\n",
       " \"Overall this show is not bad. Id even say it is good considering. But is it great, no. The main problem this show had was character development which many of these other reviews point out. But you must understand why. In Band of Brothers (BOB), most of the soldiers were alive during filming, and remembered so much that they were able to give detailed descriptions of themselves and their friends fallen in battle. This series didn't have that luxury. Only 3 men depicted were still alive during filming. That makes it very hard to portray individuals accurately with no one able to recall how they acted. So instead, understandably, they went in a different direction and focused on the war. Of the 10 episodes, 9 had major battle sequences. BOB had only 7 episodes with such battles. 6 if you take away episode 6 Bastogne as it focuses on Doc Rowe and his problems getting medical supplies and the hellish cold those men went through. Not to mention the entire first episode of BOB was all boot camp for that much needed character development. In The Pacific, the first time you see the soldiers together its as they are shipping out for battle. I wont go on and on like some, but basically if you go in not expecting to care for the characters and to enjoy the reenactments of the battles you will like it. But if your a true critic, it will be only good at best. And thats to bad. Of course rumors are already circling for a 3rd installment focusing on Africa. Wonder if that will happen.\",\n",
       " 'What HBO & Spielberg are doing for America deserves my gratitude.  Probably the best thing about this 10 episodes mini-series is that the  more you watch it again and again, the better it gets.  The Japanese are depicted just like they were.  Try to watch episodes 5,6 & 7 non-stop and you will feel like you never  experienced something like that before. For me it was the violent and  tragic climax of all war cinematography in history.  You can\\'t help feeling deeply touched by Eugene Sledge\\'s experience in  war. Coming home and adapting to civilian life was just as hard as  surviving Okinawa...  ...Okinawa, Lord, how could people in the States expect these Marines  to \"get over it\" and become \"normal\" citizens after all what happened  there?! To find out, you must watch Episode 9, or better yet, read  Eugene\\'s memoirs: \"With The Old Breed\".  There are so many guys to talk about in this show: Snafu, Leckie,  Basilone, Ack Ack. Each of them special, enjoyable and unforgettable in  their own way.  ______Critic_____ If only the episodes had been longer... I have one  major complain that is about not making Okinawa justice. The TV episode  seems somehow not as beautifully horrible as compared to Eugene\\'s  memoirs.  All in all, I realize it wasn\\'t easy to tell the story of the entire  Marine Corps at once. While a Division was in Melbourne for relax other  could be fighting in Tarawa or Saipan. If we pick one division only,  the 1st in this case, we go with them to Australia and we won\\'t see the  big combat until Peleliu. If we had been with the 2nd we would have  been in Tarawa but not Peleliu, and so on. I think they choose right  taking the 1st Division because of the quality of Eugene Sledge\\'s  memoirs through Peleliu and Okinawa. We can\\'t have it all.  The main protagonist in Episodes 1-4 is a fascinating guy, Bob Leckie.  His personal story is worth being told but I think that because of that  they missed the opportunity to do a better job in portraying the events  in Guadalcanal. Perhaps they should have focused only in Sledge from  the beginning? And then there\\'s the legend, John Basilone. Another  story worth to be told but it happens the same as with Leckie. They  don\\'t fit well in Eugene\\'s story. They belong to different units, it\\'s  impossible to follow a storyline like in Band of Brothers because of  that. They are three Marines serving in different units and in  different places.  Conclusion: Perhaps The Pacific would have been better off if they had  followed one single storyline in one single unit, the K/3/5 where  Eugene Sledge served. Pretty much like Band of Brothers and the Easy  Company. We would have missed heroes like Basilone and fascinating guys  like Bob Leckie, but! we would have been much deeper involved in  Okinawa, the most horrible campaign in the Pacific War.  Despite this, my 10/10 stars are well deserved. Enjoy American history  with HBO, courtesy of Mr Spielberg, a great patriot. Edit: Also Tom  Hanks is a patriot.',\n",
       " \"First off I am a massive fan of the first Band of Brothers. The character development it presented as the series went on really drew you in, as a result you cared about them which is what made the tension of the series.Which leaves me wondering where BoB: Pacific has gone so wrong. Firstly, character development, there isn't any. You get a few token scenes of people saying goodbye to their families, and then bang you are on the beaches. As a result you don't know the characters, and so you don't care when they start dying. You have no idea of what these guys have gone through leading up the first assault, and you get no sense of their group dynamic. Its just a bunch of the most ragtag, barely military with seemingly no military training guys, acting like their hardcore vets off the set of Commando, where all it takes to defeat the Japanese is set up a machine gun post and the Japanese do the rest. As someone who is in the armed forces and studied the pacific war, the portrayal of the Japanese is ludicrous. They were some of the best jungle fighters in armed conflict, yet in BoB: Pacific, they are portrayed as cannon fodder. Yes, their fatalism is well documented, but it was always to a strategic end. Not in BoB: Pacific.Overall, thoroughly disappointed so far. The original BoB was amazing, and stands as one of the best WW2 series ever made. This, is something I pretend doesn't exist lest it ruin my memories of the original BoB.\",\n",
       " 'The pacific I awaited this with some hope of a similar experience to band of brothers, I have to bitterly disagree with reviewers who say it is a disservice to compare both that\\'s is how not just films and TV but anything that is reviewed we look at it as a whole and how it compares to other films or series in the genre, firstly the title is misleading just as band of brothers was not called \"The Europe\" neither should this have been called \"The Pacific\" it\\'s misses so much out on what was the biggest theatre of war During WW2, the first four episodes have been dull and narrow I do understand this loosely follows bob leckies book, but I really dislike the crime noir style of personal introspection or the emotional emptiness of say \"the thin red line\" Band of brothers worked so well because it showed the ambiguity of war the mix of love and hate, hope and fear and how different individuals perceive and handle it.The problem here maybe also be casting added that with a mix of a narrow viewpoint on such an epic story , I don\\'t really care for bob leckie or really any of the characters the story feels disjointed and does not flow like Band of Brothers or other great WW2 based series like \"Das Boat\" I neither hate nor love any of the characters, nor am I interested in their continuing story the problem is the pomp and ceremony that this so called epic was launched on and the sweeping openings all lead to a dull monotone experience with no soul, like our last episode with the Canadian committing suicide where was the back story \\x85why should I care.I will endeavour to watch the full series but it feels more like a task of work than entertainment, and lets not forget whether it is a docu drama or a soap opera its success is measured on it\\'s entertainment value it\\'s watch ability if you like, and it tells you something when you\\'re watching and you find yourself grabbing a look at the clock every 10 minutes hoping it is another 10 minutes further on than it is, if I had to choose one word to describe this it would be Flat I am not an effects junkie nor do I demand every episode with epic battles, But I do demand something more substantial that tells me about the story of those who fought in the pacific the airmen, the sailors, the marines, the civilians I did not expect \"mike hammer\" meets \"the thin red line\" and dialogue that could fit in a match box or go down well in a \"mills and boon romance\".This deserves a six out of ten at a push at that is mostly for the rather well done opening credits.',\n",
       " 'This miniseries just fell flat. And no, I\\'m not comparing it to \"Band of Brothers\".The character development is piecemeal at best. There is no depth at all. From time to time you don\\'t hear from central characters like Sledge or Basilone. Bob Leckie\\'s character was poorly written and James Badge Dale wasn\\'t that great at portraying it.The plot is unmotivated and it doesn\\'t flow. There\\'s also too much filler. I could have cared less about their downtime in Australia. Also, typical Hollywood plot treatment by adding the corny love stories. That\\'s why historical works like \"Gods and Generals\", \"Pearl Harbor\", \"Windtalkers\", etc flop more than anything. Too many love story subplots.They should have cut the series length in half (or made a long TV movie) and focused on John Basilone\\'s exploits. Cut Leckie and Sledge\\'s stories out. This miniseries didn\\'t do their written works any justice anyway. Personally, If HBO\\'s next move was to have a Pacific oriented WWII miniseries to complement \"Band of Brothers\", they should have honed in on the Japanese point of view (sort of like what Clint Eastwood did with \"Flags of our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\") or the actual naval battles/campaigns of the Pacific.The battle sequences are OK. Nothing special. As for those who think its unfair to compare it to \"Band of Brothers\", HBO gives you really no choice given the way they advertised the whole thing. \"The Pacific\" had boatloads of potential but fell very short. I only watched the very last episodes just to kill time before \"Treme\".',\n",
       " 'For some reason this movie had not been getting the greatest critic reviews. I do not understand that at all. I thought the movie was very enjoyable and a successful sequel in the series.For anyone who has seen the first Iron Man you can expect much of the same in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark like he is meant for the part. He has the same sarcastic wit and self-confidence that is evident in his other movie roles. Gwyeneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, has a comes more to the forefront in the sequel. I also personally love that Jon Favreau is the driver for Stark/Potts, and that he gets into the action a little bit. You have to respect the director for that, even though Jon has done plenty of acting himself.Normally in when they replace someone in a sequel with a different actor/actress I am very upset. However, Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 as War Machine/Lt. Rhodes made me happy. This is similar to what happened with Maggie Gylenhal in the Dark Night.Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury has a bigger role, and it leads all the viewers into wanting The Avengers movie to come out immediately. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks.All in all it was a well done sequel. The plot is not too convoluted to follow. The new villain, played by Mickey Rourke, is very impressive and fun to watch. The action scenes are all entertaining but they do not completely drive the movie. The only thing that I wished for leaving the theater was a longer final fight scene.Also, make sure to watch after the credits!! It is short, but worth it.',\n",
       " 'Reading Iron Man 2\\'s plot summary, things sound bleak for our characters. But not at all. This is a breezy, light-hearted, inoffensive affair that saunters at a magnetic pace, with emotional discomfiting a far thought. Which is pretty refreshing, to say the least. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the complete of antithesis of recent comic book movies. For one, it certainly isn\\'t darker than its predecessor, absent its slow-burning first half and latched-on social commentary. It also gives itself the poetic license to stretch credulity. This is a movie about a man who flies around in metal suit, blasting away multicolored-haired Russians with electric whips. Realism simply doesn\\'t apply, and thankfully director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux take affectionate liberty with the bonds of belief. Yes, Ivan Vanko can secretly build super technology unbeknownst to his suppliers. And yes, the only way to incapacitate a drunken Tony is to beat the crap out of him in a Iron Man suit. No complaints here! Iron Man 2 is also very much Iron Man\\'s superior, although partly by default. The first movie was stuck with a pedantic origin story. However, the sequel had no shortage of possible paths to take. Which did it choose? The way you should always go; the road of characterization. Rather than tediously expand upon its universe, Iron Man 2 simply reprises its dramatis personae and sticks them into situations graver than before, upping the ante but reiterating the overall heart and spirit of its predecessor. The characters are well-etched, each snappy exchange rendered with a mature pathos that contrasts with the spurious scenarios that they feature in between of. Iron Man 2 could easily be called a comedy, but the naturalism of the comedy is seamless; you get the sense that it would be impossible to write this movie without having these vibrant characters joke and jeer.To bring the clever screenplay to life is the phenomenal cast. Robert Downey, Jr., as always, is effortlessly captivating. Charisma defined and an scandalously unsung master of versatility (he\\'s not just playing himself, people!), it\\'s no breaking news that he\\'s still one of the most watchable actors ever. He is the perfect Tony Stark, and a more-than-worthy representative of the thinking man\\'s action star. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow as the pragmatic Pepper Pots is electric, and she too turns in a fine performance. Wistful, but by no means a damsel in distress, she is probably the realest character.The baddies, just as essential as the hero, don\\'t disappoint either. Another wrong from last time round successfully remedied is the lack of genuinely menacing villains. Jeff Bridges honored us with his always-welcome presence in Iron Man, but his warm affability was anything but menacing. This time, however, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (oddly, both novices to blockbuster attention) are on duty, offering more than enough bang for your villainy buck. Rourke as Anton Vanko/\"Whiplash\", supplements a composite of the unintentionally hokey showman, supercilious mastermind, and the seemingly unstoppable behemoth. This effectively fends off one-noteness, and Rourke perfectly embodies the duality of Vanko\\'s deceptively boorish visage and surprisingly vast intellect, while still indulging in the welcome irreverence that comes with the comic book villain (his Russian drawl is humorous but gives him an otherworldly conviction).Rockwell, on the other hand, is flat-out comic relief as Stark\\'s weaselly rival – though not necessarily a threatening one – Justin Hammer. He is excellent in the part; an absolute delight to watch, whether irascibly mugging in a loss for words with his insubordinate partner Vanko or, in one of the movie\\'s best moments, shamelessly accolading his own (faulty) inventions with juvenile zeal.Unfortunately, with all these characters butting heads for screen time, co-stars Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson as Tony\\'s pal Colonel James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes and eventual partner War Machine and alluring temptress of a new assistant Natalie Rushman, respectively, are given the short straw. Both are more than able of carrying a scene, but while the script lavishes Tony with many moments in which to brood his way into some fine character development, and to convey Pepper\\'s many grievances, neither supporting character is as lucky. Cheadle\\'s moments of potential are all obstructed by the War Machine suit, and everything otherwise requires him to lucidly voice reason as a foil to the devil may care Tony. Johansson is a non-event, her Natalie Rushman an amoral nothing role, and her Black Widow guise is not so much daring femme fatale as listless sex symbol. She acts as merely a vessel for fan service, be it in her skintight suit for the general audience or that she represents another stepping stone to an Avengers movie for esoteric comic book fans.The movie is inter cut between the scenes of terse characterization and octane action. The latter is a dizzying combination of rapid vicissitudes and toe-to-toe skirmishes, high on CGI, low on genuine peril. In fact, Iron Man 2 could quite possibly have been a masterpiece of the genre had it lived up to its first forty minutes of exuberance and intrigue. But once the clumsy pugilism of Iron Man and Whiplash takes place, the movie falls flat. The power play is nonexistent, because it\\'s hard to believe anyone could stand a chance against ol\\' Shellhead. And if no sense of alarm can be conveyed when Iron Man is caught in an unusually melee showdown, the flight sequences leave no impression. Yes, the special effects are astounding, but it\\'s all for nothing if there\\'s no dramatic undercurrent.Otherwise, please, don\\'t mistake my raving for fanboy hyperbole; Iron Man 2 is great. It\\'s well-written, well-acted, and simultaneously a loving throwback to comic book norm and a break from recent tradition. It\\'s a rare occurrence to be thankful for, because God knows if this follows the superhero trilogy formula, the third one will suck. Which would tragically make this movie\\'s thrilling departure from cliché null and void.',\n",
       " \"At its high points - the first act and the climax - Iron Man 2 is actually better than the first film. Everything up to and including the action scene in Monaco is just great fun to watch: the action, the character interactions, and of course Robert Downey Jr's wonderful portrayal of Tony Stark. And the action scene at the end is pretty epic.The problem is, the film just stops being so much fun in-between. In a large proportion of this time, it's either going too slowly with little happening that's exciting or even particularly interesting, or it's providing some silly moments like Iron Man lounging on a giant display donut. To be fair, there's no problem with the many subplots this movie has: they all blend together quite smoothly.The acting in this film deserves credit: almost everybody does a great job. Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow are just as entertaining as they were in the first film, Jon Favreau gets more to do as Stark's chauffeur, Don Cheadle is actually a little better than Terrence Howard as Rhodie (again, maybe because he has a bigger role), Mickey Rourke portrays a decent but overall ordinary villain, and once Scarlett Johansson is allowed to do something substantial with her own action sequence, she's well worth watching. The only weak link is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, who gets quite annoying after a while.Overall, Iron Man 2's slow middle section prevents it from being better than the first film as a whole, which is a shame considering how brilliant the beginning and end segments are.\",\n",
       " \"Jon Favreau knew exactly what he was doing with this movie. This is a sleek, no-holds barred superhero movie, with great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke. Let's face it, it was almost impossible to top the first one; nevertheless this a good sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever made. Scarlett Johansson fulfilled her role as the the sexy and cunning agent Natasha Romanoff, and Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Pepper Potts. Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's competitor, and does a pretty good job at it.The only problem I have with this movie is that too many things have been fitted into 124 minutes. I understand that the movie was meant to be a roller-coaster ride, intended to thrill, but a little more character development would certainly have helped the movie. For example Samuel L. Jackson ans Johansson's characters are underused. Also, the ending was a little disoriented and predictable; something just didn't feel right about it.All in all, Jon Favreau has made a movie that would please the fanboys and satisfy the critics. This is a movie that entertains, while still complementing the first movie, and setting up a third movie. If you liked the first movie, just go ahead and watch this movie - you won't see a masterpiece, but you'll have a fun day at the movies.P.S.- Watch out for the after credits scene\",\n",
       " 'Do you remember how you felt right after having watched \\'The Empire Strikes Back\\'? \\'The Return of the Jedi\\'? \\'The Matrix\\'? Or the first Iron Man movie?If you are like me, I would guess pretty darn excited -- \\'Can\\'t wait to see what happens next\\'! Now try to remember how you felt after watching \\'The Phantom Menace\\' and \\'The Matrix Reloaded\\' -- Well, after watching two of the biggest travesties in the world of sequels... I felt completely frustrated, angry and cheated! I won\\'t say I feel the same resentment after having watched Iron Man 2 but it comes pretty darn close.Iron Man 1? A fantastic movie! Iron Man 2? I want my money back! And my travel expenses! What is wrong with Iron Man 2? Do you have a couple of hours?Maybe...no script? Really, are these guys serious? They make a movie costing around $150 million dollars and the script SUCKS BIG TIME.Plot holes anyone? There is NO motivation: you have no idea why you should care about the characters, since the characters themselves don\\'t have a clue what they are supposed to do or feel and why in this story. I\\'m not saying the actors are bad, they are doing all they can, but they are given a crappy script to work with.No sense of suspense or danger: despite one hundred of explosions and a couple of thousand stray bullets in crowded areas, NOT ONE PERSON gets killed or wounded in the whole movie! The closest you get to \\'wounded\\' are a couple of bruises. How am I supposed to care for someone when I KNOW he won\\'t get hurt? This is a MAJOR difference from the first Iron Man movie, where the threat was real.Somebody desperately tried to make Iron Man 2 into a movie for all ages -- well, it worked, in the worst possible way.This is also why all of the action scenes are boring, since all you see is CGI animated cartoon robots bashing into each other -- sounds a lot like Transformers you say? That\\'s right, but with EVEN LESS human emotion, since no one gets hurt.It was pretty difficult to mess this up, but they somehow managed to do it.I\\'ve read all the rave reviews -- \"action packed!\", \"entertaining!\" \"terrific!\" Are we talking about the same movie here? Seriously guys, either you have a very low standard or you have never watched a movie that truly deserves those rave reviews, like: The Matrix and the original Star Wars trilogy. And no, I\\'m not comparing Iron Man 2 only to \\'classic movies\\'. Even newer movies like Star Trek or Kick-Ass or even Iron Man 1 were ten times better! Kick-Ass was made for $30 million, instead of $150 like Iron Man 2 and it completely kicks Iron Man 2\\'s ass in every department.I want to erase Iron Man 2 from my memory but I\\'m afraid it will be very difficult -- still having nightmares about Jar Jar Bings -- Thank you Iron Man 2 screenwriters, for ruining the Iron Man 1 experience for me. I wish I could sue you.Why I still give it 5 stars? Because the actors tried. And because I smiled a few times. That\\'s it. A DVD throwaway movie at most, it really wasn\\'t worth my money.',\n",
       " \"At first, when a heard about a second installment, i thought, i was unsure in it, because Jon Favreau is relatively new on the director's chair, so could he pull of another classic superhero movie?The answer is simple-YES! I saw it in its opening day and the theatre was full.I went along with a few friends, and all of them loved it!Here are some things, we all agreed we liked.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:It was pretty good in this movie-making aspect, although it is an action movie, there is some quite exciting development, especially the leads.Don Cheadle made a perfect substitute of Terrence Howard, and looked pretty good in the movie.So did the Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlet Johansson's heroines.For me, Scarlet is one of the most gifted and talented and in the same time, the most beautiful actresses in the last decade and even more.And last, but not least, of course, the Iron Robert Downey Jr., making one of his unique, specifically for him, roles.He is smart, funny and in the same time, well, action hero type of guy-he adds so much to this otherwise, stereotyped role.Sam Rockwell was a little irritating, but that's what his role is supposed to be, and to those who have doubts, yes, Mickey Rourke made a decent and interesting role again.TIMING:Almost perfect, except, maybe, the opening credits and a few over timed scenes afterwards, everything was alright and on the perfect spot.PLOT/STORY:I finally can say it-YES, the day has come.A day, where superhero movies haven't got just CGI, put a pretty decent story, attached to the normal amount of CGI.Well, hard to say normal, a little bit over-the-top, but nonetheless fun, when you get use to the headache.The humor was perfect, brilliantly touched to the smallest line.And most importantly-it's not that predictable-i don't mean the ending, but the development, leading to it.Excecutet skilfully, when looked from this point of view.CGI:10/10, nothing else to add.Believable Flawless.Perfect.With no big flaws or plot holes, very funny dialogue, skillful acting and good directing, Iron Man is definitely the best movie of the year so far.The perfect blockbuster as well.I'm glad a saw it, and if the first one didn't made me a fan, this one did.I can't wait to see it again.Cheers to Iron Man Amazing! I would've given this a ten, but with some very few weaknesses, i'll lower this a little, although it did make me a bigger fan than before...My rate: 7.5/10\",\n",
       " '\"Iron Man\" is not my favorite superhero(that place goes to Batman)nor does he rank ahead of Wonder Women still Tony Stark is an interesting cocky sucker of enough character to watch. As \"Iron Man 2\" for a sequel really delivered. As director Jon Favreau once again kept the action rolling with special effects and kick ass action sequences. Once again Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark former weapons mogul turned special agent Iron Man. This time his challenge is a Russian villain named Ivan(Mickey Rourke fresh off his classic performance in \"The Wrestler\") who wants to destroy the world with his new chemical and high tech weapons. And Sam Rockwell struts as a money hungry arms dealer.Returning is Gwyneth Paltrow as Tony\\'s girlfriend now company CEO. And to spice up the picture a real treat of eye candy is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha who\\'s sexy as hell! She becomes a new superhero! Really this film is a showcase for cutting edge technology that shows human inventions. And it was nice to see a cameo by Bill O\\' Reilly too. Overall this picture is a good treat of action and explosive technology. Probably a watch for any comic book fan.',\n",
       " \"Iron Man 2 is a fine sequel. Almost the whole cast returns intact, and director Jon Favreau has more screen time in his role as Happy Hogan. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is riding high after the events of Iron Man (2008). He has become famous worldwide, and he re-institutes the Stark Expo. But problems begin to pile up. Another wealthy industrialist wants his Iron Man technology. Then a new villain appears. Stark's relationship with his assistant Virginia Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also expanded upon. There's a lot going on in the film, but its rather weak script hurts it for sure. Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko stands out. He's more menacing than Obadiah Stane was in the first film. Vanko's first encounter with Stark leads to a thrilling fight scene. Unfortunately Rourke's character isn't fully developed. This is a problem with other characters in the film as well. Vanko is a memorable villain but if Rourke was given more screen time and his character had more of a backstory I'm sure he could have been even more memorable. Still, Rourke tried to make his character as complex as he could.The film's special effects are excellent. Some of the time, however, they're used on shootouts and explosions that don't produce much excitement. There's a lot more humour this time around. I was smiling or laughing during most of the film. Scarlett Johansson as the beautiful Natasha Romanoff gets to show off some impressive martial arts moves. It's rather funny afterwards because no one else can fight like her. Overall, the film is not as good as Iron Man. Still, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster and the performances are solid. I wasn't expecting much from the film but was pleasantly surprised. I recommend Iron Man 2.\",\n",
       " \"I went to go see this with a friend on Saturday night. Now, I heard the film from others that this a step or two below the original, but I went in with an open mind. By the time the movie was over, I was pleased. But then, after thinking about it more, this is a disappointment. The film is drastically different in pace. Honestly, it gets a bit of a bore for awhile, which never happened in the original. Sometimes, its just hard to take this film seriously as a superhero film. In my opinion, the overwhelming number of laughs and silliness in this film makes it hard to take seriously. There is a large list of new things in this sequel. First, we learn much more about Tony Stark's father than we ever did in the original. Its quite interesting. Jon Favreau has a much, much bigger role in this film than the original, and I absolutely loved his role in the film. We learn his character has a personality. The talented Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey,and I actually liked him better in the role. They both seem so different in the role. There's Scarlette Johansson as Black Widow. I was honestly disappointed with her role in the film. It was too small, I thought. Mickey Rourke is raw and sinister as Whiplash, the main villain, and its a perfect fit. He does an absolutely perfect Russian accent. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is a good fit for the most part, although it was hard for me to take his character seriously after awhile as a villain. Sometimes, it seems like all his character does is be funny. Samuel L. Jackson has a much bigger role in this film as Nick Fury (he had a credit ending scene in the original). In a way it succeeds over the original, but for the most part it doesn't. It's missing some of the excitement and originality that made the original a truly great achievement in film. This is quite a bit different from the first, and you may not like how different it is. I certainly didn't. Many new actors, and a whole different type of ballgame. There's a bit, I think, too much silliness in this film. But still, it'll do. Go see this. Its not as fun as the first, but its not as disappointing as Spider Man 3 was. And do be sure to stay after the credits if you're a fan of Marvel Comics. Make sure you notice Stan Lee's cameo in this as well. Its rather brilliant. Overall, good film.\",\n",
       " 'There are some films which take the genre to some other level. This film is definitely the one to do so in the superhero genre.Good : There\\'s a whole bunch of good things that I can talk about. Bryan Singer does his best to tell the story, considering the comparatively weak script for an experimental film like this. This was the first time in YEARS that a superhero film was taken seriously. Given that there had been no introduction to any of the characters prior to this film, it does a really good job to make them interesting. Plus, it establishes the conflict between Eric and Xavier, which have been an integral part of many films that came afterwards. Not to mention, the character introduction, especially that of Wolverine, was incredible. We instantly know the basic characterization given to each of them, which was enough to get behind the movie. Hugh Jackman was the optimal choice for the role of Wolverine, and he proved it for next 17 years. Every single actor have done a good job in their roles. Also, I believe that X-Men films have been the best superhero films when it comes to \"social\" themes. We get to see the first of many times two friends with different world views clashing with one another. It has grown incredibly stale now, but was great to see back then and some other films after this, especially First Class and DoFP. The mutants wanting to be accepted by humans, and the other mutants wanting to destroy mankind - what other superhero series have given such a theme, or a similar one? This movie is the reason we are getting films like Infinity War, Civil War, Endgame, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. While I prefer these over the first X-Men movie, if it didn\\'t bring the genre back on track, we would\\'ve never gotten such films.Mixed : It feels dated. Had it been made today, it would\\'ve been a lackluster. It was clear that they were trying to experiment with this movie and still figuring out how to get things right. While they got most of the things right, they could\\'ve made the story a little more complex.Bad : The story is quite a bit of a throwaway story. While there\\'s an interesting twist, it still feels like the movie becomes a little goofy and cartoony after that twist. Some moments feel like they were shoehorned just to give some \"comic accuracy\", but they didn\\'t feel justified. I believe that if you get the basic elements right, it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s not deadly accurate with the comics. But if you want it to be so, make some baseline for that. Don\\'t do it randomly.Conclusion : It\\'s a movie that set the genre back on track forever. While the story and script might feel a little lazy when viewed today, you can see that the execution of the ideas were as good as humanly possible. If you are a superhero movie fan, it\\'s a must watch. Not because it\\'s insanely great, but just as a reminder of what led us to where we are. I am a huge fan of the genre. All credits go to Nolan\\'s Batman films, the good X-Men films and Raimi\\'s first two Spider-Man films. I absolutely love the MCU and many DC films apart from Nolan\\'s trilogy - Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, Shazam, The Dark Knight Returns, Superman/Doomsday, etc. But for me, like for the genre, it all started with the first X-Men movie. So, I have a very special place for this in my heart, as a fan.Rating.Score : 8/10Grade : A-',\n",
       " 'There\\'s no doubt about it, X-Men is not a stereotypical \"comic-book film\". Whenever a movie is made that is based on comic books, there is always a fear that it can and will be typically pigeonholed into the \"comic book film\" genre and that the movie is basically made for the fans of that comic book.  Comic-book films are usually unrealistic and unappealing to the general audience.Bryan Singer, however, did a wonderful job at making X-Men a movie that will not only overjoy the fans of the comic book, but also the general movie-goer as well.  The movie is grounded, without the flighty unrealism of comic book material, and it delivers a message about prejudice that has always been what X-Men were about: fighting for a world that hates them.The performances are outstanding, especially Hugh Jackman who, in my opinion, did a dead-on Wolverine, and Patrick Stewart, who never failed to show the peace and self-control that Professor Charles Xavier always strove to maintain.Aside the characters, the plot was original (I couldn\\'t tell you what was going to happen in the end by the middle of the movie) and most importantly: the world was REAL.  The only suspension of disbelief that is required is the assumption that these genetic mutations can happen, and did, causing these extraordinary people.  Honestly, I was a little disappointed that the colorful high-flare costumes were omitted, but I instantly forgave Singer when I realized why.  It was simply to add to the realism.All in all, X-Men was excellent.  If you\\'re a fan of the comic book series as I was, then you\\'ll endlessly enjoy seeing these characters come to life.  And if you\\'ve never been exposed to the comic book, this movie will give you an entertaining way to be exposed to its message about fear, hatred, and prejudice.',\n",
       " 'The answer to that question can be found in this movie with a resounding YES.  Being a fan of X-Men comics and cartoons, I watched this movie with great skepticism.  It was wonderful how the characters remained true to the comics.The special powers that our mutant heros and villains possess are displayed exceptionally.  It made me wish that I could have a special power of my own.\\nEnough can not be said of the phenomenal cast of actors that were selected for their roles.  Not only did they fit their parts perfectly, but they made you believe.  Bravo to Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen and a host of actors who were lucky enough to take part in this adventure.Bryan Singer does a fantastic job of bringing it all together.  The special effects in this movie, only enhance the great script and acting.  After seeing the DVD with the outtakes, the editing was quite effective.The true battle of good versus evil can always make for a great story but when a comic book is adapted to film and you feel that what you see is really possible, it is a true stroke of genius.',\n",
       " 'The film version of Stan Lee and Jack \"The King\" Kirby\\'s best-selling comic book creation, X-Men, has finally succeeded where more than twenty years of four-color, superhero movies have failed.  They have finally got it right...It is a stunning cinematic experience, faithfully adapting nearly 40 years of continuity into a stream-lined, fast-paced, wonderfully exciting trip into the legendary Marvel Universe.  X-Men features incredible portrayals of much of the classic mutant cast, especially virtual unknown (at least here in the States) Hugh Jackman as Logan, the Canadian wildman we all know and love as Wolverine.  Jackman seems born to play this coveted role with every bit of gruff and grim gusto; his Wolverine looks as if he simply stepped off one of Chris Claremont and John Byrne\\'s exquisitely crafted pages.  The rest of the cast was also pleasantly well-casted and well-suited for their roles, including the handsomely chisled James Marsden as the stoic field commander Cyclops and the gorgeous Anna Paquin as the can-never-touch-but-wish-we-all-could Rogue.  Famke Janssen and Halle Berry are beautiful and bold as Jean Grey and Storm, respectively, not just appearing as fleeting shards of eye candy, but actually adding depth and strength to the flow of the film.  Patrick Stewart\\'s excellent Professor Charles Xavier is in fine Stewart fashion, extrapolating on his Jean-Luc Picard character, and adding genuine compassion and warmth.Ian McKellan is superb as the tortured master of magnetism, Magneto, playing the part with malicious glee, tempered with an extreme form of jingoism for his cause of the militant uprising of mutants over \"normal\" people.  His Brotherhood of (Evil) Mutants is composed of Sabretooth, viciously and animalistically portrayed Tyler Mane, The Phanton Menace\\'s Ray Park is the wickedly amusing Toad, and the stunning Rebecca Romaijn-Stamos is the shape-shifter Mystique.  Park actually had the most to say of Magneto\\'s henchmen, but it was appropriate as these three comprise an awesomely evil team of muscle and not philosophy like their leader.The productions values were spectacular, as were the settings, taking us from a stark, malign concentration camp in Poland to the wilds of the Canadian north to the serenity of Westchester, New York to a mind-bending climax on Liberty Island.  The action sequences were well-paced and action-packed, and much more smoother and better choreographed than any of the Batman films.  The special effects, especially Wolverine\\'s legendary adamantium claws, were truly awe-inspiring.X-Men was meticulously directed by Bryan Singer, who along with 20th Century Fox, actually listened to and cared about what X-Fans thought and wished to see on screen.  Although we would have all liked to have stayed in that theater for another 95 minutes, there are many more stories to tell, and God willing, Fox will let it happen.Most importantly, X-Men finally gives Marvel Entertainment Group a firm footing on film, a foundation that was never fully in its grasp until the surprise hit of two years ago, Blade.  Now that Marvel has discovered that it can succeed with its top-tier characters, the sky is truly the limit for its varied cast of great characters.  I hope that Warner Bros. will sit up and take notice at what X-Men has accomplished.  Maybe this will be a wake-up call to those studio executives in charge of Superman and Batman, and make them realize that the fans\\' input really does count in the end...Highest recommendation!',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve always been a fan of the X-Men, since the Animated Series aired (I\\'d never really read any of the comics though... ^_^). So when I heard they were making a movie about them, I was counting the days until it was released. Maybe that affected how I viewed the movie, but I was a bit disappointed. Director Brian Singer (Usual Suspects) did a good job with what he\\'s got... the multiple characters, etc. The whole project seems a bit \"safe,\" though, as if the producers wanted to make sure this big production didn\\'t flop. It\\'s a good movie, but not a great one. Fans of the X-Men might be especially disappointed if their favorite characters do not include either Wolverine or Rogue. Mine personally is Cyclops, but he had a minor role. James Marsden, who played Cyclops, was a bit on the stiff side, but I forgive him because I like him as an actor. On that note, all the actors did an excellent job, especially Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, as the forces of good and evil. It brought an endearing humanistic side to a story I had thought was dominated by sci-fi. If you\\'re an X-Men fan, I would definitely recommend this film--but you probably have already seen it! What X-Men fan would miss out? If you\\'re not a fan, maybe this movie can be a starting point for a new obsession... :o)',\n",
       " 'Special-effects and terrific 5.1 surround sound are the highlights of this science fiction film. And what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories, at least for 2000 when this film and DVD came out. At the time, they were the best special-effects I had ever seen, but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see. Audio-wise, the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie I\\'ve heard.As for story, once the beginning plugs for evolution and political correctness are over with, it is a simple good guys-trying-to-get-the-bad guys fare. It\\'s pure escapist fun made so with tons of sci-fi effects. The characters aren\\'t particularly involving, either the \"good guys\" or the \"bad guys.\" The two leads, played by Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, should have been, but weren\\'t. Jackman\\'s \"Logan/ Wolverine\" always seemed to be pouting and angry, but I guess he\\'s a favorite of females. For me and most males, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was a treat for the eyes. Her outfit was something to behold.If profanity bothers you, the film was treat in that department, too, as there was very little. Obviously, this film was popular enough to spawn not only a sequel but more in the making.',\n",
       " 'Was \"The Usual Suspects\" a fluke?  Bryan Singer turns in a decidedly B-movie job directing this flat, predictable comics adaptation.  It\\'s almost too faithful to its original medium, with 2-d performances from all the principals except for Hugh Jackman (as the grouchy Wolverine, he displays the closest thing to personality among these cardboard cut-outs).  Patrick Stewart is lifeless.  Ian McKellen, who was believably dark in Singer\\'s \"Apt Pupil,\" here only looks very drowsy.  And the X-Men themselves look like the cast of \"Dawson\\'s Creek\" in drag.This film has endless problems.  The action sequences, and in particular the climactic battle in and on the Statue of Liberty, look terribly staged: just as on the comics page, the characters halt to strike dramatic poses, or dotingly brandish their \"super powers\" (one of them, hilariously, even utters at one point: \"Storm, use your power!\").  It simply doesn\\'t work any more than if Singer had put speech bubbles above the characters\\' heads. Compare these silly little fights to the superb sequences in Jet Li\\'s \"Black Mask,\" (1996), a film shot for a fraction of this one\\'s budget but obviously with much greater talent and vision.For a comic with a rich graphical past, the movie\\'s art direction delivers a strangely bland, sterile look, both for Professor X\\'s school and for the Liberty set.  Both look low-budget, but neither is quite as bad as the villain\\'s secret seaside hideout, which Singer shot in such darkness that nary a detail can be seen.Oddly, \"X-Men\" looks like two different movies.  The first 15 minutes are lavishly designed and shot, from the opening flashback of Jews herded into a concentration camp to the discovery of a Wolverine slumming in a moody northern logging camp.  Then, abruptly, the flair is gone, and for the remaining 90 minutes we get a film that looks like one of the Star Trek TV franchise vehicles.  (Except for Storm\\'s look: it\\'s pure Penthouse Magazine, ca. 1975, with Halle Barry\\'s vapid expression rounding out the bill.)  The villains are half-comically done, but even that is a blunder by Singer -- we don\\'t really get any comic relief from them, and we can hardly worry too much about the X-men if they\\'re beset by the likes of a villain called Toad, and even less when they remind us of the far wittier and better-looking send-up of all this nonsense, last year\\'s \"Mystery Men.\"Apart from the inanities, there is also a true sin: it\\'s unforgivably trite when a pulp fiction like this one hijacks the Holocaust to inflate its meagre storyline and insincere theme.  \"X-Men\" isn\\'t really an allegory of genocide, or even merely of racism.  That stuff is just tacked on to what is really an exercise in big fights and big boobs -- the old Marvel formula. Fights and boobs aren\\'t bad in their own right, but they\\'re done much better elsewhere without the pretensions to social justice.',\n",
       " 'Fanboys have no sense of fun. It\\'s partly their influence that makes these superhero tales increasingly self-important and witless. If you flip through comic books today, you\\'ll find they tackle issues such as drug addiction, street crime, racial bigotry and homosexuality, all while muscle-bound louts in circus costumes are flying around and shooting laser beams out of their fists. And no one fights crime any more; they just wrestle with their own demons. I recently scanned a comic book where an old Superman and a young Superman were throwing trucks and boulders at each other as they screamed pop-psych jargon about their grievances in what seemed like an apocalyptic episode of \"Dr. Phil.\"This movie opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp—yes, a superhero movie with a realistic Nazi concentration camp—where we meet the villain Magneto as a boy, who discovers his ability to move metal with his mind. Once we\\'re in the present (or the \"near-future\"), we see the U.S. Senate debating on whether mutants like Magneto should be exposed and listed on a public register. It\\'s like the yellow stars and number-tattoos Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany. Get it? I don\\'t. How is a fear of Jews parallel to a fear of people who can walk through walls, shoot fire out of their eyes or control the weather with their minds? In this movie the earnest idealists are against the mutant registry and the snooty hypocrites are in favor of it. Frankly I\\'m with the snooty hypocrites. What would we do if there were real super-powered mutants among us? Thanks to the fanboys\\' thirst for \"realism\" even in comic book adventures, the issues of Wolverine and his ilk are made to seem like urgent social problems.Fanboys have no sense of humor either. A sense of humor is not the ability to laugh at everything, but knowing when something is funny and when it isn\\'t. Fanboys have nerd-humor. Nerd-humor comes from the desire to condescend to the very thing that one takes deeply seriously. It comes out in this movie when Logan (later to be Wolverine) mocks silly superhero names like Cyclops and Storm. \"What\\'s your name,\" he says to Professor Xavier, who uses a wheelchair, \"Wheels?\" This sounds like the movie spoofing itself, but it isn\\'t. It\\'s the movie congratulating itself for being aware of its own absurdities; and once it acknowledges them, it can dismiss them and take itself all the more seriously. This is in contrast to the 1960s TV show \"Batman,\" which really was a spoof. But a fanboy doesn\\'t get it, not even if you tell him the joke. \"Yeah, I know it\\'s a spoof, but what kind of Batman has a pot belly?\"Marvel Comics used to have a jaunty sense of fun, but that\\'s the company that introduced social relevance and superheroes who have everyday problems just like us. The DC Comics concept of heroes that are larger than life is dead and now even Batman and Superman have \"issues.\" This opinion will guarantee me 0 of 564 useful votes, but I think the ultimate superhero show is the wonderfully ludicrous cartoon series \"Challenge of the SuperFriends\" (now on DVD). It\\'s funny, fast-paced and entertaining in a way that a movie like this never could be.\"X-Men\" (the word \"the\" was dropped so that no one would give up on the title before he finished reading it) offers the usual fare for fans of fantasy blockbusters: great old actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan) spouting nonsense; younger actors delivering dismal wisecracks (\"You\\'re a dick!\"); rapid cutting so that we\\'re unable to savor a performance or believe that an actor is making more than one move at a time during a fight sequence; CGI out the wazoo; grand-looking sets and fabulous sound design for those who want their junk to look and sound good; and overblown music.Obviously I don\\'t like the movie, but it could have been far worse. I watched the whole thing; whereas I shut off \"The Fantastic Four\" (\"The Fantastic 4\"? \"Fntstc 4\"?) after 30 minutes. And I was amazed how compelling and subtle Anna Paquin could be in a sea of SFX. I kept wishing she and Hugh Jackman would steal away from the freak show, sit down at a coffee shop and just talk for 90 minutes.',\n",
       " \"This definitely isn't one of those movies with a lot of character development, but its not your typical action flick either. This is a beautiful work of art with a lot of stylized violence, desolate alleys with shady characters and ill intentions. The grungy neon lights of a dystopian future, the scarlet blood and glimmering glass, the hauntingly beautiful slow motion, what makes this movie great is definitely the visual aspects.Dredd himself is very one dimensional, forcedly so. Stern, analytical, gruff, his toughness masking a side of him the audience never actually gets to see. His character is described perfectly in the first few minutes by his new psychic apprentice, which is the last look you get inside of his head before its slammed shut. He is a man who takes his duty seriously to the point that it consumes him, defines him.Ma-ma is sadistically brilliant. Her mob-style domination of peach tree creates a claustrophobic apprehension for a threat far too big to take on in a box far too small to escape. The terror by which she controls the people is believable and vicious. Whats lost in character development is regained by the subtle twisted moments and reactions to the threats imposed on each of the characters.The psychic scenes were perhaps the most well done and paints a very nice psychological battle between the judge in training and her prisoner. I would've actually enjoyed more of these as they were very surreal and artistic. Its also cool to see the way she breaks him down even after he thinks he has the upper hand.Slow mo, the drug this movie centers around, makes for some very awesome fight scenes on par with Sherlock Holmes 2: a Game of Shadows and the Matrix. The visual effects were very well executed and i myself being a visual effects artist, have only one complaint. At some points the blood was a bit oversaturated and toonish, which was likely in attempt to match the comic but draws away from a few scenes.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m a huge fan of the comic 2000AD and the character Judge Dredd since 1979, and this film completely satisfied me. They changed all the right things and kept all the right things. Director Pete Travis tackled the problem of filming a comic book by making something that looks nothing like a comic book and more like an action movie shot on location, with a simple linear plot that keeps rolling and never slows down.Megacity 1 is made markedly less futuristic than the comic in order to become so believable that it is hard to tell where the real slums of Cape Town end and the CGI kilometre high city blocks start. I have an uncomfortable feeling that in less than a hundred years cities like this may actually exist.The comic Judge\\'s uniform works on paper but can\\'t in real life - giant golden eagles, shoulder pads and bronze name badges hanging off a leather one-piece body suit would sag, wobble and look daft. The movie gives us body armour that looks like it actually gets used whilst keeping the helmet exactly the same. The effect is striking and believable, like everything else in this film.The plot revolves around a drug which makes time seem to slow down a hundred times, the perfect excuse for scenes of ultra slo-mo explosive bloody (and beautiful) anatomically correct violence that earn this film its 18 rating. Not a kid\\'s movie at all. Every supporting actor looks like they came out of a gang documentary, scarred, nasty, sweaty and mean. Lena Headey totally kicks ass as the ruthless gang lord Ma Ma, calmly relishing the deaths of her enemies, eyes sledging from narcotic addiction.In a way this is Olivia Thirlby\\'s movie, since she gets the character arc, rookie judge Cassandra Anderson assigned to Dredd for evaluation and finding herself on a very steep learning curve. She is vulnerable, spikey and tough as called for, vital to the movie in order to balance Dredd.How do you play Dredd? He is the opposite of a character. He has no personal arc, never changes or grows. He has no sense of humour, the comic finds that by placing utterly deadpan \\'ol stony- face in ironic situations that reflect off him. And where do you find an actor prepared to wear a helmet obscuring everything but his mouth and chin for the whole 95 minutes? Karl Urban must be a huge fan himself to play the part so right. One reviewer described his performance as \"ego-free\" and it is. I didn\\'t see Urban anywhere in this movie, all I saw was Dredd.Me and Dredd-heads everywhere thank you Karl. You smashed it.',\n",
       " \"The basic aim of Dredd is simple – it needs to be bold, true to the source material and full of juicy violence, enough to wipe out the memories of the notoriously poor Stallone attempt of 1995 that threw plenty of money at the screen without bothering to work on anything resembling a decent script.The character of Judge Dredd, now entering his 35th year in UK comic 2000AD (they know it's 2012 - don't ask), isn't a complicated one. He is, as he is fond of stating, the law. The time is the future, and amidst the wasteland that is America there is a single, massive city with 800 million inhabitants, appropriately called Mega City One. It's quite the scumhole, and the only thing that stands between it and total chaos are the Judges, trained for years to be the ultimate in law enforcement, yet so outnumbered they can only handle 6% of the crimes committed. This, people, is as thin as the blue line gets.The film is written by long time fan Alex Garland (28 Days later, Sunshine), and has had plenty of input from Dredd's creator (and still main writer even now) John Wagner. Filmed in South Africa on what passes for a tight budget these days (especially for Sci-Fi), it could be compared to District 9 in terms of the sheer effort put into it, with a result that is similarly impressive although aesthetically miles apart. Director Pete Travis (Endgame) does an excellent job, and between them they have turned in a film that will stand the test of time as a superior, adult action movie.The premise is reasonably simple, something that works well as an introduction to what is, in the comics at least, a sprawling future world. Dredd is accompanied on patrol by rookie Judge Anderson, very well played by Olivia Thirlby, who is on the verge of failing her final assessment but is being given a second chance because of her powerful, and rare, psi abilities. A routine triple homicide (it's that sort of city) turns into a siege when they are trapped in a massive tower block by criminal nutjob Ma Ma (Lena Headey) and forced to fight their way out and stop her manufacturing the addictive new drug, Slo Mo. Obviously there's a bit more to it than that, but this is the basic set up and it works very well indeed, allowing for plenty of violence, some character development and no few explosions.I can't write this review without focusing on Karl Urban, who has previously stood out for his excellent turn as Dr McCoy in the Star Trek revival. Not afraid to go through an entire movie with a helmet on, he is spot on as Dredd. He gives us an emotionless machine, a man who cares for nothing but the law, but a man you want to get behind and cheer on as he splats bad guys left right and centre. The humanity comes from Anderson, and it helps that Thirlby doesn't have to wear a helmet herself, with the handy excuse that it interferes with her psi abilities. Between them they give us the tired old wardog and the 21 year old rookie on the streets for the first time, and you sympathise with the life of a Mega City Judge.Some people have criticized the apparent similarities between Dredd and the recent film The Raid: Redemption, in which Indonesian cops storm a tower block and much chop sockey ensues. To be honest, I was a little worried myself, but having seen both films I can happily confirm that they are nothing alike. Whilst The Raid is a pretty intense martial arts film which is rather dull between fights (although the fights are awesome), Dredd is a tight film all the way through, with the plot more than an excuse to go from fight to fight.In conclusion, I can heartily recommend this film, in case you hadn't guessed. It's sort of like a cross between Robocop and Die Hard, all moderned up and with better music. It's no coincidence that those are two of the most kick ass action films ever, and Dredd borrows from the best, although as Robocop stole from Dredd in the first place it's more like recovering pinched property. The 3D is actually worth shelling out for, and there are some beautiful sequences where it comes into it's own, whilst the film itself is gritty and dirty, although not without a few lighter moments amidst the carnage. The humour in Dredd's comic strips comes from the city around him rather than his own actions, and here's hoping we'll see Alex Garland penning a sequel that allows us to wander through Dredd's world. Quite simply a superior action film, and whilst it's no masterpiece (then again, it's not supposed to be) it's as good as fans could ever have hoped. Here's to the sequels\",\n",
       " 'Dredd (2012 is one of the best science fiction action film adapted by comic book 2000 AD. It is one of my personal favorite movies. This is the character that kicks ass! This movie is so much better than original Stallone film. Stallone\\'s Judge Dredd did not kicks ass, Karl Urban\\'s Dredd did! I love this film to death I love it so much and it is better than Judge Dredd (1995) and it always will be! Dredd kills like 50 people in here, there are 100 of bodies everywhere I love this action film to death! Lena Headey is such a bad ass, I told you the woman can kick ass and she would kick Emilia Clarke\\'s ass anytime. Lena was such a bad ass playing beautiful Sarah Connor in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles TV Series (2008). This movie is a lot of fun. Ma-Ma is not the law... I am the law. Dredd was a better comic adaptation of not only the story of Mega City One but also of Judge Dredd the character. If you were left with a bad taste in your mouth from Judge Dredd 1995 movie then this is the perfect flavor. Tons of action and gore to keep any guy entertained and before you realize it you are at the end. A must see not only for Judge Dredd fans but action fans also. The darkness and violence of the movie is how its suppose to be and the action just keeps building up throughout the movie. Action is well paced and believable. Not a dull moment.It is very violent, which I enjoy, but others may find it too much. This film is such a bad ass, he shots a bullet to the guys face and it melts his face off, that\\'s awesome!!! There\\'s a lot of slow-motion in here, but let me tell you something: Slow-Motions in here works, there is the reason for the Slow-Motion okay. Soon as he kicks the door in and he starts shooting people and in slow-motion you can see the bullets cut in the people\\'s up and that is great, awesome! Lena Headey plays a good ass villain, man you want to see her ass kicked! You want to see that Judge Dredd takes her up in the air, \"Your going down, your going down real good.\" I love this movie I had a great time seen it, it is a solid Rater R reboot movie for an adults and not a children. You can see people cut in a half for a true 80\\'s throwback kick ass Science Ficton/Action new wave classic I\\'m glad I enjoyed this film. It deserves much more respect than it garnered in the press and ticket sales. The acting is top-notch, a simple yet elegant plot device, and amazing cinematography. It may not have made a lot of money or been given the respect it deserves at this time, but I have a feeling that subsequent generations will find a hidden gem in this masterpiece. Personally I love Dredd, like any other comic character or real person witch stays true to his honor and values of life or society without making himself the exception of his own rules. That\\'s true ideology. Any other thing is propaganda or personality problem. The world has irradiated itself from nuclear war. The earth is all but a barren wasteland, with its remaining inhabitants crowded into Mega-Cities. Mega-City One\\'s population is 800 million, with its territory stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. Amongst the crowded chaos stands one force to bring order; a force that serves as jury, executioner, and Judge. On a day when Dredd (Karl Urban) is assigned rookie, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), for assessment, they would get more than they bargained for on her first day. In response to an initial homicide call at the city block of Peach Trees, they also discover a drug ring run by a woman called Ma-Ma (Lena Heady). But she won\\'t have the Judges taking one of her men into custody. And in an attempt to thwart them, she seals the block\\'s blast doors, leaving the Judges to fend for themselves as they battle to survive. In the future, America is a dystopian wasteland. The latest scourge is Ma-Ma, a prostitute-turned-drug pusher with a dangerous new drug and aims to take over the city. The only possibility of stopping her is an elite group of urban police called Judges, who combine the duties of judge, jury and executioner to deliver a brutal brand of swift justice. But even the top-ranking Judge, Dredd (Karl Urban), discovers that taking down Ma-Ma isn\\'t as easy as it seems in this explosive adaptation of the hugely popular comic series.That is your basic plot it is a lot of interesting titles that make this movie the bleak and desolate sci-fi actioner that it is. It is a dystopian Science Fiction action flick similar to Robocop (1987). This film works while Robocop (2014) reboot failed! Dredd is a 2012 science fiction action film directed by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland. It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. I am giving this film A 10/10 because it deserves it! I love this movie!',\n",
       " 'Just watched it on blu-ray. I\\'m not an expert on the source material, I never read much of the comic books, but I was encouraged by some of the reviews here. So I bought it at a discount, watched it, and...I love it. No, it\\'s not a masterpiece. No brilliance in the story, no $200M effects budget, no complex characters. Instead, it reeks of testosterone. It smells like victory. It tastes like the good old times of Robocop and Die Hard. It feels totally uncompromised and rare in today\\'s cinema.I like the simple construct of this movie. When \"Dredd\" begins, you\\'re thrown straight into the story. When the story ends, the movie ends too, no hugs or aftermath. The setting is somewhat contained, smallish in scale and makes the movie intense. The small effects budget is used well, practical visual effects mixed with CGI in an interesting manner. The uniforms are wonderful and the world is bleak in just the right way. This simple story is well-paced and never gets boring. Also, \"Dredd\" doesn\\'t pretend to be anything else, anything more than it is. It\\'s honest and uncompromising, It\\'s merciless and it\\'s solid.Karl Urban has got the perfect voice and chin (with that little frown) for this character. That\\'s right, the helmet stays on. He plays the main character in a certain wooden way that absolutely fits. I don\\'t remember much about the comics, but I remember enough that Urban does the character justice. He\\'s a very convincing Dredd and I loved watching him. My respect for him as an actor skyrocketed. He isn\\'t here to promote himself. He isn\\'t here to just \"play\" Dredd. He is Dredd. Well done, Karl. Olivia Thirlby is Anderson, Dredd\\'s sidekick. Don\\'t worry, because she\\'s not a female version of Rob Schneider, a forced love interest or some useless Megan Fox. No, instead Olivia\\'s character is useful, humane, interesting and brings a perfect contrast to Dredd - the balance is wonderful. Thirlby can act, and yes she is beautiful too. She\\'s simply adorable. Thumbs up.Lena Headey makes an excellent villain. She\\'s not your cardboard cutout villain, she\\'s more like a nihilistic drug addict. The fear she strikes into her minions (especially Domhnall Gleeson\\'s wonderfully played character) is not only believable but exciting to watch. Fine job.This movie works so well because there is nothing in it to distract you from what the movie is really about. There is nothing forced. No sentimentality, no token romance, no questioning of morals, no needless twists. On top of that, \"Dredd\" needed to be a really, really violent movie. And that\\'s exactly what it is. It\\'s brutally unforgiving in just the right way. It doesn\\'t quite turn into a gore fest, but the violence is effective and very satisfying. These things alone warrant a great deal of respect. We live in a time where everything is PG13, bland and full of some moral or political propaganda (of which some people wrongly accuse Dredd). For once, we got the real thing.What are the negatives then? I don\\'t know. I can\\'t find any significant flaws. Perhaps the soundtrack could\\'ve been more to my personal taste, perhaps the weapons could\\'ve sounded \"bigger\", perhaps some of the CGI blood could\\'ve been done in the old-fashioned way...see? I can only think of minor gripes. I wouldn\\'t even ask for a more ambitious storyline or a huge parade of special effects because I like how contained, simple and effective \"Dredd\" is. Director Pete Travis and Karl \"the scowl\" Urban, I owe you a beer.Dredd - no bullshit, just balls. Enjoy.',\n",
       " \"Let me start by saying, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as in my opinion, it did everything right. Sure, it had no real substance of a story line (hence the 8/10) but that didn't take much away from the film. The simplistic story also had its advantages, as more time could be dedicated to Dredd doing what Dredd does best, instead of messing around in lengthy conversations. Besides, a detailed emotional story might have made this film a flop, as the cold, ruthless character of Dredd would have been somewhat diminished if that had been the case.So what made this film for me? Simple, the fact that they weren't afraid to make it an 18. This lends strong evidence to the argument that if you want to make an action film that raises the bar, it has to contain all of the shots that just aren't allowed in a 15 rated film. The drug, SLO- M0, that is used by the junkies in this film to slow their perception of time, allows for stunning, and brutal, scenes that also look great in 3D. The 18 rating also allowed for the director to create villains that you despise and you can understand why the other innocent characters fear them, which engages us as an audience.The film's script is cheesy, but if you've seen the other Judge Dredd film, that'll hardly be a surprise. And I must admit that Karl Urban does a fantastic job of making the lines still sound good. And overall, the acting is good, which is a relief after seeing so many action films where even the main character can't act..Overall, a great film. Possibly not the best film to watch on a first date, but if you know what you're getting yourself in for and just want some entertaining action, I really don't think Dredd will disappoint.\",\n",
       " \"This is the dredd film you've been waiting for. It will not disappoint and it's close to the source material. If you're looking for a bad ass action hero and want some entertainment, then this is it.You don't really care for much of the characters except for the villain (MaMa) and hero (dredd). Dredd is the focus point and he is a bad ass. The director did a great job on the city and you really feel like it is a corrupt and decadent city where law enforcement officers can judge, jury and execute criminals on the spot.As I watched the film I was being surprised again and again. They really outdid themselves and it's a large improvement over the 1995 film with stallone. The plot is there, it fits in perfect and you won't question the plot or the motives of what each character does in the film. It is somewhat simple. I think this has a better plot than The Expendables 2 so if you were thinking it might be the same, then the plot is a bit better than that.The acting is average. It's good but there's nothing worth noting or exciting nor is there any acting that is bad. It's just okay and the only acting you need to care for is Dredd and Karl Urban nailed his performance as Judge Dredd.The film has a good pace and the action length was on the spot. I never felt bored while the action was going on or I didn't stop caring after a while when the action becomes too long. But this film was perfect in the action.The 3D affects were surprisingly good for once with the slow motion affects and this is coming from someone who is not fond of 3D. If you are a comic book fan of Judge Dredd and want to see a good judge dredd movie then, this is it.\",\n",

Consider that it had Rob Schneider in it. 'nuff said. This one brings us into the comics once again but this time, they drop the camp. It is well written probably because they had Alex Garland who also wrote 28 Days Later... and Sunshine among others. Karl Urban is not as imposing as Sly but he does a solid job. Most importantly, he's not impersonating Sly. Olivia Thirlby is great as a foil or conscience to Dredd. Their relationship is the heart of the movie. Lena Headey does a good job as the baddie. It's an interesting unusual choice. It's certainly not your average muscle bound villain.I did have 2 problems. First, Slo-Mo happens too many times. The first couple of times are interesting. I'm sure it's cool 3D fun, but even that would get tiresome. It's a balancing act between pace and cool and the climax needs pace more than cool. Second problem is the ending. The final fight with Lena Headey is not as climatic as needed. It's a bit of a letdown. Overall, this is super-fun despite the minor problems.\",\n",
       " 'In 1995 when Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone in the title role hit theatres; critics derided it, audiences dismissed it as \"dumb\" and it failed to achieve commercial success. Even though this film has gained a cult following, it just wasn\\'t the Judge Dredd movie fans wanted. Now a low key British film company has had another crack at bringing Dredd to the silver screen, and the result is a great science fiction action film that holds no punches and gives the audience a gritty, gory and surprisingly relatable take on the comic book hero.Karl Urban plays the titular \"Dredd\", not the most recognisable or bankable actor working, but certainly one of the most versatile. He has a far better hold on the role than Stallone did, Stallone gave a performance that was robotic and almost comical. Stallone would growl and maintain an immovable fanaticism to upholding the law, strutting about in his ostentatious costume. There was very little humanity to the character and it was difficult to relate to him, he was basically playing Robocop.Urban brings more humanity into it, when innocent bystanders get caught in the mayhem he\\'s sombre and vengeful. He treats upholding the law more as a burden, he would rather issue a life sentence than gun a criminal down. Only when the odds are stacked against him and he has to defend himself against armed goons does he act violently. Urban gets as much out this character as possible with half his face covered up. It\\'s not just an improvement on Stallone\\'s take on the character it\\'s an expansion of the comic book character too.The supporting cast are all excellent, and they all give great performances and have strong characters to work with. Olivia Thirlby as rookie judge Anderson deserves praise, playing a character with psychic powers is not easy, her approach on the role makes you believe everything her character can do. She is not a weak female role either she is never once the damsel in distress and there is no attempt and sexualisation. Lena Headey as the villain Ma-Ma steals every scene she\\'s in, a crazy blood crazed woman who almost seems to enjoy going toe-to-toe with someone as lethal as Judge Dredd. She doesn\\'t care who gets in the way she just loves the thrill of it all. An insane villain who is ready to just about pull anything is captivating and intense to watch, i really wish she had been in the film more.The Megacity in this movie is not the Blade-Runner-Esque city seen in the 1995 film, it resembles a modern day overpopulated inner city slum. This gritty realism is one of the films biggest strengths. Dredd himself is not a superhero, he gets shot and bleeds like everyone else this feeling of vulnerability makes it easier to relate to the character.There\\'s no Rob Schneider in this movie, oh no, no desperate comedy at all there\\'s just no laughs to be had whatsoever. This film is gritty to the extreme, people are seen being shot to ribbons, blown up, set alight, crushed, splattered, skinned, tortured etc etc etc. Yet it never feel over exploitative, just the right amount. It\\'s just how this stuff would happen in real life, once again coming back to the films visceral reality.The film is not without its flaws, coming off the heels of The Raid a similar film in premise about law enforcers scaling a tower block to get someone at the top floor makes one draw comparisons watching it. The Raid had amazing martial arts to make up for its slower parts and was consistently upping itself while being as gritty as it could be. Dredd doesn\\'t have anywhere near the impressive stunts featured in The Raid and it makes you wish you had seen The Raid after you saw this, because you keep thinking to yourself: \"this scene was done better in The Raid\".The slow-motion sections showcasing the effects of the \"Slow-Mo Drug\" are a little overused, the colour is over-saturated and these are the only times in the film where the 3D is used to a noticeable degree.Overall it\\'s a far superior Judge Dredd film to the one that came before it, and has enough action and doesn\\'t over-complicate itself to the point where people aren\\'t bored watching it. It takes a comic book that has been tagged as notoriously impossible to adapt, give it a gritty and realistic setting and cast some great actors to give the movie some life. I hope there is a sequel because it would be really great to see more of this version of Dredd, Urban has a better grip on what the character should be and i can see him taking it a long way.',\n",
       " \"Seventeen years ago, a Sylvester Stallone sci-fi action vehicle was released into the world under the title 'Judge Dredd'. Based on the character from the popular 2000AD comic book series, the film was a huge disappointment with critics and a source of much heartache for Dredd devotees in the way it seemed to blatantly disregard crucial aspects of the source mythology both in look and tone. Fast forward to present day, a world in which comic book characters mean big money for film studios, surely enough time has passed to give the old Judge another crack of the whip right? I'm happy to say fans of the comic book should be able to relax and enjoy this much darker and tougher representation of their much loved character. Although the film, and it's (permanently) helmeted protagonist is a straightforward and simple beast, it actually works all the better for it. Dredd isn't given a back story or imbued with much in the way of humanity, he's instead portrayed more as the mysterious 'man with no name' whose dialogue is limited to one-liners that usually precedes some serious ass kicking. Where the 1995 Judge film was light and comedic, this version is hardcore and extremely violent with some surprising explosions of brutality meted out in a world that's long since gone to hell. As is pleasingly more and more the case in mainstream action cinema, we have strong female representation in Olvia Thirlby as Dredd's rookie sidekick and a nasty Lena Headey on form and fresh from bad girl duties in the celebrated TV series Game Of Thrones. Dredd 3D can't and won't be considered a classic of the genre, but it's a huge step-up from the Stallone version and should satisfy any and all sci-fi action fans looking for a fun Friday night thrill. Visually arresting and with a sensible running time, Dredd rocks. 3.5/5\",\n",
       " 'Having feverishly waited in anticipation (skulking around IMDb, snapping at each morsel with fanboy delight) it was a joy to finally sit down in the auditorium; with Judge Dredd badge pinned humorously to my DK \\'Bedtime For Democracy\\' T-shirt (chortle).The film starts with some spoken exposition, although where there was once James Earl Jones, we now have Urban. Establishing scenes of chaos evoke familiarity, as Mega-City One channels more current, turbulent times. Herein we are thrust into the Iron Lawman\\'s world, and he wastes no time in dispensing justice most radical. Olivia Thirlby is introduced as Anderson, the rookie assigned to Dredd for assessment. She is played as Dredd\\'s emotive foil (much like the comics). Whereas in \\'95, William Wisher moaned that \" if I couldn\\'t care about him (Dredd), how could I hope to convince anyone else to?\"--Bunk line of thinking, creep!--here we circumnavigate that with Anderson\\'s character arc. Dredd is a hard-assed, business-as-usual guy, with the voice to match. Only rarely did his dialogue verge on the gorgonzola.The film is an unashamed, stripped back actioner with cinematography and music elevating it far above genre requirements. Think \\'Drive\\', with the electronic score and city shots, but scorched of gloss. DREDD is tough and that\\'s reflected in the architecture, the uniform, and the hardware. The judges rightfully look intimidating and brutal, and the closer-quartered combat, I felt, emphasised this. I also enjoyed the wacky array of citizens, a killer 2000AD touch.I\\'ve ran right of steam now, but overall, great film and look forward to watching it again. The film is a straight up 8, but warrants an IMDb 10 out of principle.',\n",
       " \"This is definitely one of the best action films ever made. And this is how action films should be.The acting is perfect, a very good effort in direction, effects are very impressive and some lines unforgettable. About the plot, it is just an ordinary day in job - no history of the character, nothing unnecessary. Just action!Karl Urban really surprised me with his acting - a fantastic performance! Really suitable for this role. I knew that Lena Headey is a very nice actress and she proves it once again in this film. Olivia Thirlby also gives a remarkable ''rookie'' performance.I believe that this Dredd deserves a sequel, with the same attitude and for sure Karl Urban as Dredd. If you are in the mood for an action movie, there is no way that this film will disappoint you: 95 minutes full of action.For sure one of my favorite action films ever!!!\",\n",
       " \"I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.\",\n",
       " 'Star Trek. When someone speaks this name, various images, ideas, characters and phrases come to mind. I know they certainly do with me. Characters such as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, Janeway, Seven of Nine; ideas like the prime directive; phrases like \"Live long and Prosper\", \"Good God Jim, I\\'m a doctor not a\\x85.\". I wouldn\\'t consider myself a \"Trekkie\", but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.To my great delight, I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening last night of JJ Abrams re-imaging of \"Star Trek\". I must admit that I was skeptical at first about taking such iconic characters and recasting them, even in younger iterations, because most people think of the characters of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov with the actors that originally portrayed them. These portrayals are engrained in the pop culture consciousness of the world and hence my skepticism arose. Fortunately, my doubts were unnecessary.This is not your father\\'s \"Star Trek\". From the moment the movie begins, so does the action and it never lets up. However, this movie has more than just incredible and intense action, it also pays homage to the series of old. Sure, they wanted to bring us a Trek for the 21st century, but they also realized that they needed to respect the source material and fans of a series that has been around more than 40 years. However, you don\\'t need to know much about Star Trek to enjoy this movie. Each character has been given a background and history that lets you know a little something about each one. There\\'s a lot to be told in an origin movie and it is handled deftly by both the writers and the director.But, what really made the movies for me were the actors chosen to play these roles, especially Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, aka \"Bones\". This movie would not have worked if the casting of these three characters had not been spot on. Both Mr. Quinto and Urban uncannily channel their predecessors, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. They took on some of their inflections, mannerisms and expressions to really give you a sense that they are just younger versions of the originals. Chris Pine, however, takes on the most memorable role in Trek history and makes it his own. This Kirk is not only the womanizer, lover, and captain that you already know, but as portrayed by Mr. Pine also has a swagger, bravado, intelligence, and is a complete adrenaline junkie. We could not have asked for a better Kirk in this movie.They have laid a solid foundation for a new series, with new life, perfect cast and a director with a true vision. If the first movie can be this good, my expectations for further adventures have risen exponentially.This is my first review for our website and as such might not be very good since I have no experience at writing reviews. I intentionally didn\\'t reveal any plot points so as to not spoil anything for whoever may read this. I may in the future reveal areas that may have spoilers but mark these sections so you can skip over them. I\\'ll be seeing Wolverine tomorrow and hope to have a review up by tomorrow night. Until we meet again, \"Live long and Prosper!\"',\n",
       " \"Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.Thankfully though, Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character, portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne, who ultimately rises to become Gotham's greatest champion. Don't expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie, waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume, as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen, it is well worth the wait. In my opinion, Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film, I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.One of the strongest features of the film, is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a 'Batman' could be a reality one day. The technology is current, with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets, again making the film work by today's standards. Plus, we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too, something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too, are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully, in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly 'normal' and manage to be menacing at the same time.Which finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let's face it, what a line up! Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katy Holmes, Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn't have faith in Christoper Nolan's talents and thankfully they took the leap...For the comic book fans out there, waiting to see this movie, let me assure you that you won't be upset. Imagine the darkness of the 'A Death In The Family' and the 'Year One' story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn't love these books. Well, this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale: Dark, brooding and tortured by his past, yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans, then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane's original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....Thank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here....\",\n",
       " 'To start off this review I\\'d like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze \"You\\'re not sending me to the cooler\", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it\\'s a shame it didn\\'t start off this way as it might not of died on it\\'s rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it\\'s not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne\\'s past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you\\'ve not seen it I don\\'t want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

       " '........ ..............................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL Warner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father\\'s Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!Director, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson & Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! In the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of \"Super-Star\". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a \\'Cult Classic\\' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so\\x85What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) On the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I\\'m sure Bale was already aware\\x85audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .For my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise\\'s-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn\\'t so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn\\'t up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .To highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .Before rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book \"super-hero\", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything close\\x85Let\\'s try to keep things in perspective, O.K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don\\'t hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you\\'ll be rating it at least 7 STARS! 10 SuperHero Stars...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com',\n",
       " 'I just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must say this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn\\'t have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn\\'t have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you\\'d expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of \"the young girl\" or \"girlfriend\". I hardly ever see action films nowadays because I don\\'t want to waste my time watching a conventional, corny, over-digitalized,plot less film. To be honest, I gave this film a chance not because it was a Batman movie, but rather because of the talented veteran actors as well as being a fan of Christopher Nolan\\'s previous films. Whether you\\'re a fan of Christopher Nolan or just a Batman fanatic, you\\'ll enjoy every single second of the movie. People of ALL ages will appreciate this film. The violence in this movie is not vulgar, but rather sends out a lot of great messages of loyalty, respect, and humility. Not only is \"Batman Begins\" the best of the Batman series, it is the most unconventional. This recommendation is coming from a person who mostly watches art-house/independent films.',\n",

This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did..\",\n",
       " \"First I would like to state that those who give bad score probably because this genre is not their cup of tea. Complaining about over the top action, lots of gore, unrealistic mob story, clearly you are in the wrong alley/department.I dont know about gangs, but I know that Gareth grows up watching Hongkong's action movie. So I think the story here is like a solid chinese triad movie. It reminded me to some of Chow Yun Fat's movie (ie a Better Tomorrow 1 & 2, the Killer, the Bund) and Kill Bill. Therefore, like I said, it's kinda mix of Quentin and Woo style with Brit flavor.\\nAnd If you replace all the casts with chinese actors then you get a blockbuster chinese movie.The acting is ok, the story and plot twist is quite fine, and the action is superb. It's really a showcase of how good Gareth can do in action movie, given proper budget. And maybe it is his signature, but there always a gas tank explosion in his work.My only complain, although Gareth has no trouble in killing the characters, I think he has problem in ending the story. I feel like he's ending the series because he's out of budget. The final episode is less satisfying.\",\n",

It\\'s got the binge factor that\\'s for sure, I was hooked from the first major action scene.They\\'ve really raised the bar on this in terms of British action / drama.To pre warn people - if you don\\'t like drawn out, viciously violent fight scenes, this won\\'t be for you, it\\'s graphic.',\n",
       " \"I can't deny the show is massively entertaining with some great characters and really amazing action scenes. I enjoyed it.My big problem with the show is how ludicriously far-fetched it is after the first few episodes, it was almost veering into fantasy territory! I definitely expected something a little more grounded or at least semi-realistic, but it's not at all once you get past the first episode or two.I also think Joe Cole was wrong for the part, I didn't ever get a real sense of volatility or menance from him at all....just didn't work for me. Cast is generally fairly good though.There are some amazing action scenes mid-season that never sort of appear again, I was disapppointed with the downward slide towards the end in this regard. But what's in there is really, really good. Real punch to it.If you love over the top, action packed TV shows with hyper violence, this one fits the bill pretty well, but it's not really intelligent or smart TV - more a popcorn show.A lot of people calling it the most violent thing they have ever seen, which seems a bit OTT to me - it is most definitely violent, but no more so than the likes of Game of Thrones or Banshee, or Boardwalk Empire.In fact I think because it's so ludicriously OTT, the violence doesn't even connect as much as it did in say, Boardwalk Empire.\",\n",
       " \"There came a point, about half way through this film, when I emerged from the world of wonder on screen, took stock of my emotions in that instant, and realized that yes, by God, I am LOVING this movie.I didn't really expect to, of course -- although certainly, I hoped for it. With such an incredible cast, an able director at the helm, a story of Bryan Singer provenance and the inclusion of some of my favorite, if lesser known, X-types (Darwin! Tempest! Havok!), I was eager to see this beloved band of merry Marvel mutants redeem themselves after the massive failures of X3 and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.Which they do. And how!One thing that the avid comic fan must do when approaching this movie, however, is to divorce themselves utterly from almost all established four-color X-Men continuity. Oh, some bears up, but by and large this is a whole new origin story, a reboot of epic proportions, and yet it is a retcon so cleverly done, and one that offers up a such a delicious mélange of complex relationships and sensible motivation, that all of the many discrepancies inherent in having Mystique on the side of good or having Moira McTaggert a CIA agent simply do not matter. Speaking of McTaggert, Rose Byrne is both comely and convincing in the role, and almost every other actor is perfectly, one might almost say forcefully, cast. McAvoy brings a kind of laddish charm to Charles Xavier that he mixes nicely with both decency and naïveté, and Michael Fassbender's nascent Magneto is relentlessly, even heart-breakingly, compelling. Their chemistry is electric -- theirs' is one of the most multi-faceted and sincere bromances the screen has seen in a good long while.The younger cast all impress, though particular praise must go to Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence as the petulant but pitiable Raven/Mystique (The Academy Awards have been good to young, hot X-chicks; let us not forget that Rogue herself, Anna Paquin, won for THE PIANO). Former child star Nicholas Hoult is also outstanding as the troubled Hank McCoy, and perhaps the most surprising kudos must go to teenage dream Lucas Till, who conveys the particular anti-social asshole-hood of the turbulent Alex Summers very convincingly indeed.The biggest letdown in the movie, acting-wise, is January Jones as Emma Frost. True, she is appropriately ravishing, there can be no denying that, but she lacks the\\x85 the zing of the written character. There is very little intelligence, snark, or even personality behind her interpretation of this most intriguing of mutants; she's just kind of Stand There and Look Pretty -- which, for one playing Emma Frost, is something a travesty.The only other weight under which this movie really labors is the fact that it is a prequel, and it therefore suffers from the feeling of inevitability that besets all such endeavors. Anakin Skywalker HAS to go Dark Side. Bilbo Baggins HAS to find the One Ring. And Magneto HAS to turn against humans; Mystique HAS to join him; Xavier HAS to end up in a wheelchair. With these definite plot developments looming, their eventuation is bound to be a bit of an anti-climax.And yet the fun part about X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is the journey it takes us on to get us there. Offering up plenty of surprises, some kickass action sequences, mighty fine special effects, sly humor and a killer cameo, it is without doubt the best comic book movie of the year – nay, decade – thus far. And considering how overcrowded that list is, this is really saying Something.Huh. A prequel that does not, in any way, suck.Amazing, isn't it?-- Rachel Hyland, geekspeakmagazine.com\",\n",

This new spin on familiar \"bad guys\" Magneto and Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new level of appreciation and helps give them so much more depth and pathos. Both sides of the fence (Xavier\\'s vision and Magneto\\'s contempt) are advanced and the brilliance of the plot is that both sides are understandable and relatable. The viewer can simply sit and watch it unfold but also be emotionally invested in the journey. During the second half, plot threads move towards resolution and action picks up. Xavier is a shining example and his journey throughout the film matches that of Erik.First Class never undermines the audience nor talks down to them and does all that is expected of it. It delivers great action, humor, effects and a strong connection between heroes, villains and those developing in between. The retro design is suave and making this a period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. The collaboration between Singer and Vaughn apparently was a perfect blend. Vaughn did a brilliant job and Singer\\'s vision from the first two films stayed in tact and was enhanced. I have to add that the score had a perfect heroic theme but was also moving and very well done. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast paced yet filled with depth, spellbinding visual effects and a gripping finale. In the end, they succeeded in re-establishing these characters in a superb and interesting manner. There is more to offer and more depth to appreciate. I certainly can\\'t wait for a sequel and inclusion of Scott and Jean from the original trilogy.',\n",
       " \"What stands out in this movie (besides the look of some of the mutants), is the clever way in which all the pieces fall into place as a prequel which cements the backdrop and tone for the previous X-men offers. This one however, stands above them though for the consideration and tact that has gone into developing these understandably complex characters. Resulting in a more complete movie experience.The leading cast do a brilliant job in giving you a sense of their conflict with ingredients such as prejudice, ignorance, a sense of belonging and bitter revenge giving the film a more humane feel than a lot of dramas allowing you to connect with the characters more easily.The special effects- lets not forget, are top notch as expected, but surprisingly very in-keeping with the film and doesn't take away from the other elements of it. The violence is clean but present, pitched right between a young and adult audience. There's also a decent amount of ironic humour thrown in, which, considering the party tricks on offer (by that I mean the powers and peculiarities of the mutants), just comes and goes naturally without feeling forced as like a lot of comedy moments in films of late.Bottom-line, this is a well-constructed, well acted Marvel film. I wasn't totally convinced beforehand, casting James McAvoy as the young Xavier, a full head of hair and northern accent doesn't seem the best fit after all. I can say that he fully realised that role and showed his range in playing a more commanding lead. Michael Fassbender has great screen presence and does a good shift as the Magneto to-be and Mr Bacon adds another interesting element to the story. All the supporting cast give a solid performance with everyone focused on the exciting job at hand and no weak links.Easily worth the cinema admission and thank god they didn't make it in hit-and-miss 3d, there's just no need! The best of the X-men franchise.\",\n",
       " \"I love the Xmen, I won't beat around the bush. There are so many mutants, heroes and anti-heroes that you relate can to at least one of them. The franchise has had its ups and downs. The first two films made the superhero genre what it is today. Stunning set pieces, breath taking special effects and a group dynamic that was brilliantly cemented in the second film. The third struck a middle ground where the spectacle overshadowed the narrative but was still a fun ride, and the last title Xmen Origins: Wolverine, was the only miss-step in the series. Xmen first Class is really very good. It manages to keep up with the first two whilst retaining an originality in its own right.The Direction is great, Vaughn's clearly got a knack for angles and keeping the audience engaged whilst the story chops and changes. The look of the film is modern, yet still has a 60's and almost retro look about it. The special effects are very good, though some how not quite up there with Xmen: The Last Stand. The energy is fast and relentless and the action sequences blend in with the dialogue sequences seamlessly.The acting is very good, though Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen are definitely missed, McAvoy and Fassbender do excellent jobs and really are in keeping with the characters you already know and love. Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw are deliciously malevolent and Moira Mctaggart is perfectly pitched. My only reservation about the acting in the film is of Mystique, who I believe wasn't quite right, her motives in the film don't seem in complete continuity with the rest of the films.A sequel has already been planned and I shall be eagerly awaiting it. Having Storm back in the series would be a personal highlight for myself, but not necessary. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that has watched the original films and even for newcomers.One thing I will add that I have noticed since watching the original trilogy is that in 1980 Charles is walking, but according to First Class he loses this ability in the 60's...\",\n",
       " 'The biggest problem of these prequels is it\\'s kind of messy to the original X-Men movies. Well, the filmmakers said this is a reboot but there are some references to the original X-Men series. Anyways, \"X-Men: First Class\" is fun and had a lot of great action. It\\'s the biggest X-Men movie ever made and it\\'s better than the last two X-Men movies.The filmmakers stated that this movie is a reboot but things from the old X-Men movies had an appearance to this movie. The problem of giving reference from the old X-Men movies to this reboot is it doesn\\'t make this movie stand alone. Maybe the references only made for the laughs but if this is a prequel then it\\'ll be a total mess.The best parts goes to the action(obviously). Matthew Vaughn knows how to make big and awesome action scenes. The best parts also goes to the scenes of Michael Fassbender. He really steals the show. He made Erik/Magneto more dangerous than ever. It\\'s fun and intense to see him do something menacing. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. James McAvoy gave a lot of heart to his role. Him and Fassbender had good chemistry.Overall, \"X-Men First Class\" is good especially if you are looking for large scale action. I guess large scale is one thing that\\'s missing to the first four X-Men films. X3 had a large scale action that left us hanging in the end. This one has the action finale that is intense and really big. Maybe the reference of the old X-Men movies is only made for the laughs. By the way this is Matthew Vaughn\\'s thing. There\\'s action plus comedy.',\n",
       " 'Director Matthew Vaughn is back for a more conventional super hero movie after wowing audiences with last year\\'s \"Kick Ass.\" He has redefined the \"X-Men\" series with a very stylish work of cinema as attempt two at creating a prequel is successful with \"X-Men: First Class.\" Like \"Origins\" there are a plethora of characters that the audience has to worry about, however, with the smart use of time and space Vaughn develops the roots of various mutants with a fluid pace. James McAvoy (\"Wanted\", \"The Conspirator\") and Michael Fassbender (\"Inglourious Bastards\",\"300\") set up the best on screen matchup of the year with their respective portrayals of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The film commences as Erik is separated from his mother and killed by a man named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, \"Frost/Nixon\"). This is followed by background of a young Charles as he befriends a very familiar character, Raven aka Mystic (Academy Award Nominee Jennifer Lawrence, \"Winter\\'s Bone\"). After this brief exposition, the audience is taken on a nonstop thrill ride as the mutants influence the Cold War. Erik embarks on a path of vengeance to kill Shaw. Since their last encounter Shaw has started his own mutant army and has a very dangerous right-hand woman, Emma Frost (January Jones, \"Mad Men\"). Meanwhile, Charles and Raven are tracked down by a woman named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, \"Bridesmaids\") for their mutant expertise. Everything is connected in one way or another as the 1960s setting makes the film a cool cinematic rebirth to a new \"X-Men Trilogy.\"The Good: Director Vaughn reinvents the film series with a very well written script and a dark old school spectacle. Combining the classic feel of the 1960s and the Marvel comic book guise with McAvoy\\'s ingenious, sexy interpretation of Professor X and Fassbender\\'s rugged vindictive portrayal of Magneto makes this the best superhero film of the year. The casting of two big name congenial actors as antagonists (Bacon and Jones) along with giving their motive multiple purposes is smart cinema. Cinematography finishes it all off with a mixture of \"Mad Men\" flare in a comic strip.The character development of Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, \"It\\'s Kind of a Funny Story\") is very irritating, failing to produce a motive for her later actions. This can be attributed to the fact that even though Vaughn does a good job juggling the plethora of characters, it is inevitable that one falls through the cracks. Also, the fast pace of the film foreshadows a climatic ending which in actuality fails to impress after the interminable build up.Vaughn is following in Christopher Nolan\\'s footsteps as he transforms his second superhero comic into motion picture form. He uses more of a comic book approach than Nolan casting to perfection and creating one of the best prequels to ever be made.',\n",
       " 'This film isn\\'t for all people. That\\'s to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you\\'ll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of \"time slowdowns\" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it\\'s all there. The story on the other hand isn\\'t very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly cliché phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it\\'s tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. \"I fight for freedom! I\\'d rather die in honor then live in shame!\" Sounds familiar? Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it\\'s still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.Now that\\'s fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn\\'t let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.So here\\'s the deal.If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You\\'ll be missing out if you don\\'t. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It\\'ll leave you in awe.However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that\\'s understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theater yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tons of reviews this site has to offer.',\n",
       " 'After I saw the teaser for 300 I knew I HAD to see this movie! From then on I avoided all other previews, reviews, etc. as not to influence my expectations of the movie. I then went into the theater on opening night with no knowledge of the plot... only that it had something to do with Greeks and Frank Miller! Ignorance is bliss! I was absolutely blown away. I\\'m a 26 yr old female who generally doesn\\'t watch violent films... but I found the battle scenes so well done and breath taking. I had chills and goosebumps virtually the entire film. I\\'m with many other reviewers, who felt like they had to contain themselves from shouting \"yeah!\" at times. Maybe I\\'m crazy, but I thought the whole movie was very sexy and passionate, whether it was the sex scene, a battle scene, or Leonidis addressing his men.I think it is a shame that so many people are condemning this movie for it\\'s historical inaccuracies, or it\\'s \"racism\", etc. People are reading far too into this movie. Whatever happened to enjoying a movie simply because it is entertaining and pleasing to to the eye? Don\\'t people watch movies anymore to escape from the daily grind of life? I know I\\'m not as well spoken as many who have posted here. I just think this was a fantastic movie. I didn\\'t go see it to learn anything! I just wanted to be entertained! And boy was I!',\n",
       " \"300(2007) Review: 300 has been given lots of criticism. People like to view in the political way. That is not the way. Here's my take.300 is an entertaining movie. This is all about the action and it's Spartans. The movie takes about the first 30 minutes to give us plot development before the Spartans take it to the battlefield.The action is the key. The slow motion action is what really delivers. This is like a ballet of blood done so nicely. The action needless to say is satisfying. We are given lots of campy dialog and some good humor here and there that works. Gerard Butler is wonderful. He embodies the great king. Becomes him.Now, on to the politics, 300 has it's own politics, but it was also based on a comic book written back in 1998. How can this be a pro-Bush statement? This is just like another Frank Miller picture, Sin City. The point is to make the comic book come to life. 300 was written by Frank Miller almost a decade ago and you think this is right-wing propaganda? Listen to me. Take a deep breath and lighten up. Okay? One last thing, this movie is NOT a history lesson. This is based on a graphic novel, similar to a movie made back in 1962, and is inspired by the battle in 480 B.C. This is not racist either.The Last Word: 300 delivers what is was sent out to do. Action. Entertainment. Skin. Ignore the naysayers and enjoy. Excellent popcorn fun.\",\n",
       " \"It seems that everyone who hated this movie must have written a review, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents to even things up a bit. First, if you assume every movie is made simply to uppercut some sort of ideology into the audience's chest, then yes, it does seem very racist, xenophobic, and the like. However, this film is based on a freakin' comic book! The Spartans were some of the most skilled, nastiest, nationalistic fighters out there, and certainly had reason to be more driven and nationalistic than Persia's, which was not an army of individuals fighting for their land and families. Should they have been portrayed differently simply to satisfy the current political climate? Are you mad? The cheesy one-liners are also evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. The exaggerated characters is further evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. This is not a historical movie, it is a movie which seeks to put a rockstar, no-holds-barred spin on a particular historical event. It isn't attempting to be accurate, or balanced, or anything of the sort, and it SHOULDN'T, because that isn't it's purpose. It shouldn't be obligated to do anything of the sort. It's ENTERTAINMENT. Nothing more. And it's damn good entertainment, in my opinion.Every scene is beautifully crafted. I found the slowdown to be stylistic and much of the dialogue, which is apparently cheesy and fascist to everyone else, to be at least somewhat inspiring, and certainly engaging. These Spartans were trained their entire lives to be warriors, their entire culture is built around success in battle, and you don't expect them to be quite skilled, much more so than a slave army, and quite patriotic? Also, this movie was from the point of view of the Spartans. How would this army have appeared to the Spartans? Wouldn't their stories now be over-exaggerated, over-simplified, almost legendary? There isn't a great amount of character development because this movie is about a battle, ONE battle, THE battle for the continuance of the Western world, and yes, IF the Spartans had been simply overwhelmed from the start, and if their Athenian allies hadn't completely CRUSHED the much larger Persian navy at sea, the West simply could not have existed in any similar manner as it has. And yes, the Western world is guilty of arrogance, overextending it's boundaries to the point of imperialism, however, it has given our world a plethora of all-too-important philosophical ideals that are simply irreplaceable if we want to live in a free society.I realize I spent a great deal of my time being critical of other reviews, so I would like to take the time to apologize for perhaps wasting the time of someone who was simply searching for a detailed point of view on the film. I can assure you that the film is action-packed. The scenes are absolutely beautiful, every one of them. The film is gory, but artistically gory, if that makes any sense. You'll know what I mean. The story is simple, direct, and inspiring. The acting is excellent. The movie, overall, was a tremendous experience. I give it a 9.\",\n",
       " '300 is an absurdly silly film. That being said, it\\'s one that really wants us to take it seriously, but to me at least, it fails to get me properly committed to the film\\'s characters and paper-thin story-line. But hey, at least this movie is stylish. So very, very stylish.Persians are trying to invade Sparta. Gerard Butler, king of Sparta, doesn\\'t want this to happen. He gets together 300 fierce Spartan warriors to battle the invading Persians. That\\'s your plot. There\\'s few movies I can think of that are actually easier to follow; Memento or Mulholland Drive this ain\\'t. There\\'s a sub-plot involving Butler\\'s wife doing stuff back in the city, but it\\'s a side-story that feels tacked on. One of my biggest issues with the film is the way this added sub-plot frequently kills the pacing of the film, with the cutting between it and the main story never really feeling seamless. Maybe such unnecessary scenes could have been cut, and instead we could\\'ve got a bit more character development for the Spartan warriors. So we actually, you know, cared about them as they became attacked by more and more Persian forces as the movie went on.Some would argue that the movie really doesn\\'t need a plot because the style and action scenes in this movie are very impressive, but I think a compelling narrative and fleshed out characters would\\'ve helped make this movie more than just a decent guilty pleasure. I don\\'t always like to compare movies, but I feel 300 does often try really hard to be Gladiator, so I might bounce back and forth a little between the two. Gladiator\\'s actually one of my favourite movies of all time, and would probably even earn a spot in my top 25 favourite films. Like 300, it has thrilling action and a great sense of spectacle (it should be noted though that it is a bigger film than 300- it feels more like a traditional Hollywood epic), but it also had narrative elements that I thought were actually quite strong. I actually cared about Russel Crowe\\'s Maximus (a great performance from Crowe, by the way), and I wanted him to get his revenge on the corrupt piece of work that was Commodus, played extremely well by Joaquin Phoenix. The film gave us a protagonist we wanted to root for, and an antagonist that we really wanted to see brought to justice, and therefore we become invested in the film, and this allows the inevitable final showdown between the two to be extremely intense. Add in a bunch of memorable side characters, notably those played by Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, and Djimon Hounsou, and you have a movie that\\'s elevated from being just another brainless action-packed revenge film to something that I believe is a near-masterpiece.Gerard Butler\\'s King Leonidas is... slightly harder to care about. He\\'s a fairly flat, slightly arrogant character- look at the way he just ignores his kid in the scene where he leaves for battle. Gerard Butler\\'s no Russel Crowe either, and maybe a better actor could have injected some more likability into the character. And sure, Phoenix did ham it up in Gladiator, but his character was still believable in the film\\'s context. In 300, we get a completely ridiculous central villain who is so over the top it becomes impossible to take him seriously. At all. He is one of the least menacing villains I\\'ve ever seen. Almost every thing about him makes me laugh- his theatrical poses, his slow motion yelling, his \"bling,\" his painted-on eye-brows, and his voice, which is about 3 octaves lower than you\\'d think it would be by just looking at him. Why\\'s he so tall as well? Seriously, this is one of the silliest villains I can recall in any movie I\\'ve ever seen.The rest of the characters are disappointing too- Lena Headey plays the queen as a cold, boring woman, rocking the same facial expression throughout the entire movie. Dominic West is underused here too; he just kind of lurks around making creepy advances towards Headey\\'s character. A few of the 300 Spartans get some character development too, but it\\'s all pretty limited.I guess I\\'m being too negative here. There are things about this movie I like, so I\\'ll just finish off the rest of the negatives first. The narration is forced, mostly unnecessary, and goofy as hell. The movie has some humour, but I often can\\'t work out what\\'s intentionally funny and what\\'s unintentionally funny. The slow motion usually works, but sometimes feels gratuitous.But sometimes this movie can get pretty cool/fun. You can say what you want about the acting, the script, and the lack of truly compelling characters, but Zack Snyder really does inject this film with a whole lot of visual flair. Without the unique style, this film would be almost worthless, and it\\'s the film\\'s main saving grace. It really does look like a comic book in motion, maybe not to the extent of Sin City (a much better film in my opinion), but close. Also, the actions scenes are awesome, and there\\'s quite a lot of them after the first half hour or so. Slow motion, blood spraying, limbs flying everywhere, Persian bodies piling up- it\\'s a spectacle of carnage, and may well have to be seen to be believed. If you go into this film hoping to see a number of awesome, large-scale action sequences, you won\\'t be disappointed. When this movie shows fight scenes, it commits. Those slow motion long shots that show the Spartans advancing towards the Persian forces, dispatching them as they continue to walk, are pretty awe-inspiring. Also, the ending to this movie I\\'ll admit is pretty good. It\\'s meant to have a fairly profound impact on its audience, I think, and it didn\\'t shake me to my core or anything, but it worked. It was a pretty strong ending to the film I guess.So, final verdict? This movie\\'s a bit of a mixed bag, with strong action scenes and direction, but unremarkable story-telling, characters, and acting. How much you enjoy this movie will probably come down to how much you enjoy its unique visual style, and that is honestly completely subjective. So give it a watch, and even if it\\'s a movie you hate, at least it\\'ll be good for a laugh. I mean seriously, the \"TRAITOR! TRAITOR!\" scene is Monty Python-esque. So does 300 work as an action movie? Definitely. Does it work as anything more than that? Not really, which is why I can\\'t enjoy it as much as Gladiator, or, to a lesser extent, Braveheart. It\\'s kind of on the same level as Troy: dopey, silly, and shamelessly promoting style over substance. But hey, that\\'s not always a terrible thing, right?',\n",
       " \"After gaving us some of the greatest epic movies in the last 50 years,it was clear that filmmakers needed to take them to the next level. But how can you make a new movie,for the audience to like,without recycling old material? Answer:You improve what old filmmakers couldn't:Graphics. Ben Hur,Braveheart,Gladiator,Spartacus and perhaps even Troy are only some of the epic movies that gave the audience so big thrills that they cannot be repeated. Almost every epic movie that will be made today,no matter how good the story will be or how faithful will be to reality,is bound to repeat itself.We got examples from Alexander and Kingdom of Heaven. 300 doesn't apply to this category.Besides it takes the epic to the next level.And more are like to follow. Just like in the Lord of the Rings,much CGI was used here. The result? This movie was a pleasure for the eye. All the camera work and graphics exceeded my expectations. I thought they were comparable,if not better,to the LOTR,go see for yourselves.I could write something about the plot or the actors's outstanding performances(especially Gerard Butler's..you see,being Greek-Italian,I wanted the best from the actors..Butler gave it. The anger in his eyes,the fury in his voice and the violence in his actions really reminded an ancient Greek king),but I won't ruin it for you. You must see it to understand how great this movie is.But always remember that this is a movie that is based on a graphic novel and is by no means a faithful depiction of what really happened in Thermopylae in 480 B.C. All those who will pay the ticket to see this movie,must be prepared not for a historic movie,but for a stylish battle movie. This movie,together with the LOTR,is the entrance to the 21st century's new epic movies. Kudos to Zack Snyder,who came from nowhere and has,already from Dawn of the Dead,proved that he is a brilliant and capable director. We will surely see more of him in the upcoming years.So,you read my Comment?Aren't you curious? What are you waiting for?Run to the nearest cinema,see this piece of art and when you are finished don't forget to come to IMDb to vote. This movie is destined to be at least in the top 100.C'mon people!Hail for 300,the Evolution of Epic Battles!\",\n",
       " 'Hearing that 300 is based upon a \" graphic novel \" which is a pseudo intellectual phrase used to describe a comic book I didn\\'t go out of my way to watch this because the present Hollywood movie making factory spends too much time and money bringing these type of stories to the screen . Also I was very unimpressed with director Zack Snyder\\'s previous film the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD which is a pale imitation of a superior movie . Sometimes prejudice can get in the way of judging a film of its own merits because 300 is one of the more memorable movie moments from last year and one that seems unforgivably ignored at the more prestigious film award ceremoniesBeing based upon a comic book you could say in all honesty that the visuals mirror those of a graphic novel , but I would claim it goes far , far beyond that and say it\\'s like watching a painting come to life . The battle scenes are entirely different from those seen in LORD OF THE RINGS or KINGDOM OF HEAVEN but are no less impressive and some of the battle sequences , most notably the ones featuring the immortals are terrifying . Did I say this film is like a painting come to life ? In some sequences it looks like a nightmare come to life and this stylish formalist type of cinema will send a chill down your spine . This is cinema strictly for adults onlyFans of ancient history and classical studies will find a lot to criticise because it\\'s not an accurate depiction of ancient Greece but you should always make the legend according to John Ford . Unfortunately by concentrating on the visuals there\\'s other aspects lacking . The Spartans don\\'t really come across as real characters from ancient times , more of a crowd of wise cracking macho cyphers and let\\'s be honest here , with the exception of voice over the dialogue is rather poor . It often reminded me of something present day Scottish folk hero John Smeaton might say : \" Dinnae come tae Sparta , we\\'ll set aboot ya up here \"But despite these very noticeable flaws this is a truly memorable movie down to the jaw dropping visuals and it\\'s the visuals the film will be rightly remembered for . It\\'s a pity that the Oscar voters have ignored 300 because certainly make up , cinematography , editing and possibly best supporting actor for Andrew Tiernan as Ephialtes should have been nominated at least and this film will be highly regarded in years to come',\n",
       " \"In the year 480 BC, King Xerxes of Persia set in motion his enormous slave empire to crush the small group of independent Greek states \\x96 the only stronghold of freedom still remaining in the then known world. As the countless armies of Xerxes approaches, King Leonidas petitions the ruling council to meet the army with whatever men can be found. With the council unwilling to release soldiers until after the religious festival, Leonidas sets out with his 300 strong personal army to meet Xerxes' men at a narrow pass knowing they must hold off the approach for as long as they can until the army arrives\\x96 even if it means their deaths.Although I am surprised to see this film so highly rated on IMDb, I can understand why it is so because it does deliver a powerful experience, almost powerful enough to carry it through its lack of real depth or substance. You can see the selling point on the DVD cover or the poster because it is in these places where any film visually has to sell itself. With 300 though this selling continues across the entire film because, holding close to the graphic novel roots, the visual design is the all here. The plot is simple and, although there is a little bit of politicing back home, the film is all about the stand of the 300 against countless others. In this regard it is visceral, violent and visually stunning. The mix of effects with live action brings the action to live and is as suitably overblown as the legend.Snyder's direction matches the effects and he wallows in every macho swing of the sword, doing really well to capture the action in a way that is engaging and clear. The lack of substance was a bit of a problem but to be honest the film does sweep you along in the moment of the battle and mostly this is all you care about. The cast don't really have characters so much as presence and mostly they deliver in this area. Butler is strong in the lead and he convinces in the role of Leonidas. Headley and West have the harder job back home to provide some interest in the politics behind the battle \\x96 they do well enough (particularly The Wire's West, but I'm biased) but the script does rather leave them to their own devices. The rest of the cast are appropriately muscular and heroic and fit in with what the script is trying to do.Overall this is an effective but superficial film. The design and the look is the all but fortunately it delivers in this regard really well. The performances, the script and everything else falls into line in supporting the graphic novel feel of the film and, although I would like to say I favour substance over style, it is hard not to like when the style is this well done.\",\n",

I had seen a little bit of the trailer and it did not really \"speak\" to me and Alita\\'s eyes were off putting.

I quickly got used to Alita\\'s eyes and they became in fact likeable.

The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed. Alita as a character is great, she is kind-hearted, innocent, naive and protective. Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. Alita is very likeable because she is such a good person in such a horrible world and you can\\'t help feeling very sympathetic for an innocent being like her as she is exposed to the cruel world of Iron City.I watched this movie without knowing the source material and I loved it. I was drawn in very early on and had to watch it a second time. I can definitely recommend this movie to anyone.',\n",
       " \"Alita Battle Angel is what happens when Hollywood finally get an Anime film right, ive gotta say James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez should work more together because this film is incredible.This film had heart and soul poured into its story and you could tell that 1000 of hours of work have gone into making this film. They've pulled one of the best films this year with incredible visual effects and CGI work that give this film a beautiful setting and background.The visual effect of Alita (voiced by Rosa Salazar) we're incredibly done giving detail in her eyes which made her character on screen look more like an actual human actress. Her character and acting is what made this film, they give her a human soul and a purpose with the writing which is so well done, it gives the audience an emotional journey of a young woman trying to discover who she is.The love interest side of the film is so done right it doesn't feel forced as well which along with its action sequences as well as it supporting cast was nothing short of perfect. The story does a great job of not revealing too much to earlier as slowly building up characters so you understand the story and draws you into every moment, this is matched by the awesome fight scenes and great formidable villains of the film adding to incredible film.This is one of those films that deserves a sequel and to be a successful film as of what they've realised here is one of the best live action anime films, with a damn near perfect if it was for slight pacing issue that doesn't really affect the film but is noticeable.Does it live up to the hype? HELL YES this film live up to the hype this is a must to watch on teh big screen hopefully were see a sequel come from it because it so needs it.Dislikes: The only flaw I spotted as ive said there was a slight issue with pacing, not that it affects the film in any way but was noticeable.\",\n",
       " \"Since Titanic and Avatar, I've stopped expecting Cameron movies to be great, but having seen this on 3D Imax the other day... let's just say he and Robert Rodriguez won me over again! Alita is the best big sci-fi action movie I've seen in a _long_ time. In an age where we're just seeing the same plots recycled again and again with interchangeable, soulless super-heroes, I enjoyed the hell out of this. I'm not saying it was perfect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I could have sat in that cinema for another couple of hours, without any worry of boredom. I can't remember the last time I watched a big effects movie and felt so completely lost in it.Although I was aware of Battle Angel Alita, I've never been a massive Anime fan and never read or watched the original anime, so I had no preconceptions or expectations going in. Many of the plot themes and ideas may have been done before(**cough** Rollerball - amongst others **cough**), but you can say that about almost any movie. The real question is whether those ideas are packaged in a new engrossing story with interesting characters and the answer, in Alita's case, is a big yes.Rosa Salazar is brilliant as Alita. The level of emotion she gets through the mo-cap is astonishing, and quite honestly puts many live action stars to shame. The large eyes may stem from honouring her anime origins, but you soon forget them, and only see the character. Not only that, but in the context of the story and her past, they feel quite logical.There's a hefty dose of Robocop to her story, in a good way, whilst her character has a sincerity and (non-annoying) innocence that all combines to make her a sympathetic hero that you want to see succeed. So from my perspective, I can't recommend Alita enough! This is the kind of blockbuster I hope is successful, because I truly want to watch the sequel.As with so many big-budget effects movies, I went in hoping for the best, but expecting yet another 'all-flash, no-substance' movie, like so many of the Marvel films. I was happy to be wrong for a change.I can't wait for the 3D Blu Ray to enjoy this again, and especially watch how it was made. I may even have to see it again at the cinema, before it finishes its run... It's been a while since I could say that about a big blockbuster!\",\n",
       " '\"I WILL NOT STAND BY IN THE PRESENCE OF EVIL\", an inspiring line spoken by the protagonist in Alita: Battle Angel when facing an indomitable and frightening villain got me thinking that I will not stand by in the presence of clueless movie critics giving lukewarm reviews to this excellent movie. Hence my motivation in writing this review to a film that I consider a great visionary triumph with such groundbreaking special effects not experienced since Avatar and a world-building as dazzling as last year\\'s critically acclaimed Blade Runner 2049.Based on the manga by Kishiro, the creative combo of Rodriguez and Cameron have created a world so technically stunning and cinematically immersive that it stirred and delighted my soul during the whole movie.At its heart, Alita is a tantalizing adventure about teenage self discovery and self fulfillment, although disguised by the plot which stated the protagonist as a 300 year-old alien berserker. The story combines science fiction with martial arts in a dystopian future. The fight scenes are as well choreographed as say The Matrix but avoid over indulging in extended and repetitive fight sequences. There\\'s a lot of exposition fitted into a 2-hour movie, hence some scenes seemed to be truncated in order for the story to advance accordingly.That said, the plot has familiar elements made new but in more interesting ways. Elements of a world constantly being monitored borrow heavily from The Hunger Games, with the adrenaline infusing Motorball acting as \"the game\". The action scenes are thrilling, at times violent but as explained earlier, never over indulges. And when such scenes are short, I found myself wanting for more, hence repeat viewing ensues.The film ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger, with fanboys like me hoping against pessimistic box office forecast that this movie will make enough money to warrant 2 more sequels to complete the overarching story of one of the most interesting female characters in one of the most visually arresting, imaginative and energetic science fiction movies of all time.Go watch Alita: Battle Angel. Highly recommended.',\n",
       " 'This movie was an absolute joy to watch and captured so much of what makes a great character driven action movie. Alita is visually mesmerizing and seamless, the CGI is as good as anything you\\'ve ever seen. What\\'s more impressive though is not the \"realness\" of it, but how well they capture facial movements. Alita LOOKS ALIVE. She isn\\'t lost in the uncanny valley, she EMOTES. She pulls you in and allows the full suspension of disbelief. She demands that you see her as real, despite the glaringly obvious unreal elements about her. The action sequences are done so well that they never feel like jittery clutter, that despite the incredible amount of movement and shear number of things in non-parallel motion the whole of the imagery is coherent. The actors do what they are supposed to do but make no giant waves doing so, and the story is what is clearly derived from a comicbook style, but is not wholly derivative either. Alita is a character that is both extremely powerful and yet fragile at the same time, reminiscent of Leeloo in the 5th Element. She is portrayed as real, and it is easy to cheer for her and feel for her. If you like scifi action with spectacular visuals and extraordinary characters then this is the movie for you.',\n",
       " \"Screenplay Co written and adapted by Avatar creator, James Cameron and Sin City creator Robert Rodriguez. Alita is a deep film that covers a wide range of themes such as female empowerment, personal growth, sacrifice and loss.The world is wonderfully imagined. Its also incredibly beautiful. In 3D, Alita looks amazing, she's vibrant and full of life, her skin looks so natural. Some people are moaning about the eyes. But those people are missing the point that Alita isn't human. Battle Angel borrows from other sci-fi stories in places. But this is a 20 year old graphic novel series. You can't expect total originality here. But like it's cousin, Avatar, Alita manages to carve out an interesting new world for itself, which in some ways is similar to its protagonist.The film had drawn some criticism for Alita's portrayal, as overly sexualized. I would argue those critics have entirely missed points made in the film. Or perhaps they haven't even seen it yet. Without giving anything away: calling Alita out for having an unrealistically small waist and big eyes is like moaning that the terminator sets an unfair standard for men. They're not human!Whilst I really enjoyed Alita, it could have, should have, been two films. There's so much going on that at times, some scenes can seem insignificant on reflection. In the grand scope of the story some moving moments are lost. Some feel a little rushed.So overall, a good film. Personally I loved it. Visually it's stunning. If you love sci-fi, if you liked Avatar or if you're a film lover, go see it! But watch it in IMAX 3D or at least 3D. Most films aren't worth it. But like Avatar: This isn't just 3D, this is James Cameron 3D. It's made for 3D.\",\n",
       " 'With 3 Oscar winning actors/actress and with a director name as big as James Cameron, you wondered what is wrong with all the Critics? Yes, I wondered. So I went and watched it for myself in Hong Kong on Feb-4th 9:40pm 3D IMAX showing; I\\'m from Los Angeles, CA on vacation. The movie delivers, on so many levels where do I begin? First, I love the continuity and the flow of the story from the first second of the opening sequence. There are just enough element and focus on each character to push the story forward and you actually care about Alita, which is where Marvel shines and DC failed; but DC have recently learned with Wonder Woman and Aquaman and their box office numbers reflected those lessons. The 3D was filmed in such a way to only use it when necessary to highlight depth and does not create nausea for even the most sensitive audiences during action sequences - super big plus on that aspect. If anyone doubt James Cameron has a hand in this movie\\'s directing, this alone should put any doubts to rest; Alita is an improvement on top of what Avatar did for its cinematography. Some critics made comments on Alita not caring for where she comes from, I would like to dispute that here. She emphatically on many levels and many parts of the movie wanting to look back toward her past - I believe the movie made enough effort on this. I feel its balanced, any more would have been annoying and I would even tell Alita myself, focus on your present and the future. Musical scores is a 10 in my opinion, the same group that did Mad Max, powerful, spot on.Now for its negatives, they\\'re not a big deal in my opinion. I wish the movie would be 30-45 mins longer and felt like they\\'re reserving it for sequels with an \"s\". Gone are the days when a single blockbuster movie is meant to stand on its own, so I agree with many critics on this aspect. But can we really do anything about it? That\\'s the big question.My personal opinion is a must see Sci-fi action flick in IMAX and in IMAX 3D, do not wait until even for your 65, 70 or 80 inch TV at home. Was going to give it 9/10 but due to idiotic critics, I move it 1 over to 10/10 to counter balance the B.S.',\n",
       " 'Battle Angel Alita surprised me as one of the best story driven action movies of the past years and here is why:Story:\\nsolid story-telling, no cheesy and time wasting flashbacks. Characters actions/choices are relatable and comprehensible and things do not just happen because somebody just did something totally stupid or unreasonable. Also the relationships between Alita, her \"father\" and boyfriend are built up well. Furthermore this movie was clearly made for a mature audience which is a great decision. Many movies like Star Wars and DC Hero movies have failed because they want to cater to kids, teens, families, men all at the same time additionally filling their movies up with bad/badly placed comedic elements. Alita, fortunately, has none of these flaws.Acting:\\nvery solid acting from everyone, but the Oscar goes to Rosa Salazar who did the motion capture for Alita. She did an amazing job! When I saw the trailer and those big eyes I thought this could only go wrong but Rosa Salazar gave real life to Alita.CGI:\\nFantastic! The design choices are impressive and the distinction between high-tech and low-tech battle equipment was nicely done. Movement is smooth and very realistic. Alita\\'s facial expressions are, in my opinion, the closest to reality we can get thus far.Action:\\nVery well choreographed action that refrains from many cheesy slow-motions and keeps it down to the point. It is also well placed and not too scarce. Plenty of action well interwoven with story driving elements - good job!Music:\\nElegantly placed and perfectly connected with each scene. Not as memorable as Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars or other Blockbusters, but it did it\\'s job well.Score: 10/10 - can\\'t wait for part 2',\n",
       " \"Stop reviewing a show based on half an episode and acting like u can develop a world in 10 mins! Futurama and even The Simpsons took a good season or two to hit their stride. Having said that, this is its own show and it is going to be fine as long as we allow it to be its own thing and don't limit it by looking at it thru Futurama/Simpsons lenses. Go in with an open mind and don't let it become a self fulfilling prophecy by nitpicking every little thing thru comparing it to Groening's past work. It's not a remake and there is no possible physical way you can know if this show is boring or poorly paced (it's not)if you've only watched 12 mins of it, a trap I see seriously like 48% of the reviews on here falling victim to. Look for the positives, Bc they objectively outweigh any negatives. Anything in the universe u go into looking to compare to something else, you're going to be disappointed in, Bc you're putting it in a box that's impossible for it to break out of and looking for it to match nostalgia, emotions from when you were different person, that evolve as we grow. A lot of people don't understand with shows like this by creators we expect to blow us away, it's not the show they don't like, it's that they can't recapture the feeling They had when watching the older work. It's the way they currently feel they don't like, and look for anyway to deflect having to accept that. Even if they are looking at the show, With that logic, the best it can be is as good as whatever they're using to compare, Bc that's the ceiling its not being allowed to climb above. Personally, I did not like Futurama when it started but now it's one of my fav Cartoons of all time. By the time the tenth ep of Disenchantment hit I was def already into it and loved the over arching story arc. THESE SHOWS TAKE TIME TO DEVELOP! Stop hating, and holding Groening to unrealistic expectations!!! Can't wait for more!!!With all the garbage on TV today I was more than happy to binge something light and funny that still takes time to build a fantastic world and allows stories to naturally evolve within it. The longer a show like this runs the better it gets, so let's support things like this, rather than allowing our collective need to be edgy and unique on the internet to outweigh well meaning creativity.........here's to hoping for 5-6 seaons!!! Cheers!\",\n",
       " 'With this show being from the creator of \"The Simpsons\" and \"Futurama\", I was of course curious enough to give it a watch, and I thought it would be as outrageous and hilarious as those earlier shows. While I didn\\'t think the show was terrible, it is to a degree somewhat disappointing. First, the good stuff in the show. Technically, the show is first rate, with good animation and art design. The premise and the characters are pretty original, making the show not feel like a clone of any past TV shows. The show is certainly not boring, and is somewhat amusing at times.However, \"somewhat amusing\" is about as funny as the show gets. The humor of the show lacks significant comic jabs to make it truly laugh-out-loud funny. The show seems to be content to move along with an amiable attitude instead of really trying to be hilarious. There are other problems with the writing as well. The creators of the show seem to be having difficultly moving from a 22 minute episode format to a longer version; you can really feel some blatant padding at times, especially with the first episode of the show. Also, the show is very slow in explaining details of the characters and situation at times. For example, Bean\\'s half-brother is not clearly identified or given a chance to speak until about halfway through the show\\'s first ten episodes.This is not a bad show, but currently it\\'s not reaching its full potential. It\\'s possible the writers will manage to improve things should the show be renewed. Until then, I would say give the show a chance by watching the first three episodes. If you like what you see there, you\\'ll probably find the rest of the episodes amusing enough. If not, then I would say skip the other episodes.',\n",
       " \"Before I begin I highly recommend that you watch the show fully. No matter how you feel about the start of the season (Which could go either way), the ending episodes will make you understand why you should watch all the way through.Nonetheless I believe that we are witnessing the birth of what could be an amazing serialized show. Future seasons could tell an amazing story that will set out in a world that could be quite expansive and deep and thrilling, while remaining funny and interesting. At least that is what they set up for themselves.The season starts off sort of slow, which personally I like. It introduces us to the characters and gets us familiar with them while providing good entertainment, showing their strengths and weaknesses, adding detail to the part of the world that we are in, and setting up storylines.I'm personally glad that they stayed in the kingdom for as long as they did, I feel connected to the Kingdom and will feel for whatever happens to it. The main trio is expanded upon marvelously. Especially Elfo and Beane as we see what makes them, them. They have flaws and character quirks, but they have beauty in them. They feel like what characters should feel like. They are neither perfect, nor are they completely useless. Lucy also gets a surprising amount of development. Even the King gets developed as the season comes to an end, which I enjoyed.Chekhov's Gun is in full effect which I enjoy, as characters are rarely discarded outright making the kingdom feel alive and interconnected.Overall I would say don't worry about people saying that it starts out slow, this isn't a movie, this is a series that should stay for a long time. This first season brought us into this world and gave us a shovel. It didn't waste ten episodes by running all around and barely scraping over everywhere. We have places to explore, people to meet, and a home to come back to that will be familiar and loved.In the end the ball is in the Creators' court. Hopefully the prove me right and use the rest of the show's seasons to expand upon this world they developed, to take chances, and to crack some good jokes.Damn this is going to be a long year to wait.\",\n",
       " \"I waited and watched the third season before giving this a review, so this isn't based on a small sample.Well acted, and classic futurama illustrations make for a great setting.However, this show isn't funny, and it's barely amusing.It took weeks to watch the seasons because I ended up using it as a fall asleep show.The jokes aren't just stale, they were never fresh. Elfo is a tiresome character and Bean just isn't amusing, clever, interesting, intriguing, or even has enough depth to make her a viable anything.Lastly, the king is about as hilarious as finding out you have a terminal illness.After three seasons it's time to he honest, and say these writers are just past their prime, and their jokes land with a resounding thud.Netflix has killed much better, and it's time to to add this to the pyre.\",\n",
       " \"The jokes are far more adult than Groening's other work, but also somehow much more immature. For example, in the first episode alone they make endless, cringeworthy jokes about cunnilingus/prostitution/racism/etc. but deliver them in a way that only children would find funny.The voice acting is decent, but it is a shame the characters are so one-sided and the dialogue is so terrible.I think the main plus is the world building, which leaves a lot of room for improvement. It is just that such an improvement should be led by a better team of writers for the regrettably inevitable second season.Clearly people put effort into the show, but too many core elements fall flat for it to work.(I also am a little bit suspicious of the validity of some of the positive reviews here...)\",\n",
       " \"So it seems like everyone and their mother expected Matt Groening and co to pull off a hat-trick and add a third golden animation series to his resume. It's hard to find a review that doesn't mention or compare it to his earlier work (And inevitably I will do so too). But people are being unfair, illogical and overestimating the current comedy prowess of the veteran crew around Matt.It makes no sense to compare Disenchantment to the golden age of the Simpsons, which lies more than 2 full decades in the past now. Nor to compare it to Futurama, which has been off the air for years now and that includes the revival, which was mostly build out of archived leftovers from the initial run hence why the revival was still top notch material.If you want to compare Disenchantment to something compare it to the last few Simpons seasons. Last one I saw was season 24 and that was already an atrocity so I can only imagine what depths they should have reached by now. Point here is: what was anybody still expecting here? that Matt and co would reinvent themselves after they've been unable to do so for years?Another major point in why a comparison is approaching disenchantment the wrong way is because it's clearly trying to be something different. There's a serialized narrative, a longer format, some mystery to the plot, a new painting-like art style (for backgrounds) and little segments here and there that seem to have a different purpose than straight up comedy, something that supports the idea that Disenchantment might not be intended or at least envisioned as a purely comedic effort.And herein lies the fatal flaw that impairs Disenchantment. It plays it way too safe. It doesn't fully embrace the new direction and misses on potential opportunities. disenchantment could have been crafted as a full blown adventure series, with a hefty dose of classic Simpsons comedy injected. There's a rule in comedy: the less grounded in reality your fictional creation is the harder you'll have to try to be funny. It's why series like family guy have to go way over the top while things like veep and curb your enthusiasm can keep it simple and still be funny. The idea is that making your comedy series more real creates potential to have impactful emotions beyond just those derivated from comedy. More grounded comedy series can instill for example fear, tension, sadness, melancholy etc. So in my opinion they should have shifted Disenchantment along the comedic spectrum in the opposite direction from where it is has gone now. Could have been something Avatar:TLA alike but with maturer comedy but now it's just Futurama in middle-earth.Which leaves us with only the comedic aspect as a potential selling point. And by now you've guessed it: it's simply not funny enough. Like another reviewer stated: Disenchantment seems to be content with being just amiable instead of being genuinely funny. I made it to the sixth episode. By then it came clear that there wasn't much novelty to disenchantment in general, they weren't really committed to the concept of serialization and this sixth episode was particularly unfunny. I'll give you an example of a joke from one of the first scenes of said episode (though it might not translate very well by just typing it out): The 3 main characters Bean, Luci and Elfo are playing a drunken game of guessing who the other is impersonating. When it's Elfo's turn he simply says: I'm Elfo.\\nLuci reacts: Hmmm, I know this one, (keeps thinking aloud for a few lines), I wanna say Schmelfo?\\nElfo replies: No! It's me, Elfo!........sigh.This sort of comedy level feels like watching one of those many third-rate short-lived stoner comedies on adult swim nobody's heard of or watches. Or like going to an amateur improv comedy night. Rest of the episode was on par, so that was my limit. In general it's fairly watchable, it doesn't deserve the 1 star rating from people who expected to relive the Simpsons/Futurama golden age and are just rate-bombing in frustration. It get's a 7.3 currently and that seems about right. 7.3 Counts as mediocre on IMdb but in my book average is still 5 logically so it gets a 5. Barely recommendable.\",\n",
       " 'The Revenant falls into the same category as Aronofsky\\'s \"Requiem for a Dream\" and Spielberg\\'s \"Schindler\\'s List\" for me, in the essence of being a terrific movie but not something I think I can sit through a second time. In all these movies there are brutal sequences that cause emotional stress and disgust just watching because it is so REAL and GRIPPING. To think that events in these movies actually happened or that they could very well happen is too much for me to think about. Not to say that I did not enjoy this film thoroughly. The Revenant is a technical masterpiece that left me wondering \"How the hell did they do that?\" after many scenes and sequences. With beautiful cinematography and adroit camera movement this film is a visual magnum opus. It is apparent that the great minds that put forth this film are none other than the same ones that brought us Birdman: Lubezki and Inarritu. There are many long shots without cuts that are sprinkled throughout the film that add a sense of sophistication to it with the added bonus of predominantly location based shooting and natural lighting for the film , that can even make a novice film watcher raise an eyebrow at its complexity. The camera work is not the only noteworthy aspect of the film; The actors did a superb job executing their rolls. Many are raving about DiCaprio\\'s performance but I was more of a fan of Hardy\\'s brutal and gritty character Fitzgerald. Granted, half the words that came out of his mouth were unintelligible but he left no doubt in my mind that he was fully devoted to his role and bringing Fitzgerald alive instead of just Hardy playing a character named Fitzgerald. He was simply amazing.With all this said, there are still flaws in the film. At some points it was dragging on and moving too slow. It gave the impression that the film itself was cocky and wanted to show off all of its beautiful scenery and camera work too much. Then there was the \"he shouldn\\'t be alive\" situations. Hugh Glass was a real guy that really did survive a bear mauling but in the film they make this guy practically immortal. There were too many instances where I was thinking \"he should be dead three times over right now, for me to enjoy the film as much I should have. All in all a great film that I only recommend to seasoned and mature film viewers.',\n",
       " \"Take the direction of Alejandro González Iñárritu, combine it with the stunning cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki and toss in Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy for their acting charms and what do you get? An extraordinary and masterful film.Fresh off of 'Birdman,' Iñárritu moved straight on to 'The Revenant,' a western-epic inspired by the true-life experiences of frontiersman Hugh Glass in the winter-struck landscape of 1820s America. The film gained some notoriety in mid-2015 for its production problems and has thus been regarded one of the most challenging film shoots in the history of cinema. Rightfully so. The film opens with the soothing sound of running water, thrusting the audience into an almost meditative state, and then it strikes, an action-packed sequence ensues with a near single sweeping take. Now this is a spoiler-free review, so I'll leave the pleasure of viewing that scene to you.This film heavily evokes reactions from the audience and does so well, whether it's staring at the screen in awe or gasping at the visceral violence, if you face this film with the right attitude and expectations, it will be a thrill ride like no other. Lubezki has proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning. Supporting this is the score from the relatively unknown composers, believe me, when the sudden orchestral boom strikes your eardrums, it's mesmerising.The makeup, the direction, the editing, the visual aesthetics, and of course the performances from a hopefully soon-to-be Oscar winning DiCaprio, 'The Revenant' is a visual treat for those who appreciate cinema and for those who wish to just get absorbed by the immense landscapes and poetic justice Iñárritu has given it. This is, for me, a modern masterpiece.\",\n",
       " 'I went to see \"The Revenant\" on the day that it was nominated for 12 Oscars, which certainly sets the expectation that it is going to be good – and it is. But I saw it described by DiCaprio as an \"epic art-house western\" and that\\'s a good description. In the same way that Iñárritu\\'s \"Birdman\" (this time last year) was unarguably a brilliant but not very mainstream film, so I think the Oscar buzz will attract a big audience to this movie who may find it a struggle to really enjoy. Because it is bleak\\x85 unremittingly bleak, in terms of the landscape, the weather and the motives of the characters. It is also extremely violent but, unlike \"The Hateful Eight\" (another film I saw this week that was unremittingly bleak) the violence is much more gritty, realistic and visceral making the drama a lot more compelling.DiCaprio plays \"Hugh Glass\", an historical figure who was a legendary fur-trapper in the early 1800\\'s and the central figure in this bear-related yarn. Although the story has been re-embroidered over the years, the \\'facts\\' align with the film\\'s basic story (there\\'s a good \"Daily Telegraph\" article outlining this - see the link on bob-the-movie-man.com).Attacked and pursuing by local natives, Glass\\'s party is striking across woodland when he is viciously attacked by a 500lb Grizzly bear. Although appearing mortally wounded, he is a highly respected individual and so is stretchered up by his boss Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). Unable to proceed further, Henry pays for the mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay with him, together with his half-Pawnee son Hawk and friend Bridger (Will Poulter), to die in peace. Predictably, Fitzgerald is not to be trusted, and Glass is abandoned in a shallow grave. If this is not enough, for other reasons we won\\'t go into, Glass has even less inclination to keep his fellow trapper on his Christmas card list. Thus is set up a classic revenge movie, with Glass determined to stay alive to enact that revenge despite the enormous odds stacked against him.This is surely DiCaprio\\'s year for his elusive Oscar as he turns in a cripplingly painful performance. It is clear that the suffering on screen is not all acting – it cannot be, given the inhospitable conditions in which the crew were filming (in Canada and Argentina). As examples he had to eat raw bison liver as well as suffering a much discussed Han \"I thought they smelled bad on the outside\" Solo moment. Despite having very few lines to deliver, DiCaprio is on screen for 90% of the time, and it is a bravura performance.Tom Hardy – also Oscar nominated – is also impressive as the villain of the piece, although for most of the time his lines might have well been delivered through his Bain mask for the sense they made. He is an inveterate mumbler.Domhnall Gleeson\\'s performance is also compelling, adding a degree of goodness and compassion to the film that was so missing from \"The Hateful 8\". (Gleeson is surely vying this year with Ben Whishaw for the busiest mainstream film appearances after this, \"Ex Machina\", \"Brooklyn\" and \"Star Wars\"). Finally Will Poulter gets a chance to shine in an A-grade mainstream dramatic movie and he well and truly makes that grade.Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu has to be commended for eschewing the use of green screens, insisting on live performances and in natural light to boot. Stylistically (and indeed story-wise) the film has many parallels with \"Gladiator\", with its effective and artistically constructed dream sequences. But the film is not without special effects, and these are phenomenal, most incredibly delivered during the relentless and gruelling bear attack scene: a seamless blend of live animal work and effects that make it horrifically believable.There is also some fantastic camera work (by Emmanuel Lubezki) of the \"how the hell did they do that variety\". Recalling his work in \"Birdman\" it\\'s challenging to do single tracking shots of people walking through buildings. To do these same tracking shots during a pitched battle scene is just phenomenal. During one scene in this harrowing sequence at the film\\'s start, the camera is on the ground filming a native galloping towards a victim, then the camera is seamlessly filming the rider as he gallops away. Astonishing.The only area I really didn\\'t care for was the music, by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. A combination of droning strings and (later) some whiny \"Ligeti-style\" elements, it was in turns intrusive, gloomy and annoying. Music should largely stay in the background to set the mood. This didn\\'t.Overall, this is a masterful film, but it is a slog and not a feel-good film to sit through. It also has significant violence which might not suit all viewers, with the final confrontation in particular being one of the most visceral fight scenes I\\'ve seen in years.By the way (I had to look it up) the definition of \"revenant\" is:noun 1. a person who returns2. a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost.Now you know too – this public service announcement brought to you by One Mann\\'s Movies!

       " '............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL *** This review may contain MINOR spoilers ***This Review is dedicated to my student and dear friend, Luisa Bacca, who has played a key role in focusing International Attention on the rights of Indigenous peoples in Colombia, especially here in Nariño, as a mediator in the ongoing Peace Process between the U.N. High Commission on Human Rights and the Colombian Government! Leonardo DiCaprio, upon his acceptance of his Golden Globe, used the occasion to express his concern for indigenous peoples and their portrayal in movies. At the time, this seemed a bit difficult to put into context, but now that I have seen the film, it is crystal! And I think there are basically 2 ways to react to REVENANT\\x85A straight up, grizzly (No Pun Intended!) true-story Man vs. Nature Action/Adventure, take it exactly as it is reaction, or, an infinitely nuanced \"This Movie is a Metaphor\" approach\\x85 Need it be said that I am most certainly an Option B person!?!?That having been said, REVENANT is such an astoundingly overwhelming experience, it is a tad difficult to decide on a starting point! Director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu shows himself to be the perfectionist he is via the numbing, jaw-dropping beauty of the filming locations that provide the numerous impressive visual backdrops seen throughout. The list of locations includes Tierra del Fuego, Mexico, and various U.S. and Canadian ones! As to the veracity of the \"True Story\" aspect of this harrowing tale, who knows? Wikipedia mentions that Frontiersman Hugh Glass\\' (Definite Oscar-worthy performance by Leonardo DiCaprio) life and accomplishments were often prone to embellishments, and Punke\\'s 2002 Novel apparently plays fast and loose with the truth. Aside from just what IS true and what isn\\'t, Gonzalez Iñárritu has permeated every frame with a level of reality that is truly chilling, both literally and figuratively! The U.S. was a relatively young country in the 1820\\'s; A vast, mostly untamed and rapidly expanding nation that had doubled its territory just 20 years earlier through the Louisiana Purchase. REVENANT unfolds clearly accentuating the uncertainties of life in the Missouri Territory, where the only existing technological implement in your daily existence was your firearm\\x85Oh, and probably, in Captain Henry\\'s case, a pocket watch, one would imagine! Their fur gathering/trading expedition comes under surprise attack (Was there any other kind back then?) by considerable numbers of Arikara Indians, who consider their actions as justified, since, in their opinion, it is the trading expedition that is trespassing on Arikara territory.After both suffering and inflicting heavy losses, the expedition\\'s survivors manage to raft away to safety. After cautiously biding their time on the river, they finally return to terra firma. Soon after, Hall has his ill- fated encounter with a grizzly bear, who, instinctively, simply was protecting her cubs. This scene is, quite honestly, spoiler- proof! No written words could \"ruin\" it for you! It is a bone-chilling vision that you really must experience for yourself! Most certainly, you will be scratching your head, as I and most others were, wondering \"Just how in the hell did they do that?\" Apparently, A Man In the Wilderness (1971) was also inspired by Hugh Glass and his ordeal\\x85But I never saw it! There is a 1972 film, which came to mind a few times while viewing REVENANT\\x85Jeremiah Johnson, A Sydney Pollack Classic with Robert Redford in the title role!Some of you might be wondering, about now, if there will be any reference to elements mentioned in this review\\'s title. Not to worry! My Review title should be \"crystal\", too, if you take the dualistic viewing approach mentioned early on here. To avoid crossing the Spoiler threshold, let it suffice to say that taking REVERANT in its entirety, it seems to speak to putting our treatment of indigenous peoples in the U.S. into some kind of more rational perspective. Personally, I found the ending to be rather spiritual and uplifting\\x85Maybe it\\'s just me!10*.......ENJOY/DISFURTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espanol, are most welcome!',\n",
       " 'Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I\\'ve always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with \"The Phantom Menace\" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he\\'s just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story\\'s outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn\\'t portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren\\'t explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can\\'t help being conscious of how he\\'s manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin\\'s portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn\\'t appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he\\'s special is that the plot requires it.If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what\\'s happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet\\'s inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.It\\'s true that \"A New Hope\" never showed Alderaan\\'s inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet\\'s destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke\\'s foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren\\'t there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was \"Return of the Jedi,\" which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In \"The Phantom Menace,\" he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren\\'t given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon\\'s word for it when he describes Obi Wan as \"headstrong.\" What\\'s most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie\\'s best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can\\'t hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children\\'s book that isn\\'t very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a \"wow\" factor in the movie\\'s visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the \"Star Wars\" movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they\\'re not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy\\'s continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today\\'s standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they\\'re almost universally acknowledged to be.',\n",
       " '\"Episode I: The Hidden Menace\" is perhaps the most ambiguous film in George W. Lucas\\'s \"Star Wars\" series. Met by the rather coldly stern gaze of critics, the first film of the new trilogy can cause some confusion in the viewer. There are not many action scenes in it, there are many dialogues and just a leisurely development of actions, which sometimes may seem like a forced filler with a connecting function between fights and races. But this is only at first glance, because if you look closely ...Young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his teacher, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson), go to negotiations with the Trade Federation, which threatens to blockade the peaceful little planet of Naboo. In Obi-Wan\\'s eyes, his mind and vision are already visible, his movements are already full of courage and confidence. Confidence and powerful, unquestioning dedication are seen in the young queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) that she is ready to do anything to help her people, the inhabitants of the occupied world federation. It is in \"The Phantom Menace\" most accurately and correctly disclose the nature and fragile at the same time in BOGATYRSKY solid Padme: it is able to stand alone against the decision of the Senate, venturing recklessly brave adventures and combine intuitive dictates of the heart with equanimity of mind.Qui-Gon Jin is unshakable and calm, in whatever situation he was. His eyes radiate wisdom and strength, a smile condescendingly reasonable, and the movements are smooth and weighed. But the main feature of Obi-Wan\\'s teacher is not in these, of course, the most important qualities. Qui-Gon, first of all, is a man of exceptional faith. Some of his actions seem too risky and thoughtless, but somewhere in general they can be mistaken for a desperate bluff. But for him, extremely sensitive to everything around him, holding in an unsurpassed harmony the awareness of his own forces and the sense of difficulty of the tasks set, for him, who knows how to feel the situation on many, many forward steps, faith is the main tool. With her help, he stands unshakably on his feet, seeking his own, by all means.Once having set a goal - to certainly train quite a young Anakin Skywalker - Qui-Gon will go to her persistently and steadily. He alone believes in the Prophecy of the great destiny of the boy, as if he did not hear the fears of the Jedi Council that Anakin\\'s uncertain future could pose great troubles to the Galaxy. But the foresight and the unique sense of Qui-Gon\\'s world allow him to see far further than to his eminent like-minded people and mentors, like Master Yoda and Master Windu. In addition, an extraordinary faith allows Qui-Gon to destroy any of his fears and doubts that can obscure his clear eyes. The moment of the film is very important, in which the wise Jedi tells Anakin about the medichlorians, micro-organisms existing in symbiosis with the cells of any living organism.\\nPerhaps, in these mysterious media chlorians lies the human soul, elusive to the eye and non-existent for touch. Then the wise counsel of Qui-Gon Jinn and unselfish greed deprived the boy Anakin Skywalker, wanted to visit every planet in the universe, it seems quite clear and sharp, Go up to the call of the heart, and you go on the right path. And even though this road is lost in the darkness of the gathering clouds, there will always be someone who sees a little farther than everyone else, and builds on this sagacity its most powerful faith. Qui-Gon believed in Anakin from the first second and believed in him to the end; most likely he understood the suffering and upheavals that promised further training of the boy for the Galaxy and for himself, but in one thing he was certain that in the final analysis Skywalker would return the Force to equilibrium ...Finishing on the major note of universal jubilation and festivities, \"Episode I: The Hidden Menace\" at first glance does not justify its mysterious and menacing title. But, having looked a little closer, we see that the holiday is just a calm before the storm, and a sweet truce is a tricky tactical ploy. It also becomes clear with horror that all the actions of all the heroes are quite comparable with the freedom to choose the actions of puppets tied to strong threads, for which someone is confidently pulling, able to control the movements of dolls by the easy fingering.And the violent protest of Padme Amidaly at the Senate meeting, and the murder of the mighty Darth Moule, and the fiasco of the Trade Federation, and the heroic death of Qui-Gon Gin, are all foggings in the plan of the mysterious strategist who is still hiding far from the battlefields, its galactic war. And Anakin Skywalker\\'s aching lead heart, which is filled with a burning, drying fear after the death of a Jedi so much loved by him, also lies in a small coin, albeit of a larger value than the rest, on a comprehensive battle map of the devilish clever and cunning puppeteer.\\nThe beginning of the saga is laid, the heroes are represented, the plot knots are tied. Star Wars Beginning',\n",
       " \"This movie, the most hyped movie of all time, has been put under the microscope and looked at in a variety of different ways. It seems that everyone had prejudged the movie before it was even released, and then strutted about claiming that they told you that it would be that way. There was the die-hards, who were impossible to dissapoint. There were of course the disenchanted and the unimpressible, who probably would not had conceeded the movie was good no matter what. There were the people who acted as if this movie symbolized their disapproval of media hype itself, and by principle decided to dislike the film. Looking over the other comments I see the opposing viewpoints clearly. OK, the movie was overhyped, but what do you expect in 1999, the year of hype? I was four years old when the A New Hope came out, and of course, I loved it. I was four, and a science fiction epic can have its way with a boy of that age. I think many people in the 20-35 age group expected to have that same life changing event that happened to them twenty years ago this time around. That is the equivalent of going to Disney World for the first time since you were a kid and being let down: Did you expect the impact to be the same? Take the movie for what it is. OK, it isn't just any movie, but it behaved like one, with strong points and weak ones as well. First the strong points.1. All the acting was terrific, with the exception of Jake Lloyd. Many critics complained of the stiffness of the Jedi characters. What some people saw as flat acting I believe was well acted restraint by Neeson and Mcgregor. Their characters were kung-fu monks, not the pirate Han Solo and the upstart Luke. 2. All of the sets and costumes were beautiful. Even Oscar worthy. 3. The music was terrific. John Williams outdid himself with the otherworldly choir at the end. Breathtaking! 4. The fight scenes were excellent as well, better than the ones in the Matrix because they had less special effects woven in. 5. The plot had more substance than the prior three combined. The intricate dealings of politics, the metaphysical properties of the force, the nature of bondage and the messianic innuendos sent me reeling. 6. The pod race. Ben Hur for the Space Age.And for the weak points: 1. The flow changed speeds too often, making it seem somewhat unnatural. 2. Something did not work for me with Anakin's success at the end. It seemed more haphazard than the supernatural workings of the force. 3. Jake Lloyd is not a good actor. Period. the scenes between him and Portman awkward and seemed difficult. 4. The fact that some of the races of aliens resembled ethnic groups should not be considered offensive (I wasn't offended, and could have been). It does, however, seem like a lack of imagination.Personally, I put this movie ahead of ROTJ, but behind the first two. It still definitely is worth watching. By the way, I was rather indifferent to Jar-Jar, as I was to the plight of R2-D2 and C3PO in all the other movies. I have a feeling history will smile on this movie as the story progresses in the future installments and we become more familiar with some of the new concepts introduced in this one. If you have decided not to go to any of them anymore, fine. That means just less of a line for me.\",\n",
       " 'After a long delay (and much anticipation) we finally got the first part of Lucas\\'s story, and where the trouble all began. Many other people viewed it as a rather sub-par attempt, uncreative and unsurprising. I couldn\\'t disagree more. One could go with the impressive state-of-the-art digital effects, one could go with the great cast of new characters (the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, for instance), the return of old favorites (Kenny Baker as R2D2 or Frank Oz as Yoda), John Williams\\' ever-wonderful score, the complicated story (I won\\'t bother discussing the plot; everyone knows what it\\'s about by now) or the awesome action sequences (the light saber duel at the end of the film is the best!). It\\'s obvious this film was misunderstood by many, and too many movie-goers set their expectations too high, which is unfair to Mr. Lucas to say the least. I was excited for the chance to see a new Star Wars film, but I took no expectations into the theater with me -- I went in ready for nothing and walked away very satisfied. I saw this film four times in the theater, something I don\\'t do much of these days. Lucas did a great job, and since this film is really only exposition for the overall series, how can one expect it to be a topper to the original trilogy? He\\'s just setting everything up! Give Mr. Lucas a break. If this film had been released first, it would have been the rage of ages just as A New Hope was when it first came out. Everything in this film was very nicely done; the cast and crew all performed their jobs exceptionally. The story was far more complex and interesting than usual, with more going on and more problems to solve. By the way, everyone, the \"Phantom Menace\" referred to by the title is so obvious that very few people truly understood what it was... the Phantom Menace was the orchestrator of the evil deeds, the driving force behind the attacks, the central villain of the picture... a character we see mainly as a hologram (only once otherwise): Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious is the Phantom Menace, and the evil single man who drives the entire plot. The movie was perfectly named. I loved this movie, and it has become one of my favorite Star Wars films (alongside A New Hope). I can\\'t wait for Episode II!',\n",
       " 'Well, after waiting 16 years for his next installment,  George has given us \"The Phantom Menace\".  As a Star Wars fan I got what I expected - another chance to immerse myself in the Star Wars universe - a film whose sole purpose is essentially escapism.  But as a movie fan, and judging it as I would any other movie, I frankly feel mildly disappointed.  Any movie that\\'s made can always be improved upon but I feel that this SHOULD have been better.  Firstly the good points :1)  The visuals are stunning - a lot of love and hard work has quite obviously gone into the effects and the people involved can quite rightly be proud of their work2)  All the performances by the main cast were good.  Particularly Natalie Portman and Pernilla August.3)  The Pod Race was exciting and amusing.4)  The final sabre duel was quite fantastic : Darth Maul prowling up and down like a caged tiger was a particularly excellent touch - it added real tension and anticipation to the scene.5)  The music as always was magnificent.  The Star Wars saga would lose much of its charm and intensity without Williams\\' scores.And now the negatives :1)  The pacing was too fast in parts!  The first half hour of the film just left me cold - you weren\\'t led into the story.  You were dumped straight into the action.  On paper I\\'m sure the first half hour looked fantastic but I found myself sitting in the theatre going - \\'hey, great special effect shot there!\\'  I wasn\\'t involved in the story and the scenes lacked tension and danger.2)  The film only truly started for me on reaching Tatooine.  I finally got a chance to get to know the characters.  However there still was not enough character development in the film as a whole.  For example,  Obi Wan had nothing to do or say throughout the movie except flash his light sabre around from time-to-time.  Who is Obi Wan???  After seeing the film I\\'m none the wiser.  And the final sabre duel (good as it was) would have been infinitely better had the relationship between Qui-Gon and Obi Wan been explored past the mere mentor-apprentice motif.  The final sabre duel lacked emotional involvement as a consequence.3)  Why did they make Jar-Jar so incomprehensible??  I found myself becoming annoyed at having to strain to understand his nonsensical utterings! (Having said that, he wasn\\'t as annoying as I\\'d been led to expect)  Why George used easily identifiable racial accents for his alien characters completely puzzled me. It just shows a lack of imagination!4)  Not enough Darth Maul.5)  What\\'s with the biological exposition on the Force!  Was that necessary? The first three films pointed to links between the Force and genetics but I don\\'t need tiresome cold scientific explanations as to the Force\\'s origin, thank you very much!  It just ruins the mystique.6)  Can we have less of the mindless gaffes that occur in the final battle scenes (You know the ones that save the day!)  Its an insult to the audience\\'s intelligence (In a full theatre I swear I didn\\'t see a single soul who looked under sixteen! - has George forgotten about the original fans).  In the original trilogy there was none of this cringeful embarrassing material (Ewoks excepted!!)Well I think I\\'ll stop there.  To summarise : a good movie that could have been a whole lot better.  Perhaps there was too much story to cover in two hours?  In which case the plot should have been shortened on the adage that \"less is more\".  I\\'ve always thought that episode one was always going to be the lamest of the new films so I await the next installment with anticipation and hope .....',\n",
       " 'I know it\\'s fashionable to scorn the \"prequel\" trilogy, but if one stands back a bit, things tend to snap into perspective. Compare \"Phantom Menace\" to most any other fantasy/sci-fi film, and it has to rate very high indeed.Plot: this is the more \"adult\" side of the Star Wars galaxy. The politics are remarkably credible, with the entire plot hinging on the result of a vote of no-confidence! How many adults even know what that is? (Hmm... maybe this explains the low ratings.) The relationships between the races on Naboo, the role of the Jedi... these things are established more clearly, and depicted more credibly than in any of the other five films.Technical achievement: Lucas paints on a vast digital canvas, and creates a world of wonders that have simply never been imagined by lesser talents. This is a living, breathing, believable world, that makes the world of the original trilogy seem cartoonish and contrived by comparison. Naboo, from the city, to the underwater kingdom, to the rolling green hills, is one of the great fantasy worlds, up there with those of the Thief of Baghdad (both versions), Blade Runner, or 2001. And our first glimpse of Coruscant has got to be one of the most memorable \"wow\" moments in the history of the movies.Characters: Liam Neeson\\'s Qui Gon is one of the strongest characters in the Star Wars films, and Ewan McGregor\\'s Obi Wan a worthy, more-dashing successor to the older version created by Alec Guinness. And Jar Jar Binks? Annoying? Not compared to the insipid C-3PO, or the insufferably perky R2-D2. Jar Jar is a fully formed character, with surprising depths. His manner is odd, perhaps abrasive, but he offers far more than the single note that Lucas used for his original comic-relief characters. And, of course, the fact that he is one of the first fully digital characters in film history has to be worth something. But Ian McDiarmid\\'s Senator Palpatine is perhaps the most under-appreciated of all. This is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, a character who is both frighteningly real and perfectly ambiguous. McDiarmid balances his performance on a knife\\'s edge, managing to be both fatherly and deeply unsettling.Yes, it may be that a certain human dimension is weaker here than in the original Star Wars. We don\\'t have a clear \"hero\". There\\'s no Luke, no Han. That\\'s a valid point, but it is not inevitably a criticism. Qui Gon and Obi Wan aren\\'t the comic-book heroes of A New Hope, but they are likable, heroic, and rich in characterization. If I had a choice between seeing 10 more episodes of the life of Han Solo or of Qui Gon Jinn, I\\'d choose the latter without hesitation.Story: The storyline in this film seems more real, more substantial than in the other five. We have the perfect sense of scale, from human drama to global (or interstellar) conflict. The one quibble might be the pod race. It\\'s certainly entertaining, but does it go on too long? I think perhaps so. This is a structural weakness, but not a huge one. (Does Luke spend WAY too long on Dagobah, listening to warmed over Zen platitudes from that rubbery little jerk Yoda? Yes! Yet this is in the film most viewers seem to, unaccountably, pick as the \"best\" of the six. Clearly, there\\'s some latitude for narrative digressions...)And then there\\'s the climactic sword fight. I\\'d rate the three-way duel in Phantom Menace as the second-best sword fight in the Star Wars series, close after the finale of Return of the Jedi. The latter has a wonderful mythic quality, but this one is more visceral, more scary... partly because Darth Maul is such a cold, merciless villain, and partly because you know from the outset that the outcome is genuinely in doubt, that one of the Good Guys really could die. And the staging, using three master swordsmen, each with very different technique... This is just about as good as action film gets. Only two or three other movie duels come close: Rob Roy, again with Neeson, oddly enough; Scaramouche; Robin Hood... I can\\'t think of a fourth. The closing duel ALONE should raise Phantom Menace into the front ranks of action and fantasy films.Bottom line: there is so much to enjoy in this film, so much to see, so much to feel, that it is amazing how anyone can possibly rate it below a 7 or 8. This is a scale of film making that few have ever attempted, let alone pulled off so beautifully. Perhaps that\\'s the film\\'s biggest fault: Lucas makes it all seem too easy.But, of course, we all know the REAL reason people can\\'t give this film the 10 it richly deserves. That reason lies within themselves. Viewers in 1999 (let alone 2007) just couldn\\'t feel as young, as innocent, as optimistic as they did when they saw the very first Star Wars. (Especially if they saw it way back in 1977, 30 years ago). Star Wars hasn\\'t changed, George Lucas hasn\\'t changed, nearly so much as the audience has changed. Alas. Moviegoers who are truly so jaded that they can\\'t feel the passion and revel in the breadth of vision of The Phantom Menace have my sincerest sympathy. Yes, you can be ever so-o cool by putting down the prequel trilogy, but missing one of the best movies of all time is a very high price to pay.',\n",
       " \"Honestly I don't get it why so many people hate this movie I can understand it is a bit too long but its not the weakest in the series, the weakest one in the series would have to be episode 2 Attack of the Clones, having too much romance in it. But I think this one is a lot more better then episode 2 in many ways. And also I think Jar Jar Binks is a rather underrated character I know he can be annoying at times but he did play a large role in this film which fans are missing the point. The pod race is problay the best scene in this whole film as it was rather enjoyable to watch over and over again on youtube. Soundtrack is amazing and very well done for this movie. I know some people hate this movie just because of one character but come on give this movie another chance it will surprised you in many ways. overall Episode 1 is rather underrated and needs another chance 8/10\",\n",

       " \"Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is definitely worth a watch, but I do think it is one of the weaker movies of the Star Wars saga. I will admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative reviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some ways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and technical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special effects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The script is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The action is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray Park is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better. Most of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as Queen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who shone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most part, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams was outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound and direction are also impressive. However, there were things about this film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals, strong music score and good characters, the story never quite distinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did try to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further disadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his performances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do like Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars give unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even embarrassed. And as I said, the pacing is very uneven, there are some slow moments, and one or two scenes felt rushed. All in all, maybe disappointing for fans of the saga, but it cannot be denied that visually it is an accomplishment. 7/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",

If I catch any of the prequels on TV, I will usually leave them in and then sit and watch the end, usually paying more attention to 3 than the previous 2. After watching the much hated on first movie, I found 6 plus points of The Phantom Menace. Liam Neeson as Qui Gon, Duel Of Fates, Darth Maul and his Lightsabre, Natalie Portman gives her best performance in the trilogy, the end battle and even though it ran too long, and he never could have won with all that happened, the Pod Race. I\\'m also surprised no other movie has hit on Natalie Portman and Kiera Knightley looking so alike too.The negatives are some awful dialogue (OK all Star Wats movies have awful dialogue, but this takes the biscuit!!) \"Are you an angel?\" And in fact anything Anakin says, especially during the final battle are especially bad. It\\'s not Jake Lloyds fault, I think he is fine. It\\'s Lucas who have him the cringe worthy words. Speaking of the final battle.... An alleged experienced pilot like Anakin pressed two buttons (starting his spaceship and activating auto pilot) looking for the trigger to the gun, before he actually grabs the obvious control!! Most of the movie is about federation tax (Yawn) there are some serious plot holes (why is technology more advanced than in the previous three movies, which are set in the future?? What happened to the blockade of the planet?? Why were Qui Gon and Padme still with Anakin when they hear about the sand storm) we don\\'t see the Jedi do anything except destroy droids till the end. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused, and it definitely needs some trimming here and there, do we really need all the repeated reaction shots (like when Padme reveals she is the Queen) and one of the biggest sins for me is, Darth Maul is a real bad ass, and they kill him off in the the first movie (and would he really just stand there and let Obi Wan flip over him, instead of slicing him in half??) What a waste. I\\'ll state here I don\\'t hate Jar Jar, mainly because both of my kids were fans of his growing up. So my opinion of him has softened over the years. Oh and Jar Jar actually shoots more droids accidentally, than all the stormtroopers added together in the previous 3 movies.',\n",
       " \"When I was a small kid, I used to wonder what the Star Wars universe was all about. Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi Knights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I watched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George Lucas, the creator of the popular sci-fi saga itself, was trying to accomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And now, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his entire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws. The evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet of Naboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch the two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation Battleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for our heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight face-to-face with thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the annoying yet kind-hearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful Queen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her make-up).  Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is believed to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a cool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match until his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a Naboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!). You need to see the rest of the film if you haven't watched one yet. Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I especially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the wondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To heighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during the climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The Phantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak  (gee, I wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters aren't well developed.  Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will be a major improvement by the time Episode II is released.\",\n",
       " 'The story to SW1 is actually very detailed and interesting. Now I will admit the dialogue is not superb, but the story does flow and leaves viewers anticipating the next sequel. This movie is a backdrop - an introduction of the Star Wars Universe, the Republic, the Jedi, Other characters and the Trade Federation. This is not an easy task to accomplish - explaining to viewers where all the elements of the original trilogy come from. I think people were expecting this to be right up there with the first three, but forgot to realize that this movie is the beginning of the saga..... Viewers also complained about the complexity of the plot with all the politics....my thoughts are that we need to be informed of the fragile and crumbling centre of the republic in order to completely understand the birth of the Empire. But now that this has all been done, I believe that the action will kick into full swing with \"Attack of the Clones\" (Episode II) Check out the documentaries on the Official site.....especially \"trying to do my thing\" Take a look at our next Anakin.....I think we all will be pleasantly surprised with what the next movie has to offer. Anyway my rating for The Phantom Menace is a healthy 8.5/10.Good stuff George. Looking forward to the next one.',\n",
       " 'Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired \"Shark Tale\", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with \"The Incredibles\". And while I have to say that I liked \"Finding Nemo\" a bit better, \"The Incredibles\" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it\\'s funny. It\\'s not so funny that you\\'re constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it\\'s full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It\\'s also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It\\'s full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn\\'t need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a \"hip\" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. \"The Incredibles\" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that \"everybody is special\" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn\\'t be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.\"The Incredibles\", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it\\'s still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.****1/2 of ***** stars',\n",
       " \"The Incredibles is a great film, and probably my favourite Pixar picture (Toy Story is the best, but that's different to favourite). It takes a while to properly get into the action, but when it does, it delivers it in spades.And that's exactly it. I would actually call The Incredibles an animated action film, because to be honest, I don't think there was enough comedy to call it an animated action comedy film. There are quite a few funny moments, but the gags don't come as fast as Finding Nemo or Toy Story.That being said, it does have truly amazing action set-pieces, brilliant voice acting, a fabulous script, wonderful characters and the animation is simply.....well....incredible.The music is definitely a stand-out. It actually made me smile, with it's jazzy tones and James Bond type scores.One of the greatest things about The Incredibles is that it's not a kiddies film; it's completely different to all the other Pixar films. They bring out tommy guns in the second scene, for crying out loud! If you want to see a more adult animated film, then go see The Incredibles, and enjoy every minute. But I wouldn't bring someone younger than 4 maybe, because it isn't really aimed at them, and they probably would find it quite scary.This is a great film, one of the best of 2004 in my opinion. If it just had a slightly higher gag rate, than this would be an absolutely perfect picture.9/10\",\n",
       " \"Is it a bird, no it's a plane, no it's the Incredibles\\x85Imagine if one crazed scientist had a colossal sized blender and put the love and affection of The Modern Family in it, then sprinkled some dysfunctional madness of Malcolm in the Middle and then added superpowers to the mix, I guarantee that what comes out still won't be a match for the crazy, adorable, high octane and utter zaniness that are the Incredibles. The dad is supper strong, the mother can stretch like taffy, and the teenage girl can become invisible and throw up force fields and the 10 year old is lightening fast, which is quiet lucky when they must come up against the rich, genius of the villainous Syndrome, who seeks to destroy the hero he once worshipped in Mr. Incredible and an the whole city along with him. Despite the film being an animation featuring a story line that was extremely fantastical, not once did I remember it was a movie. The actions scenes were spell bounding and highly imaginative. But most importantly, I really believed in these characters that spat witty sharp dialogue at each other at a furious pace, not just because they were funny, but because the characters were so believable and relatable. Subsequently it should come as to no surprise that film was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, which is a rarity for an animated film, but this ain't just your average animated film, it's an Incredible animated film\",\n",
       " \"'The Incredibles (2004)' is a masterclass in character, always putting its central family in front of its superb superhero action. That action is often somewhat counter-intuitively but cleverly conveyed using the tropes and language of the spy genre, giving the movie a decidedly 60s flavour in the process. The piece is a much more mature affair than you might expect, being a family film in every sense of the word - a movie suitable for kids as opposed to one made for them. It is nuanced, affecting and will actually pay off more for the older members of its audience. It plays like a live-action picture with the world's most convincing special effects, since they're rendered exactly like the rest of the flick, and some of the most convincing characters, too. What makes the film so fantastic is that it's genuinely entertaining all the way through. It's properly funny, intriguing, suspenseful, emotionally impactful and exciting. What's so impressive is that it easily rises to the top of its genre, standing amongst the best of its peers (and even, in itself, commenting on them), despite being released when that very same genre was still in its infancy. It stands tall as apparent 'kid' fare that's far more mature than most 'adult' - or, at least, 'teen' - stuff being produced even today (over ten years after its release). It's effortlessly enjoyable and wonderfully conceived. Really, it's just incredible. 9/10\",\n",
       " 'Although \"The Incredibles\" is not the best film Pixar has released (via Disney) since 1995\\'s \"Toy Story,\" I felt it is the most epic. When I went to go see \"Toy Story\" in 1995, the epic scale of the picture -- the non-stop frantic pace, the action sequences, etc. -- were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as, believe it or not, a blockbuster such as \"Terminator 2\": a crowd-pleasing, overwhelming picture.\"Monsters, Inc.\" wasn\\'t quite as epic. It was a great movie, just as good as \"Toy Story,\" but it didn\\'t have the same style per se. \"Finding Nemo\" was very good as well but still didn\\'t capture the same epic scale as \"Toy Story.\" (I\\'m not saying that\\'s a bad thing, just different.) \"The Incredibles\" seemed to. I saw it on DVD and from beginning to end the action is non-stop, the laughs aplenty, and the exotic locations and action-hero references continuous. For this reason, somehow, it reminded me very much of \"Toy Story.\" It seemed like older Pixar, rather than some of their newer stuff (all of which is great as well). Pixar has yet to make a bad movie. Even their worst -- \"A Bug\\'s Life\" -- was better than most animated films.\"The Incredibles\" also returns to the spoof roots of \"Monsters, Inc.\" and \"Toy Story\" (something \"Finding Nemo\" did but not as often) -- it parodies cultural references. (Something hard to do in an underwater sea adventure.) Although this is a family film, it is NOT a \"children\\'s film.\" That is evident from the beginning when the fake news reel in \"The Incredibles\" features articles about a suicidal man suing superheroes because he \"didn\\'t want to be saved.\" This is clearly a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the shameless legal standards of the day. (Such as the woman who sued McDonald\\'s because her coffee was too hot. A true story!) Another film might not be clever enough to integrate iconic cultural references into itself but \"The Incredibles\" does.Similarly, using superheroes, Pixar examines the at-home relationship of a family and spoofs our own rituals. (Such as eating at the dinner table -- the mom tries to stop the squabbling kids just like we do, only because she has superpowers, it\\'s a bit... different.) All in all \"The Incredibles\" really is a great animated film. I enjoyed it more than \"Finding Nemo\" (which I didn\\'t expect to as I loved \"Nemo\") and just as much as \"Toy Story\" and \"Monsters, Inc.\" Pixar has solidified a new style of family film-making -- the cultural parody animated film -- and the evidence of this can be seen in such take-offs of the formula as \"Shrek\" and \"Shark Tale\" (which featured many cultural references as well).All in all \"The Incredibles\" is incredibly fun. And funny.',\n",
       " 'This website has ranked this film to be one of the top 250 films ever made...You want to know something, I totally agree with this verdict!! This high definition surreal film by the master of animation...Walt Disney, evoked a successful culmination of cinematic brilliance on a myriad of artistic production levels!! An accomplishment like this epitomizes the term \"entertaining\" in it\\'s most resounding form!! In evaluating the initial premise of this film, it compounds the dilemma of the proverbial glory days being a thing of the past!! A guy who was a football hero in his school days whereby it was routine to score four touchdowns in a game, and eventually, it fades due to a knee injury or being out of shape or something, this signifies that his best days are over!! When a former head cheerleader who was the starlight of every male\\'s eye, who counted on her good looks, and she loses them, her best days are over as well!! So too is the case of a family of superheroes who leaped through buildings at a single bound in a vigilante crusade to capture nefarious criminals!! Ultimately, their vicarious damage to buildings and citizens meant that the municipality had to insulate itself from any further pecuniary culpability, and relocate them!! This would seemingly suggest that the Incredible\\'s best days are behind them also!! As is the case with so many has beens, the end result winds up being a case of the breadwinner getting relegated to the monotonous plight of an inane job such as an insurance salesman. Such mediocrity reduces the Mr and Mrs to the state of being sedentary and overly mortgaged!! This movie depicts how even a family of manufactured stick people representing the world of fantasy, cannot hide from the afflictions of mid-life crises!!!! The ultimate undoing in these superhero\\'s lives are the non-visceral elements of banality such as; indemnity forms, traffic jams and paranoid nightmares about deteriorating marital trust!! Just as someone wants to be a star football player,or a head cheerleader, all over again, these Incredibles wish to return to their exciting lives as the superheroes who took on capital crime!! Such a plot is very innovative, the writing in this dressed up doggerel of entertainment was remarkable!! This movie has a succinctly homogeneous blend of voices which induce an appropriately heinous cacophony of emotions which effectively illustrate exuberance and despair!! The sound effects were outstanding in this movie!! The cinematography in \"The Incredibles\" was superb!! Middle class hang-ups have been injected into teenage movies and television ever since \"The Simpsons\". This trademark of domestic rancor is for purposes of appealing to a broader audience range!! I found this film to be an ingenious use of satire, while mastering a digitalized analog of intelligent caricatures!! \"The Incredibles\" is not just a kid\\'s film, or an overgrown adolescent\\'s film, it is for everybody!! The family was called the Incredibles, the movie is called FANTASTIC!!',\n",
       " \"When Pixar announced that they'd recruited Brad Bird to direct their new film it was treated with surprise. Sure Bird had been a major part of the Simpsons, he'd been instrumental in creating one of the best recent cartoon features (the Iron Giant) and sure he was a breath of fresh air to the Pixar formula. But why try and fix something that is not only not broken but is positively bursting at the seams with creative energy, commercial viability and critical acclaim? The naysayers, and there were a fair few of them, urged caution and sat back to see if Pixar would make their first misstep after a series of blindingly brilliant films that had knocked their competitor from a perch that had been regarded as impregnable.Disney's misfortune had been our, the viewing public's, great reward. From their childish cartoons we'd suddenly learnt to appreciate and even prefer other possibilities, most specifically computer generated films. Toy Story had come out of nowhere to deliver a killer blow to Disney's tired remakes and uninspired sequels. Ignoring realism in favour of a fun, flexible world where reality existed but didn't automatically infringe on the entertainment, the geniuses at Pixar created a film that didn't try and reinvent the wheel but gave it such an overhaul that the finished product really did look completely new.By realising that people don't like computer generated images, particularly of human beings, which always look and move too perfectly for us to ever accept them, Pixar instead showed us a world of cute toys and giant, fairly irrelevant humans. With the voices incredibly well cast and the images sharp enough to impress without trying to blitz us with colour, Toy Story demonstrated just how excellent CG could be, provided it was married to a good story aimed at kids and adults alike. From there Pixar went from strength to strength, both at the box office and in the reviews. So, again, we must ask: why did they seek the change? We may never know exactly what happened. My understanding is that Brad Bird approached Pixar with the story and they offered him the directing stint by way of reflecting how impressed they were. This rings slightly false in that you wouldn't entrust millions of dollars to a screen writer to make a live action film and the money and directorial duties are by no means reduced for 3D animation. Therefore I think that Bird was given the gig for other reasons, most specifically that the Pixar team were worried that their tried and tested formula was becoming too obvious - mismatched buddies must retrieve something/someone precious from a perilous situation. Regardless, employ him they did and The Incredibles was the result.The Incredibles represents Pixar's best, most adult film and was both a critical and commercial hit with adults and infants alike. It contained all the action and special effects one could wish for, but kept them based around a solid, emotional core of plot, characterisation and witty story telling. Like most, if not all, Pixar films, The Incredibles was designed by adults for adults who were looking to entertain children, rather than by adults looking to exploit children (Disney should take note here and, given that they've recently acquired Pixar, it looks like they've done exactly that). This meant that the film was just as interesting to parents (and uncles) as it was to children, doubling the audience size and making the later, night showings at cinemas just as popular as the daytime ones. In foreign countries, France for example, many of the adults actually ignored the dubbed, local language versions in favour of the original English, for fear of missing some of the brilliant, adult orientated jokes (Bomb Voyage can't possibly have been as amusing in French as he was in English for example).All this comes from Bird's screenplay and it is from there that The Incredibles bursts forth, ahead of the pack. Bird fused numerous, diverse elements to tell the story of a dysfunctional family of superheroes. Mr. Incredible, Bob Parr, is a former superhero forced into retirement, along with all other super heroes, through legal action , an idea I have long considered given how litigious modern society has become. Bob and his wife Helen, the former heroine Elastigirl, disappear to start a family in suburbia.After 15 years and three kids Bob is fast approaching a midlife crisis. Other than helping the occasional client dodge the pitfalls in the insurance company he works at the only fun he has is illegal hero work found by listening in on the police radio network with his friend Frozone, another former superhero voiced superbly by Samuel L Jackson. Bob is heading for emotional meltdown when, through an unfortunate series of events, he finds himself approached with an offer for true heroism...The first half of the film, Bob's emotional emancipation followed by his attempted breakout and its consequences, gives way to the action filled second, which I won't spoil by delving into, save to say that it incorporates more than Bob. There is brilliance a plenty, the jet fight was one of the most tense scenes I've ever experienced, while at no point do you end up seeing action purely for its own sake. Each action has a far more important reaction, not least in terms of emotional growth. Numerous issues are analysed and a very positive message of family, confidence without arrogance and just being there for other people are subtly advocated.All in all I can't recommend this movie enough, particularly as it may well be the last great Pixar film. With Disney's takeover of the company we now have the bringing together of bland, tasteless, star heavy, plot lite films such as Shrek 2, Shark Tale and the like with the genius of Pixar. We can only hope that the heart and minds of the latter win out.\",\n",

Our woe was turned to hope when we learned that it would instead be turned into a TV series. Sadly the good news stopped there. The sets look good and the story seems to be staying loyal to the book (for the most part), but the major downfall is both the acting and the special effects. The acting seems like that of your average high school drama class, lines that need pauses between them are blurted out quickly and with sloppy delivery, even the body language is lacking in any real commitment. While some of the fight scenes look good for the most part the entire feel of the acting, fighting and effects can be easily summed up as power rangers. To touch quickly on the effects, while TV shows have much smaller budgets than feature length movies I feel some effects should have been left out in favour of old school tricks rather than cheap looking garbage. By far the worst part was seeing the Shadowhunters tech, mixing high tech gadgets with this magical world feels like Bilbo Baggins texting Gandalf for advice.If even just the acting improves this show could really impress but for now it's underwhelming to frustrating\",\n",

Removed from the mission by M, Bond nevertheless follows the only lead he has to Miami where he finds himself working round the edges of a plot by criminal Le Chiffre to invest his clients money in the stock market just before an engineered event should send shares in a direction favourable for him.After the poor CGI and overblown (if fun) affair that was Die Another Day, the series was at risk of just throwing more and more money at the screen in an attempt to exaggerate and increase the Bond formula to keep fans happy. And, in fairness it seems financially to be working for them but this is not to say that the drastically scaled back feel of Casino Royale is not a welcome change of direction for the series, because for me it most certainly was. Opening with a gritty, short and violent pre-credit sequence, the film moves through a cool title sequence with a typically Bondian (if only so-so) theme song. The film then immediately marks itself out as a step away from the previous film by launching on a great action sequence that is as overblown as the series requires but yet is all the better for seeming real \\x96 no ropy Die Another Day CGI here. Casting free-runner Foucan was a great move and this sequence was the high for me. After this the film develops nicely with a solid plot that engaged me easily enough, with interesting characters along the way.Of course this isn\\'t to say that the series has suddenly put out an introspective character piece, because the world of Bond is all still here. So we have superhuman stunts, gadgets (albeit a practical self-defibrillator as opposed to a mini-helicopter) and the usual types of characters going the way we expect. Those expecting this self-styled \"reboot\" to provide a depth and emotion that isn\\'t there will be disappointed but regardless this does the Bond formula well \\x96 fans will enjoy it and those that were turned off by Die Another Day will find it a welcome return to darker territory. With all the fanboys tired from bemoaning Craig, it is nice to actually see for ourselves what he can do and mostly he is very good. He convinces as a heartless killer and has the presence that suggests that he could do ruthless damage if he had to. I was a bit put off by how regularly he pouts but generally he brings a gravitas to the character that it benefits from. Green is a pretty good Bond girl and brings much, much more to the role than Berry did in the last film. Mikkelsen is a good foil for Bond and is given more interest by his lack of stature (he is essentially facing his last role of the dice in several ways). Dench is as solid as ever while Wright makes a shrewd move in a small character that offers more of the same for a few years to come.Overall then this is not the brilliant, flawless film that many have claimed, but I completely understand why it has been greeted with such praise. Sat beside Die Another Day, it is a wonderfully dark and brooding Bond with great action replacing some of the CGI and gadget excesses of recent times. Those upset at his blue eyes are best left fuming on the net, because Craig is a great Bond \\x96 capable of being dark with the violence and offering the potential for more if the material comes to meet him. A refreshing film with the bond formula in place but with a dark and comparatively restrained tone that makes it realistic enough to get into while still existing in the spy fantasy world.',\n",
       " \"Casino Royale is a major step-up from the flamboyant Die Another Day. Pierce Brosnan has been replaced by a young-ish Daniel Craig, there is no Q, no campy gadgets, no silly naked women silhouettes in the opening credits, no world-dominating super-colossus villains, no Miss Funnyfanny (or whatever), and no silly one-liners after killing bad guys. Basically everything that can date Bond film very quickly is gone. I never expected international espionage to look the way it has in past few Bond outings and I'm glad someone had the balls to go back to the hard-edged nature of the series, last seen in Licence to Kill.The longest Bond movie so far, at 145 minutes, but it breezes by even though it reigns in on the normally excessive action scenes and depicts spying a more 'mundane' and 'realistic' manner (or at least as true as the series has been so far). But the one-thing that bugs me about action movies, particularly the Bond franchise, is that they are, most of the time, childish male fantasies with an indestructible hero who has fun shooting up the place and beds beautiful women. I would like something new for a change but Casino Royale does have Bond get hurt and go through more pain than he has previously.Daniel Craig got a lot of hassle over his casting as Bond but not only does he have his youth as an advantage (he's the first 30-something to be cast in the role since Lazenby), he's also pretty damn trim, has the intensity Brosnan lacked and is surprisingly loose in a role that usually requires actors to be stiff and unemotional. It's also good to a fresh face in the role and who cares if he is blonde? Or the shortest actor to play him so far? I would have preferred that composer David Arnold went too. They didn't seem to be holding back on the amount of regular production team members who got axed. Even Vic Armstrong didn't return. I've never liked Arnold's work on the movies and I hate to think of it as something that's now exclusively HIS baby.Unfortunately, as good as this fresh start to the franchise was, all of the goodwill that director Martin Campbell earned was completely undone by the follow-up Quantum of Solace, which is not only the worst Bond film so far, but one of the worst action films, and one of the worst films overall, that I have ever seen.If Craig and Co. ever get around to making another, they've got a LOT to make up for.\",\n",
       " 'The famous ultra-violent video game franchise gets a \"Dark Knight\" styled make-over. This is Mortal Kombat revised. Mortal Kombat redone.......as yet another live action iteration of the fantasy fighting game. Originally conceived to be realistic remake which cleverly replacing the more out-of-this-world concepts with gritty real world explanations, MORTAL KOMBAT LEGACY drops that ball right into its second episode where we have mercenaries firing plasma weapons. Two episodes later, we are right back in familiar fantasy territory of other realms, monsters and magic. This is Mortal Kombat rehashed, Mortal Kombat repeated with merely cosmetic changes, and Mortal Kombat recast in such a haphazard way between its two seasons.This web series, originally debuting on the Machinima youtube channel, consists of 6 story arcs over 9 episodes for season one. Season two comprises an ongoing story arc of the tournament plus three origin stories told in flashbacks for a total of 10 episodes. Each episode is so distinct in tone, style and entertainment value that they are almost like mini- movies unto themselves. Two things that permeate the both seasons seems to be director Kevin Tancheroen\\'s indecisive directing style and the annoying music. Tancheroen seems to be copying the style of other directors like Zack Snyder\\'s slow motion speed ramping, Neveldine and Tylor\\'s high speed shaky cam digital photography, and Luc Besson / Paul Greengrass\\'s hyper fast cuts. All these stylistic touches seem thrown in at random and overdone in many instances. Much of the fight choreography for season one is fantastic. But it is done great injustice by Tancharoen\\'s quick cuts, extreme close ups and shaky camera.The first two episodes of season one go into the back story of Sonya Blade, Jax and crime boss Kano presented in a familiar \"Cops and Crime boss\" setting. Sonya is taken prisoner and Jax leads a special forces team to take down Kano\\'s gang. This is a strong start, with a look not unlike modern Hollywood action movies and a realistic gritty tone. Next we get the tale of washed up action star Johnny Cage trying to pitch his latest production. Again, realistic and right in place in our real world, done very creatively in the form of a TV documentary. Now after that, in comes some hokey fantasy. Kitanna and Mileena: a tale of sibling rivalry and teenage identity set among the CGI mountains of Edeina and the dark Canadian- looking woods of Outworld? Our first dud of season one, the Kitanna / Mileena arc spans two episodes but half of the second episode in this arc is a flashback to events in the preceding episode, making the actual runtime of content a lot shorter. Flash animation is used to pad out the story almost like a motion comic.Thankfully the subsequent episodes return to the more realistic setting and more ambiguous fantasy. Take Raiden for instance. How would people, realistically in today\\'s world, react to some dude claiming to be a thunder god? The highlights of the season are of course Scorpion Vs Sub-Zero arc and the final episode about the Lin Kuei Cyborgs. Scorpion\\'s backstory and ensuing vendetta against ninja leader Sub Zero is explained via a beautifully shot period piece, seemingly set in feudal Japan. Characters speak Japanese, authentic Asian actors play the roles, even the costumes seem true to the feudal period. Lastly, the Lin Kuei cyborg segment. This is real eye candy here, featuring cutting edge CGI and motion capture work, creating one of the more brutal bouts in the series. So after a generally enjoyable season one, disregarding some missteps here and there, season two comes around. Season two showcases a little more backstory of other characters like Kung Lao and Liu Kang, as well as finally showing the start of the titular Mortal Kombat Tournament. It may have well been a completely new show altogether as only a couple of returning faces and story elements bear a resemblance to season one. More than half of the roles have been recast with new actors, there are many continuity inconsistencies, the special effects look cheaper, and so do the costumes. For an example of cheapskate costumes and inconsistencies just compare the stories of Scorpion and Sub Zero across the seasons. Season one was simple yet effective, giving a production design of outfits that may have been plausible during feudal Japan. Season 2 reveals that our feudal japan period piece actually takes place in modern day; a modern day where Japan never outgrew its swords, samurais and shoguns and everyone suddenly speaks American English! Season 2 also downgraded the ninja outfits from realistically plausible to ripoff Power Rangers and pyjamas. Lacklustre fights which lack the gritty brutality of the previous season lead up to one disappointing conclusion that is all build up without any payoff.With season three set to veer off into adapting characters and concepts from the recent Mortal Kombat X video game, MORTAL KOMBAT LEGACY\\'s first two seasons ends off on a low note. The episodes of Sonya/Jax/Kano, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Scorpion/Sub-Zero and the Lin Kuei Cyborgs Cyrax and Sektor stand as true gems. Featuring feature film-like production quality and design, brutal fight choreography, as well as cleverly reinterpreting the established mythos in a fresh manner. Downer episodes include the Kitanna/Mileena and most of season two (except perhaps the Kenshi Vs Ermac episodes).',\n",
       " 'Well I wouldn\\'t really call myself a huge fan of the \"Mortal Kombat\" franchise, but I did play the games when I was younger, even got a couple of them for my PS3 today, and have watched the older movies, series and even read some of the comic books. I like \"Mortal Kombat\" for what it is, martial arts fighting without the need to implement a deeper understanding for the reason behind it.However, I will say that this \"Legacy\" series is impressive. Especially compared to the older movies and the earlier \"Conquest\" series. Why? Well simply put because of the production value behind it. It outshines the previous stuff by a mile and a half. There is just a heavier and better feel to this series, it is more in the spirit of \"Mortal Kombat\", if you will.I like how it takes each character and gives you some background behind who they are and what drives them. It is all done in a relatively short period of time in each episode, so of course it is limited just how much background story you get about each character. But so far it has been great entertainment and added some nice details to the characters portrayed so far.As for the acting, well I have been content with the people they have cast for the various roles. People have been doing great jobs bringing the characters alive and believable on the screen. My personal favorites are Scorpion and Sub-Zero, always have and always will be.I find \"Legacy\" to be a well worthy addition to the \"Mortal Kombat\" universe, and it is well worth watching just for the production value behind the series alone. It is really, really great.I sort of gave up on this franchise as a plausible rendering on the screen after the \"Conquest\" series, so it was just by sheer random luck that I came across \"Legacy\", and it was just out of boredom that I sat down to watch it. But after the first episode, I just kept going watching it all, it was just that good. So perhaps \"Mortal Kombat\" can have a glorious comeback on the screen and justify itself after some questionable previous movies and an even less so series. I am excited to find out...',\n",
       " \"OK rebirth exploded onto the scene and i must of watched it 30 or so times i was amazed at this alternate take on mortal kombat which dared stray away from the myth and magic that has made the game so popular, as camp as the original movie was i loved n still love it the sequel was vomit inducing and the TV series i couldn't stomach, but rebirth was like what batman begins was to batman it was dark gritty realistic and bad ass, the fight scene was so well put together and the idea of scorpion rampaging through fight after fight was an interesting idea.OK so then we get legacy after reading the first review i think the user was a bit harsh, but first things first this is nothing like rebirth its gone back to the campness of the first movies and so far nothing has really been shown, its laid the foundations of kanos eye and jax arms but thats it so i don't want to be too harsh as yet, but im still waiting for that wow factor to hit.as yet tho if a movie is to be released i can only hope they follow on from rebirth.one thing i have noticed tho is that this is being brought to us by netherealm studios and it is sorta a background on the characters for the release of the game i can only hope thats what KT had in mind with it and that his movie project will follow rebirth, anyways sorry for my poor grammar lets hope this series gets better and leaves us drooling at the mouth and the first episode is just a slow starter for somethin epic to follow\",\n",
       " 'I have been accused of putting way too much thought into Mortal Kombat. In college, when we were tasked to write our 100+ page papers on movies of (then) the last 20 years, I was told I was stupid to choose Mortal Kombat as my film; and even though I got an A+, they were correct. But still, I love this series. From the Fan made trailer, to the completed project, this has been wonderful. I have gotten so many jaded skeptics of this franchise to be close to tears, or just gushing with admiration over the Season 1 Johnny Cage or Raiden episodes alone. The Liu Kang episodes from Season 2 are heart breaking. Seeing Cary Tagawa BLEW MY MIND.The Scorpion/Sub Zero stuff was worthy of so many lauded Japanese films.This is why independent, and internet films matter.',\n",
       " \"Having really liked/love Matthew Vaughn's previous work, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was one of my favourites from him and was surprisingly brilliant, with only the somewhat tasteless ending disappointing. The follow-up and Vaughn's first sequel has enough of what 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' so good and is an entertaining film on its own but at the end of the day it feels like something is missing.Like some have said already, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle's' biggest flaw is the length, at nearly two and a half hours (much longer than the first film, which was just over two hours) it does feel too long by about 20-25 minutes or so and it does affect the pacing, which drags in place.Especially when it tries to cram in a lot, not everything feels necessary and some of the narrative is on the flimsy and not quite as eventful side. For example Eggsy's excursion to Glastonbury did feel dragged out and didn't serve as much point to the story as it could have done. The first film had more content but wasn't bloated and everything served a point.As enjoyable as the climax was, Poppy's defeat did feel anti-climactic, and Halle Berry is fairly wasted, as is Channing Tatum in what is essentially a pointless plot device role.However, like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has a huge amount to enjoy. It is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes and audacious production design, if just lacking the operatic grandeur of the first film in the action. Once again, the soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.Vaughn does well on the whole directing, particularly on the stylistic elements and making the action as fun as possible. He does struggle maintaining narrative momentum at times however. Very like the first film, he not just achieves the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing, but but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things.Action-wise, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is fun, especially a nod to the original's bar brawl, the snow gun fight, the opening and the deliciously bonkers climax. At the same, nothing is in the same league as the unforgettable church scene and they lack the unflinching grimness. Here, when it comes to the script, nothing leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar, at times, and very witty (like the culture-clash elements), with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny moments. One does wish that the pacing was tighter and the story more consistently gripping.Regarding the cast, they are top notch. Colin Firth returns and does a phenomenal job playing against type, Taron Egerton isn't quite as likable as in the original but one is engrossed enough in his journey (the Glastonbury excursion could easily have been trimmed) and Mark Strong has the ability to turn beneath-him material into gold and he is as charismatic as ever. Pedro Pascal has a Burt Reynolds vibe to him and it comes over affectionately and amusingly.One has to credit Julianne Moore as an understated but played with relish villain and Jeff Bridges once again showing how fine an actor he is. Was pleasantly surprised by Elton John, appreciate him as a singer and his importance in rock 'n' roll but was admittedly expecting him to be a mugging disaster but he sends himself up to scene-stealing entertaining effect.In conclusion, a fun if inferior sequel where one can see why it has garnered fairly mixed reviews but still better than given credit for. 7/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",
       " \"It's essentially all a big joke played on those who took umbrage at the few select sexualised moments from the final act of the first film, a joke whereby everything is consistently ramped up to eleven regardless of its negative impact on the story. This standoffish move is meant to further separate the apparent 'critics' from the so-called 'fans', yet it only successfully provides both categories with a much worse experience. While I and many other 'fans' didn't mind (or at least excused) the passive, clearly satirical crude jests and occasional absurdity of the original picture, we certainly didn't want a follow-up based entirely around what would obviously be considered the weakest aspects of the piece - elements which were only mitigated by the joyous fun found in the brilliance of the subtle yet witty satire and the surprisingly well developed characters. These pieces of the puzzle are now missing. Though it is, at times, passively entertaining, what we're left with is a fairly by-the-numbers 'save-the-world' plot and a string of odd action set-pieces seemingly incompetently put together. There's abhorrent use of rampant speed-ramping that makes things literally look like someone hit the fast-forward button, and haphazardly stitched-together short takes that are supposed to make some sequences look like one fluid shot but instead make them look like cheap cartoons. In his quest to ignore the naysayers, Vaughn disappointingly squanders all of the good-will he had built with his predecessor and bizarrely wipes the slate clean relatively early on, wasting time setting up a less interesting new set of characters instead of working with the better characters already expertly established at the end of the prior title. He also reintroduces a previously dead character (seen in the trailers), after making him an amnesiac no less, in a move that should be reserved only for a waning franchise at least five films in that's struggling to maintain it's relevancy, not for what was once perhaps the most promising new property in Hollywood. 5/10\",\n",
       " 'After loving the first installment, this was just so, so disappointing. The first film was flash but not too flash- walking that tightrope of fabulous to solid plot but remaining coherent with characters we could really dig.Not this film. This film falls off the tight rope and right into the sun.Don\\'t get me started on all of the character development that doesn\\'t happen, blatant inconsistencies and just plain WTF? of this lazy, lazy script.I wont do more than mention the overdose of swaggering Americana- and I do mean Over Dose. (All of the US agents come off as hackneyed fools- except Halle Berry, and the whole movie you\\'re thinking, \"when will Halle get to DO something? Why the heck is she even IN this movie?\")I wont do more than say that Colin Frith just looked extremely annoyed the whole movie, like he\\'d rather be anywhere else - and you can tell why. None of the actors were used to their potential. None. (For that matter neither was the story line.)The action sequences were not even that great, more cobbled together and repetitive, and the one or two good scenes couldn\\'t make me stop just WISHING IT WOULD JUST END. I left the theatre depressed over what could have been and totally was not.',\n",
       " \"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the sequel to the 2015 film Kingsman: The Secret Service. Once again directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, X-Men First Class), it is a solid sequel that contains just as much enjoyment and humour as its predecessor.One year after the events of the first film, the Kingsman's spy headquarters is fatally attacked by an unknown entity. With most of the organisation now dead, the surviving agents Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and his trainer Merlin (Mark Strong) travel abroad to team up with Statesman, their American counterparts, in an effort to bring this mysterious new enemy to justice and save the world once again.Featuring the same ridiculously over-the-top action and unique British charm, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a worthy follow-up to the 2015 film. Matthew Vaughn's slick, fast- paced direction showcases his talent for cleverly choreographed fight scenes and quirky comic relief, which few other directors would be able to replicate successfully. I am hopeful that he returns to direct the third installment. However, similar to Guardians of The Galaxy Vol.2, the film does lack some of the freshness and surprise that was in the original, plus its runtime of 141 minutes does make it drag at times. The cast of characters, both new and old, lend themselves to some highly entertaining situations, including a hilarious performance from Elton John playing a fictionalised version of himself. The real stand-out, though, was Julianne Moore as the film's villain. It's so rare to see her play such an evil character so effectively and so much fun to watch, considering her reputation for usually playing likable roles.I rate it 8/10\",\n",
       " \"This movie feels familiar, and on two counts it is.The Golden Circle is the sequel to the unexpected success story Kingsman: The Secret Service, which was a humorous satire of spy movie tropes with serious undertones mixed in. It knew when to be serious and when to be so serious it was funny. That, combined with some excellent cinematography, made The Secret Service a thoroughly enjoyable film.The Golden Circle has all of these things as well, but while still fun it just comes off feeling like a lesser imitation of the original.Which is where the second count of familiarity comes in: 2017 had another one of these sequels repeat the same formula with lesser results, namely Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Curiously, both original films (Kingsman: The Secret Service and Guardians of the Galaxy) premiered in 2014 with both sequels coming out this year.Now, that's not to say that Guardians Vol. 2 wasn't fun, and The Golden Circle has plenty of fun as well.The film finds the Kingsman on the receiving end of a ruthless Julianne Moore as Poppy, a leader of a drug cartel who wants all drugs to be legalized. Her leverage: her drugs will kill all of its users, of which there are hundreds of millions worldwide. With the Kingsmen's UK resources destroyed, it's up to Taron Egerton's Eggsy and Mark Strong's Merlin to team up with the Statesmen, the US intelligence service featuring Jeff Bridges's Champ, Channing Tatum's Tequila, and Halle Berry's Ginger Ale.There are fast-paced, well-shot action scenes throughout, as with the original Kingsman, the standout being the taxi chase at the beginning. The dialogue is fun, but it hits a few sour notes along the way, especially in its parodying of a certain political figure which comes off as ham-fisted and forced.The pacing of this film is a problem. At 2 hours 21 minutes, it definitely feels too long, especially when there are one too many big set pieces that feel like they should be the stage for the finale but end up being not.Finally, there's a right way and a wrong way to do callbacks to the previous film in a sequel. It's OK to be overt, as long as it's balanced with other, more subtle references as well. Unfortunately, The Golden Circle tends to pound you over the head with callbacks, including literally splicing in footage from the first film in reference to characters who are supposed to be important, but for the life of me you can't possibly remember where they popped up in the first film unless you watch it right before seeing this one.Overall, I would say that there is nothing truly objectionable about this film (although throwing in lots of F-Bombs doesn't automatically equal comedy), but this film may just serve as a reminder of a much more solid film that came before it rather than standing on its own merits.\",\n",
       " 'For fans of monster movies, \"Godzilla\" was surely one of the most anticipated releases of the year. Therefore, the most surprising thing about Godzilla is not how empty the story is, but rather how little there is of the monster in the movie after which it is named.The plot in \"Godzilla\" is disposable. It only exists as an excuse to unleash the film\\'s titular character. However, is it too much to ask for an original plot with characters we could care about? Here, the back story is cliché-ridden and the characters simply serve the function of moving the story forwards. As such, one would expect that Godzilla is at least given ample screen time. Surprisingly, this is not the case, and the majority of the film\\'s focus seems to be on the military attempting to find out how to kill Godzilla and the MUTOs, which look like giant, angry cockroaches. Ultimately, it is left up to the score and the Michael Bay-esque dub-step reminiscent sound design to create tension.Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are so one-dimensional that nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspired script. More worrying, however, is how unnecessary Sally Hawkins\\' character is and how the script manages to make Ken Watanabe look like a second-rate actor, as his character rarely changes expression from the looks of intense thought or surprise. Overall, \"Godzilla\" did not work for me at all. Not only is it a film without heart, but it a film meant to thrill that ends up just being tedious. I could have left halfway through the movie. I just didn\\'t care how things would turn out.',\n",
       " \"This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.Effects are good not dizzying or overdone. The assorted monsters move naturally and are relatively realistic. The various locations from Japan to Hawaii are nicely done too though SanFrancisco could have been a bit brighter during the destruction. The Golden Gate and other landmarks aren't that precise but I get that things had to be spread out to accommodate the monsters.The basic plot isn't needlessly complicated though I got a bit lost in the details with the tactics to kill the monsters and the nuclear link to the monsters. The story about the people is secondary to the monsters which is good as it doesn't intrude.The main character played by a sensitive looking Aaron Taylor Johnson isn't some superhero type saving the day. He is more a in the thick of things observer which is refreshing for a change. No way out bravado here.Elisabeth Olsen isn't a drop dead gorgeous love interest, more every day ordinary. Her screen time isn't that much. Bryan Cranston (why didn't he age?) and Juliette Binoche (who did her hair?) also lend solid support.Ken Watanabe looks right for his part but his diction isn't clear enough for relaying the plot through dialog.Overall it's a good solid and well made big screen action disaster monster movie that deserves a big screen watch.\",\n",

       " 'I saw the trailers for this a year ago while I attended a screening for Aronofsky\\'s NOAH . I didn\\'t fancy it much . GODZILLA conjures up memories of the big budget blandfest from a decade and a half ago . Just put some CGI on screen and voilà you\\'ve a Summer blockbuster . This version did get a very good average rating when it opened , something in the region 8.1 but progressively got lower and it now has a rating of 6.6 indicating something average . To be fair I went in with an open mind and did find myself enjoying things more than I probably expected The original GODZILLA from 1954 was of a course a Japanese film that used the monster as a metaphor for the bomb . It did quickly abandon this subtext and just became a long running franchise where the titular monster got involved in all sorts of battles with other giant monsters . In its favour Gareth Edwards version of GODZILLA does keep the ethos of this . Radiation is very much to the fore of the story and while Godzilla might not be the hero he\\'s certainly not the villain and this is reserved for \"Massive Unidentified Terreistial Organism\" a sort of hybrid between a giant praying mantis and a dragon . You know at one point they\\'re going to be meeting in a climatic battle Of course two hours of giant CGI creatures getting in to a punch up isn\\'t going to resonate with an audience so Edwards includes a very human backdrop as the story takes place through the eyes of serviceman Ford Brody . You got to love that name , it\\'s sounds like a character John Wayne was born to play , a man\\'s gotta do what a man\\'s gotta do , get off your horse and drink your milk etc . It wasn\\'t until I found out after seeing the film that I found out Brody is played by English actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson who I was totally convinced was one hundred per cent Uncle Sam . That said this isn\\'t an actors type of film and I\\'m speculating that the casting of Cranston and Binoche might have led to the backlash by many people . If you want to see Binoche try not to be blink because you will literally miss her . It\\'s also difficult not to notice that there\\'s a strong streak of manipulation as to how the characters play out . It\\'s also yet another film where a little kid is used in a scene to keep the audiences emotions on tenterhooksRegardless of this people watch a film like GODZILLA for action set pieces and you can\\'t really fault Edwards for what he\\'s done here . He doesn\\'t have a idiosyncratic quirk to his directorial style and the film does have that kind of Summer blockbuster look but he also previously directed MONSTERS and that movie featured a couple of aliens mating and here the MUTOs have a similar though much more shorter sequence . If you need a film calling for alien reproduction I can see Gareth Edwards being a natural auteur',\n",
       " \"I'm no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.The film does try to create a human story to ground the audience and it casts wisely with Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe, Hawkins and others – all people who have a good presence in front of the camera. I was not to know that so many of the names that drew me to the project would be removed from the film pretty early on – a device that has impact for sure, but doesn't seem particularly brave since one suspects that the reason people like Cranston got onboard was that they were promised a lot for only relatively small parts. This leaves us with Taylor- Johnson and his quest to get home; a quest that never really interested me but at the same time is constantly pushed into the middle of the action no matter what or where it is. This saw my interest in the human side waning as the film progressed, leaving just the action.On this front the film pushes things as hard as it can. The makers clearly know their action genre because this is a film that understands that soldiers running with guns and speaking in tough military dialogue while music pumps in the background, can grab an audience – so it does it, lots. Considering I didn't care two hoots for them, I was surprised by how much time I spent watching soldiers sweeping areas with guns pointed – it did start to bore after a while. The monsters and their destruction is nicely hinted at first, but eventually the film plays all its cards and we have lots of action and knocking down of buildings. Unfortunately much of it plays out in darkness – something which helps the atmosphere but limits how much can be seen. Technically it looks good and the money is all up on the screen (in the darkness) but it is probably the noise that makes the most impact and even on a lesser system the roars and thuds of the monsters are engagingly meaty.Unfortunately this is really all that the film does, and it is quite uninvolving and unsatisfying. There is a lot of very good noise and big spectacle, but we have to experience through the human characters who we increasingly do not care about, and when the action really ramps up, it is detached from any sort of reality and I found myself appreciating the technical work rather than getting lost in what could have been dramatic and thrilling. As a blockbuster it probably has enough noise about it to be a distracting two hours if you have a good enough home entertainment value.\",\n",
       " 'This review is mainly meant for anyone who watched Fullmetal Alchemist and is either considering Brotherhood, has watched a few episodes and not liked it, or has read one of the negative reviews and was put off.When I first heard about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I was skeptical. Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist? With hesitation and doubt in my heart I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won\\'t lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn\\'t live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show. I cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn\\'t do any of the above because I\\'m exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse\\'s voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic \"in those days, we really believed...\" lines from Al. With each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open. Right around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn\\'t good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don\\'t compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had. If you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better. Therefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don\\'t give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn\\'t miss out.',\n",
       " 'Ill explain why this is the best series ever made and why i feel worthy of judging that.*Note that English isn\\'t my native tongue* I\\'ve been addicted to series for like... forever. I could probably list at least 50 full series I\\'ve seen from all kinds.If i told myself 10 years ago or so that the best series i would ever see was an Anime i wouldn\\'t have believed it.This series made me laugh out loud, cry and bring up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The characters and story are pretty much flawless and there is little to none loose ends. There isn\\'t a \"stormy\" story curve as many series suffer from - where the intro - mid part or ending is to short , to long or rushed. The pace through the entire anime is good.The series does not suffer either from things like to slow riddles-to-answers rate (Lost *cough*) or to fast story.All characters are developed in a brilliant way through the series.Of all movies and shows I\\'ve seen in my lifetime - if i would have to recommend one single series to someone it would be this one without hesitation.If i had an enemy i hated in real life more than anything - even i wouldn\\'t be so cruel as to deny that person to see this show. I could deny them food instead and it would be merciful. Thats how good this show is.One thing that was a major concern early on was that this show would be to childish and silly. Don\\'t be deceived, it is very mature and some elements are even horrifying.This is one of the only shows I\\'ve ever seen, where i haven\\'t been able to personally come up with better ideas on how to make it.Perfection.See it.I also recommend original Japanese voices with English text for best experience.',\n",
       " \"Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.Such was what I discovered when I first laid my eyes on the original FMA series. And yet, for all it's greatness, it began to flounder in it's second season. As many series do, it took on its own form and story, and it was at that point that it started to lose its charm. So, Bones did the smart thing. They remade it. For most series, this would be pointless, but for FMA, it's very much welcome. Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.It's hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren't subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details. These are what make the new FMA an instant new-age classic. Like FMA was the first time around, the new FMA will be one of the top anime to watch out for in the states.\",\n",
       " \"I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric & Roy Mustang and the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it's not as impressive as the first half.The second version (Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) is sticking to manga and has the soul of the original story. It is an all-rounded anime with tightly knit fantastic story, humorous, action packed, dark at times and entertaining. In first half, character introduction, funny moments, action sequence, ends with almost no hope situation for our heroes. In second half, the story takes it's fast pace with more action and nail biting moments.The decisions/resolutions taken by the Elric brothers at each step of their journey are clearly justified. All characters had their importance in the series, even the cute little panda and Yogi had their importance in moving the story forward. Usually when a character is introduced in the middle of a series, it stay far too superior/inferior to rest of the characters. But I like the way Olivier Mira Armstrong and Lin Yao gang introduced in the series.Sometimes when I think of watching something, I start with any one particular scene in this series and ended up watching till the very end of the series. I don't remember how many times I watched it.I have seen many anime in all genre (comedy, drama, action, adventure, thriller, slice of life, bloody ones, etc.) and in my opinion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best in overall. So I give 10 out of 10.When people asks me to suggest something to watch, I recommend this series without blinking. Either they say Animation is for kids or series are lengthy to watch without knowing how Japanese anime differs from Western animation. I would say one thing, watch at least couple of episodes and then you will understand why I recommend this series.Suggestion: The first episode is more of an quick introduction of main casts. The actual story starts in episode 2. So it is OK to skip episode 1. Japanese audio is better than English audio.Other suggested Animes: Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, Code Geass, Steins Gate, Hunter X Hunter, Attack on Titans, Samurai Champloo, Great Teacher Onizuka, Parasyte, One Punch Man (season 1), Boku no Hero Academia, Ghost in the shell (both movies & series, have complex plot), Shigurui (only adults, watch only if you are OK with violence & sex)\",\n",
       " \"After two successful big-budget starring vehicles, we finally get an origin story for Indiana Jones. Of course, that's largely to facilitate the addition of a new supporting character (Sean Connery in a wonderful casting as Indy's long lost father, who we'll get to in just a moment) but that extra layer of nostalgia, wrapped around a property that's deeply nostalgic in the first place, manages to avoid numerous pitfalls and serve as an effective prologue. River Phoenix performs especially well as the young Jones, expertly wearing Harrison Ford's mannerisms throughout the long callback, and somewhere along the way we get a worthwhile genesis for the grown-up version's affinity for leather jackets and fedoras.Once the story jumps ahead to a more familiar era (if not precisely the present), it's full speed ahead on the hunt for the mythical holy grail, a lifelong obsession for the father and recent fixation of the third reich. Soon reunited, both Jones boys dance through precarious situations and near-misses in the history books, a full battalion of Nazi soldiers nipping at their heels, before drawing close to the prize. Ford and Connery are dynamic together, boiling down a complicated father-son relationship to a series of glares, grins and grunts. They alternate between bickering testily and slapping each other on the back in camaraderie, and I honestly can't say which makes for a more entertaining watch. There's depth, too, a stinging blend of long-simmering resentment and earnest care for one another, which often bubbles up just in time to enhance the plot's heaviest moments.Naturally, it simply wouldn't be an Indiana Jones movie without big action sets (in which the series somehow manages to one-up itself yet again) or boatloads of witty retorts and punchy one-liners, and those two essential elements combine to give the film a loose, fun-loving quality without compromising any of the more serious moments. All this without going too far over the top, as we saw more than once in the mildly underwhelming Temple of Doom and borderline-disastrous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's well-written and purposeful, successfully intense and humorous, an in-the-wheelhouse serial-styled adventure that spans several continents before confronting superstition and cracking several dusty, life-threatening riddles on the path to a biblical treasure. Indy probably should've left well-enough alone, because this chapter is essentially impossible to top.\",\n",
       " 'The third and the best of the adventures of Indiana Jones. In this new film, the famous archeologist is searching for a mythical object: \"the Graal\". This is the glass in which the Christ would have drank during the last meal with his apostles. His father assists him in his investigations because he\\'s got precious information about the Graal. So, a long trip begins and will lead our two heroes from Venice to the Middle East in passing by Berlin. You can guess it, this trip has got its rough patches (otherwise the movie would appear devoid of interest). Indeed, the Nazis wish to discover the Graal too because it would make them powerful even dangerous.Steven Spielberg designed his movie like a fascinating treasure hunt and he had the good idea by bringing Sean Connery. Thanks to his presence, the movie\\'s got a certain humor (perhaps a little too convenient but the result works) and allows to lighten the movie.\"Indiana Jones and the last crusade\" is also a good surprise because it wipes out the unhappy memory of the previous movie: \"Indiana Jones and the temple of doom\". I found it too horrendous, bloody and even annoying due to Kate Capshaw. Here, to film Indiana Jones\\' incredible adventures, Spielberg adopted a dramatic and especially efficient film-making. He also avoids all that could make the movie fall in the faults quoted in the second movie. Moreover, there aren\\'t any injury times, the rhythm is skilfully sustained (particularly during the pursuits) and it\\'s better this way because the result is very convincing. Obviously, the movie doesn\\'t go without a few unlikelinesses.Spielberg also brilliantly used the good old recipes for the adventure film: weird and exotic sceneries, the struggle between good and evil, the magic object that possesses supernatural powers etc...The only criticism I have to make of Spielberg is that the screenplay is perhaps well boosted but it doesn\\'t also succeed in hiding a certain manicheism: the Nazis wish to get rid of Jones and his father and to discover the Graal would help them to satisfy their strength.An adventure movie entertaining enough to sustain the interest and rather well performed. Let\\'s add the imposing music (as usual) composed by John Williams.',\n",
       " \"If you love shallow movies.There isn't any depth in this movie. The jokes, story, villains, subplots. It all falls flat. It all one-dimensional. We have a mysterious-looking antagonist named Ghost, but she doesn't have a layer, she can't be mysterious, and at one point she serves up a clot of over complicated exposition that gives the film little bit action. You don't care if she'll accomplish her goal or not. You don't even care which side is going to win. We have lots of jokes, but they're all stale. If you find this humour funny, I'm sorry, I just can't take the movie seriously. While some ''intense'' interrogation scene was going on someone's cell is ringing with a joke sound. And this call is in this movie just because to be there - just because to be ''funny''. It doesn't have any contribution to the story or the storytelling, it just there like that Russian family from Justice League. We have a story that concerns a rescue mission. But there isn't any complexity or twist that blows the audience away. Just flat. You could easily predict what's going to happen next. We have a subplot concerning a romantic relationship between Antman and the Wasp, but there isn't much, it just teases us around, and that's all. We have another subplot concerning a lovely relationship between a dad and his 10 years old daughter, which is not very well developed but still a little bit heartwarming because it's a relationship between a dad and his 10 years old daughter.While a woman who is in constant physical and emotional pain is trying not to die, the movie is trying to be funny. Peyton Reed maybe should've gone for the head, not chest. But then again, he can't, Disney has the strings. It got to try to be colorful, amiable, ''funny'' with forced jokes and fake actings. I really wonder when Marvel and Disney are going to take some risks and make a groundbreaking superhero movie. I guess never. Critics fine with eating the same turd for 10 years.There isn't any climax, or depth, or emotion. Just a filler movie with no heart and soul.PS. Amazing FBI work right there. It was too realistic for this movie 10/10\",\n",
       " 'I love what Marvel have done in the creation of their \"Universe\" it\\'s an overwhelming triumph and despite my fears they managed to slot Antman in there perfectly back in 2015.A heavily comedic character is was heavy on charm, humour and elevated by a fantastic charm. Truth be told I found myself really hyped for the second movie, more than any other (Except GotG).With every cast member both big and small returning a fantastic villian and the one and only Laurence Fishburne, the stars were aligning for another fantastic addition to the universe. And it is................kind of.Regarding the previous films I\\'ve enjoyed them all with the exception of two. I didn\\'t see the appeal in Dr Strange and thought that Black Panther was one of the most overrated movies in the history of the industry.Antman 2 delivers, it does just not to the extent I hoped. Rudd, Lilly and Douglas are excellent once again and the story is fantastic though I think much of the impact of some of the story is highly lacking.Our new villian delivered more than I\\'d ever expected, Pfeiffer was a great addition and Pena managed to annoy me less than usual!The first movie got a solid 7/10 from me and this sequel is recieving the same. What that means is I consider it a good film, it\\'s just not exactly groundbreaking stuff. I feel the movie played it a tad safe and didn\\'t meet its potential.Regardless it\\'s funny, it\\'s action packed and it\\'s likeable and therefore it\\'s another Marvel success in my book.The Good:Incredible castGenuine laughsFits into the universe wellThe Bad:I still don\\'t like PenaSome of the impact was lostBit genericThings I Learnt From This Movie:Lilly is a very clever actress who picks her roles wellSomeone still needs to explain to me how they do that age regression thing sfxWalton Goggins has friends in high placesThe size shifting has all kinds of bedroom possibilitiesTruth serum IS a thing',\n",
       " \"After Avengers: Infinity War I was worried that anything that would come after for Marvel would be underwhelming but I was wrong because AntMan and the wasp used the same formula as the last Ant man movie which was that it was a small story and a family oriented story inside a superhero movie.The Whole premise is Janet Van Dym Hank Pym's wife is trying to get saved from the Quantam while AntMan is underhouse arrest.The story was simple enough and built Aroundt which is why it was so good.The first act was a tad slow but not boring is it set up where the characters are and had some fun action especially with the introduction of the Wasp.The second act was a kind of boring with the pace diping and nothing exciting happening.The third act picked up the pace and the chunk of the action was in the last 30 minutes so that was my favorite part.The villain or antagonist of the movie Ghost wasn't bad but not really that interesting she has a reason to be there but didn't add anything significant with the plot expect for fancy powers which made for good effects.Michael Douglas' performance amd Pual Rudd were the best characters in the movie as they were serious when needed to be and funny when needed to be.The Wasp as I said was cool with as a good enough performance from lilly.Michelle Pfeiffer did well in the role she was given and had good chemistry in the scenes she had with Michael Douglas.Antman and the Wasp was funnier than the first one but of course its Marvel but It had some out of place humor that took away from the serious moments but of course again its Marvel.This had more action as well but mainly in the last 40 minutes or so because as I said the second act was mostly slow and kind of dragged on.So what to take away from all of this is that Antman and the wasp is similar to Back to the Future its funny,has a story with a heart and just a plain fun blockbuster.\",\n",
       " 'In one of the sweetest scenes in \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\", Ant-Man\\'s human persona Scott, played by kind resilient Paul Rudd, sits legs crossed on the bedroom floor with his 10 year-old daughter Cassie, played by cute innocent Hannah John-Kamen. Scott is so sorry for making a mess in his heroic circumstance. Cassie says, \"It\\'s not dumb to help people.\" For Director Peyton Reed\\'s sequel \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" scale truly does matter. In the story by the mini-army of Writers Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari, our Superheroes Ant-Man and Wasp, played by Evangeline Lilly, are not out to save the world, much less the Universe like other Marvel Movies. The scale matters. \"Ant-Man and Wasp\" is smaller, less noisy. There\\'s no threat of global Armageddon. There are spectacular chase scenes in San Francisco with \"Goliath\" Ant-Man, and cinematic kaleidoscope tunneling into the Quantum Realm. Instead the captivating thread is Hope Van Dyne, played by beautiful strong Evangeline, risking her life to find her long lost Mother Janet, played by radiant wise Michelle Pfeiffer, in the Quantum Realm. Paul\\'s Scott, who returned from the Quantum Realm in \"Ant-Man\" holds the key to that possible resurrection.\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" revels in its quirk, not so much in the ostentatious CGI expanding and shrinking effect. Although, the cool martial arts fight scenes with Wasp and new adversary, the phasing Ghost, played by tortured charismatic Hannah John-Kamen, is high impact awesome. Scott unintentionally channels Janet, gifting clues about her location. Scott as Janet holds the hand of her Husband Hank Pym, creator of Ant-Man and Wasp, played by whimsical Michael Douglas. The look on Hank\\'s face is hysterical. As Scott gently caresses Janet\\'s daughter Hope\\'s face, that\\'s the Mother\\'s love. Rudd, Lilly, and Douglas brilliantly play light-hearted, yet never forget that what matters is family. Michelle is sublime gravitas. Too bad the story didn\\'t call for more screen time. \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" begins with Scott under house arrest after his heroics with The Avengers in \"Captain America: Civil War\". This also explains his disappearance in \"Infinity War\". He has nightmares of his stint in the ubiquitous Quantum Realm, while sharing custody of his daughter Cassie. Because of his Avengers debacle as Ant-Man, Scott\\'s now estranged from Hank and his daughter Hope. That\\'s until Hope discovers Scott\\'s possible link to her Mother. Scott and Hope are in love with each other, but not always in phase. So to speak. In this needlessly convoluted narrative, Scott joins forces with Hank and Hope to retrieve Janet. Powerful assassin Eva, also called Ghost, arises threatening their mission. Eva suffers excruciating pain: Her molecules continual regenerate in her phasing curse. Her cure may also resolve in that Quantum Realm. The imaginative movie action dazzles along with the visual effects. Really, it is the personal scale of \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" that resonates. The young woman wants to find her beloved Mother. The husband wants to be with the love of his life. The young daughter believes in her Dad reminding him, \"You can do anything.\" \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is fun exhilarating Summer fare that\\'s also about family and those close. After all: It\\'s not dumb to help people.',\n",
       " \"I know it is kind of late but I just saw Ant-Man and the Wasp yesterday and thought I should leave a review for it. This was a more easy-going and funnier experience compared to the other two juggernauts Marvel brought to us this year. And while it is not as great as the other two, it was an enjoyable experience.The film takes place after the events of Civil War and right before Infinity War. During this time, Scott Lang is under house arrest to be near his daughter Cassie. However, trouble arises when a mysterious character named Ghost shows up, and Scott will have to adopt the alter ego Ant-Man again with the help from the Wasp(Hope van Dyne) and Hank Pym to stop Ghost and fix their problems from the past.The film's plot was rather simple, mostly because the story focuses on the characters and they delivered a plot which is easy to follow, but not too predictable. However, its simplicity also means some parts of the story will feel illogical. Any parts that didn't add up, they will either throw an exposition or the phrase 'Quantum' in there to explain. That's lazy writing.The film haonls many characters and sadly, many of them felt out of place or under-developed. The main reason for this is the introduction of the Wasp. And while she was an amazing she character, she outshone the rest of the cast, including our main protagonist Scott/Ant-Man. Hannah John-Kamen and Laurence Fishburne's charcters were so underdeveloped that I couldn't care less about them. Maggie( Judy Greer) and Jim( Bobby Cannavale) were unnecessary and you can throw them out of the movie without worrying about changing the storyline. But still, kudos to the writers for making such an impressive introduction to the Wasp.As for acting, most of the cast did they part, especially Evangeline Lilly. She is the perfect Wasp and created a great chemistry between Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd is great as always, but I felt like he should have been given more things to do this time around. He was a very smart character in the original Ant-Man, but they made him a complete dummy this time around.The worst part about this film is how they completely wasted the Quantum Realm. There is so much potential , but they just ignored it. I hope they show more of the Realm in the upcoming Avengers 4.All in all, this was a very fun and enjoyble film. Despite some obvious flaws, Peyton Reed did try his best to improve what was not good enough in the first film and helped the film stand out among Black Panther and Infinity War. Recommended for families or those who just want to have a good time in the theater.\",\n",
       " \"Ant-Man and Wasp was a fun movie. Whereas I didn't see it strongly bolstering the MCU, it didn't harm the MCU at all. I like that they gave Ant-Man a partner (I dare not say sidekick) with similar, yet better abilities.Now, as for what I wish would've been different/better: the nemesis, Ghost. Ghost has some excellent skills and abilities which I think they (the production team) could've/should've explored more. I mean, the ability to phase in and out almost at will thereby giving the person the ability to pass through solid matter (kinda like Kitty Pride of the X-Men)--that makes for some spectacular fight scenes and other mischief. I'm imagining a fight similar to the opening scene of X-Men 2 when Nightcrawler infiltrated the White House. I know that phasing in and out is different than teleporting but in tight quarters they can be used similarly.That was my only gripe, which was a small one. Besides wanting more from the bad guy I thought the movie was funny and creative.\",\n",
       " \"Having enjoyed a vast majority of Marvel's superhero output (more so than most) without worshipping them, 'Ant-Man' was a minor effort from them but there was still a good amount to like about it. Despite being positively received by critics, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' as of now has received also heavy criticism from fans and some Marvel non-fans, so was conflicted in seeing it.'Ant-Man' and its slightly superior follow-up 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' managed to be better than expected. 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' to me was not as great as critics are saying, but it is also nowhere near as bad as people here have said, while sharing a few of their criticisms. Do like the character of Ant-Man. He is not exactly a household name and is always tossed aside in favour of other superhero characters like Spiderman that have had longer longevity and perhaps have more compelling origins and stories, hence why they are adapted more. Also wasn't sure what to make of the trailer, which made the film out to be rather bland in story and too reliant on humour while being very well made, directed and acted with thrilling action and funny and clever moments.Seeing it for myself, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' could have been better and has its faults, ones that are somewhat the same as the first 'Ant-Man' and somewhat what was expected from watching the trailer. The script is mostly fine, but has patchy moments, namely the overly-wordy and sometimes over-complicated jargon and inconsistent humour. While the humour mostly works wonders, there are a few instances where it's not so funny and not very well placed.Such as in emotional scenes that are actually quite poignant and heart-warming (more so generally than 'Ant-Man')and then interrupted by a joke that is not only forced and unfunny but also not belonging in the scene, though more sporadically thankfully than before. The family scenes are a mixed bag, sometimes they are sweet and touching, the chemistry is more believable here, while at other times they're a little flat and predictable, contributing towards a few rare dull stretches in a film that generally is appropriately lighter in tone and faster paced.Like many people here, also found the villains underwhelming. Burch is especially pointless and forgettable and only really there because there seemingly needed to be an obligatory villain when actually there could have been just one. 'Thor Ragnarok' and 'Infinity War' only had one major one, and they, especially Thanos were the best villains in the Marvel canon. Ghost fares a little better and is an improvement over Corey Stoll's under-characterised villain in the first 'Ant-Man', her problem was that her back-story was very rushed and didn't feel developed enough. Michelle Pfeiffer is wasted in a very underwritten plot-device role.On the other hand, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is a great looking film, it's beautifully shot, very atmospheric, is very slick and the special effects, are clever and of the usual high-quality Marvel standards. The music avoids being over-bearing, one-note, too quirky or too bombastic, fitting well tone, mood and pace-wise. Direction is more than competent, keeping the story going at a solid pace and the telling of it interesting enough, though maybe a little more flavour may have been more welcome. While the action is not as much as most Marvel films, it is fun, thrilling, nicely choreographed and tautly shot and edited, especially towards the end. The stuff with sizes was clever visually and interested and entertained while the film is better than a lot of sequels in being consistent in the continuity.There is some very smart and hugely entertaining scripting and dialogue here in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' too. While it doesn't work completely seamlessly, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp's humour when it works is some of the funniest stuff of all Marvel films, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously or too much of a joke either, instead not being afraid to embrace the silliness and humour while ensuring still that the subject matter is treated with respect. The truth serum and the feminine side being brought out parts were hilarious. The story is mostly diverting, it's and the first 'Ant-Man' film are narratively simpler than most Marvel outings and less risks here are taken than most Marvel films but it always makes sense, moments of dullness and jarring are few (while not being completely absent either), it's fun and it doesn't try to do too much or try to insert too many characters.While not complex as such, the characters are mostly engaging, with the reservations being with the villain and Pfeiffer's character. Paul Rudd is a strong and hugely entertaining lead, while Michael Peña's hilarious in a role that could have been really annoying. The seasoned support of a distinguished Michael Douglas adds hugely too, and Evangeline Lilly and Abby Ryder Fortson give the film some much needed heart. Hannah John-Kamon does command the screen and Walton Goggins has an oily presence that is more than what the forgettable and useless character deserved.Overall, not one of Marvel's best and has its flaws but a good sequel and film with many great things. 7/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",
       " 'So I think I can officially say it this time:This is the first Marvel film I can undoubtedly say I thought was bad. VERY bad, as a matter of fact.Let\\'s start from the beginning; I enjoyed the first \\'Ant-Man\\' film. It\\'s not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. It reeks of re-writes and five different people working on its script. That said, it\\'s imaginative and fun and I can at least roll with it and find it amusing at its worst lows and creative at its highest highs.But this...this...this just felt like it was there to just be \\'there\\'.The characters: Paul Rudd is Paul Rudd. That may sound like a joke, but in all honesty, I have trouble finding a character in Scott Lang beyond \"Paul Rudd\". His character lacks any real depth, and I find it a struggle to truly care for him by the end of this film or even grasp onto a new development of his character that resulted in his film. He gives off the AIR of being likeable, and I DO like Paul Rudd\\'s performance in this, but other than that...he\\'s an actor playing himself. I don\\'t see \"Scott Lang\". I see \"Paul Rudd\".Michael Douglas? Again, I LOVE Michael Douglas as an actor, but...he spouts technobabble, we\\'re left confused as to what it all means, and we end up just seeing Hank Pymm as a dispensary of science talk and lacking a character. This entire film is about him and his quest to find his wife...yet we never get anything intimate for his character beyond a scene or two (Which are played for laughs anyway, so who cares?).Evangeline Lily and Michelle Pfeiffer, however, suffer the most here. Never have I seen such flat female characters in a superhero film since the mid-2000\\'s of half-baked Marvel adaptation films. Hope Van Dyne is positioned as such a vital character in this film (Her character\\'s name is IN THE TITLE), yet she feels completely jammed into a \"Badass girl who kicks you\" stereotype with little-to-no depth. For a character who we were \"promised\" would be vital to this film, I know very little about her beyond what I already knew from the first film. Pfeiffer suffers just as much, as she too is treated as only the role of \"Woman who must be rescued\". We get no development of her character as they search for her, no characterization, no scene that at least gives us an idea of what she was like or what she did. But what development we DO get is expressed through some truly awful sequences where the events of the first film are needlessly recapped, character backstories are flipped through and swatted-away just so the writers can say they included it, and take away any and all depth that could be explored with these characters.Instead, everything is FLAT. And I think that word describes this film perfectly. \"Flat\". \"Flat\" is what the characters are. \"Flat\" is the cinematography and lighting of the film that looks like any other cut-and-dry comedy film with no inventiveness or seeming effort to make this look creative. And \"Flat\" is how the humor of this screenplay falls. For the thousands of swings this film takes at humor, it lands it about 20 times, and misses all the rest. The theater I was in was awkwardly quiet, simply because it was trying TOO HARD to be funny. The wit of the first film worked far better in that it didn\\'t need to TRY to be funny.  Instead, we have Michael Pena and Paul Rudd\\'s heist friends rambling in scenes that feel improved and landing no jokes whatsoever. Other than a few scenes that were indeed humorous and garnered a big laugh or two from the audience and myself...clearly, the audience wasn\\'t feeling it.And neither was I.In addition, the editing for this film incited a rare reaction of mine where I felt total whiplash in a jump from one scene to another. Quite literally, one transition from a scene to another was the most jarring and disjointed thing I\\'ve ever seen, and it left myself and my girlfriend audibly asking ourselves in our theatre seats if we just missed an entire scene. Not good at all.All that considered...I didn\\'t absolutely hate every aspect of this film. The action scenes where they play with size are still mildly interesting, although even they can\\'t save this film as they lack the ambition and creativeness that the first had. Paul Rudd is entertaining enough as...Paul Rudd, and even a few scenes involving Michael Pena and his friends elicit a chuckle or two.That said...I can\\'t help but feel this film is an utter mess. A mess of mediocrity, poor editing, poor character writing, 2-3 action scenes that are nothing beyond \"Serviceable\", and attempts at humor that throws the entire buffet at you...but in the end, you only end up with empty calories.And that\\'s how I feel about this film. Empty....+1 whole point for that Tim Heidecker cameo, though...',\n",
       " 'SPOILER: Following the unexpected and shocking moments from \"Avengers: Infinity War\", fans eagerly awaited the next Marvel Studios film for any type of clues as to what will happen next when the next Avengers film arrives next summer. \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\", is set before the events of \"Avengers: Infinity War\", and finds Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) under home confinement thanks to a plea deal he took for siding with Captain America in \"Captain America: Civil War\". The years of being at home have driven Scott to find creative ways to entertain himself when his friend Luis (Michael Pena) and his daughter Cassie are not around. Scott is nearing the end of his isolation but knows F.B.I. Agent Woo (Randall Park), is waiting for him to slip up and with a possible twenty year prison term in the balance, he is not eager to make any mistakes.\\nScott is also on the outs with Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and her father Hank (Michael Douglas) as it is revealed he took the Ant-Man suit and took part in the Civil War without their permission.Fate intervenes when a strange dream causes Scott to contact Hope who in turn takes a reluctant Scott along with her to get to the bottom of the dream. Scott is naturally reluctant as he is days away from freedom and being discovered out and about and consorting with his wanted former associates would not be good for his eventual freedom.A shady tech dealer named Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) and a dangerous new adversary named \"Ghost\" (Hannah John-Kamen) also complicate matters and force Scott, Hope, and Hank to contend with issues all around them as the race against time on an urgent mission while trying to stay away from Woo and his team.The film is a bit slow getting started but it does have some great character moments as well as humor around the build-up to the action sequences. The action when it comes mixes some great visual FX with some humor as Hope and Scott jump between everyday items at various sizes to face the threats presented to them. The cast works very well with one another and there are some great moments that will likely become favorites for fans of the characters and Marvel.The Ghost is a rather interesting choice as an adversary as we do not have an individual bent on conquest, revenge, mass destruction, or accumulating power and wealth. While it may seem odd to have a more down to earth and relatable villain in a Marvel film, it does continue a recent trend of showing of adversaries who are complex, harder to define, and sympathetic much like The Winter Soldier.There are two scenes in the credits which are very important to the continuity of the Marvel Universe and with \"Captain Marvel\" due in March 2019, it will likely get fans whipped into overdrive thinking about the possibilities they present.\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is not as epic in scale as some of the past Marvel films, but thanks to a likeable cast and some timely humor, it should keep fans happy until the next chapter in the series.4 stars out of 5',\n",
       " 'Unlike in most of the franchises where the third installment is the weakest, MCU happens to be consistent in making the second installment the weakest one, except for \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" (2014). \"Ant-Man and The Wasp\" is a continuation in the legacy. It was mostly vague, and almost a total crap. It doesn\\'t try to be anything more than a filler. To be honest, it felt like a dumbed down version of \"25th Hour\" with a lighter tone featuring some superhero characters. It simply aims at being a movie with some little fun stuff but being disposable on the whole. Both of the major plotlines - one involving Ghost and the other involving Sonny Burch felt just like something that was there to help the plot go further. The characterization of Ghost and Burch have no depth in them. Burch is totally shallow and one dimensional and generic. Ghost has a little backstory, and isn\\'t enough to get behind the character. The motives which drive both the plotlines are totally clichéd and thinly built. It felt as if they thought \\'Ghost isn\\'t a good villain, let\\'s distract the viewers by giving them the other plotline\\'. This created an \"Iron Man 2\" level of multiple plotline mess - a little less interesting. Ant-Man is a sidekick in this movie. From someone who could bring about a well planned heist to a doofus - with no explanation. Giant Man plays into the story, but it\\'s more for slapsticky purposes. Also, the original Wasp gets some powers in the Quantum Realm which are not even explained by this movie. Surely, it might be explained in future films, but it could\\'ve easily done that. Lawrence Fishburne feels like a wasted talent in this movie. It seemed like a promising character, but turned out to be the same old \"good guy in the bad guy\\'s side\" character. One good thing about this movie, besides the cast, is the deaging CGI. It looked awesome. To me, it felt like Michael Douglas from the 90s with just a different hair and almost similarly with others. Father-daughter dynamic between Scott and his daughter was likeable. To sum it up, I must say that it was way below my expectations. It\\'s not that I have watched an impactful and emotionally craving \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and I wasn\\'t in a mood to watch something so less impactful. I knew it wasn\\'t going to be a spectacular as IW but neither did I expect it to be so much of a mediocrity. It\\'s not that the aftermath of IW has holded this movie down. After a long time, it will develop the same legacy as that of \"Iron Man 2\", at best. I wonder how the same critics who panned \"Justice League\" (2017) for having a thin plot and creating a mess gave it a thumbs up. As someone who likes \"Ant-Man\" (2015) and considers it to be the most underappreciated MCU movie till date, its sequel was mediocre at best. I thought \"Black Panther\" was going to be the worst MCU movie of 2018, but I was wrong. It\\'s \"Ant-Man and The Wasp\".Score : 4.1/10Grade : D+Label : Disappointing',\n",
       " 'Even though I enjoyed the first one as a comedy movie itself (and not a hero movie, more like an \"introduction\" movie into becoming some sort of hero), it was \"ok\" for me the fact that they inserted a very generic, uninteresting, forgettable villain in it (by now we always expect this kind of villain in MCU introduction movies).Well, this time they expanded the team into Ant-man + Wasp, which was nice. But that was the only main change (besides the after-credit scene). They still managed to create the same structure of the previous movie, instead of a \"hero movie\"...again a comedy movie... instead of a well developed villain, again the same uninteresting and forgettable villain.Personally I think I lost money watching it since it was again more of the same, maybe I have should waited until it was on Netflix or something.',\n",
       " \"Ant-Man and the Wasp takes place after the events of Ant-Man(2015) & Captain America: Civil War(2016). Scott Lang/Ant-Man(Paul Rudd) teams up with Hope Van Dyne/Wasp(Evangeline Lilly). With the help of mentor Dr. Hank Pym(Michael Douglas), Scott & Hope have to work together to discover something crucial, that will unravel secrets from their past. Ant-Man and the Wasp is an awe-inspiring film. Director Peyton Reed has maintained all the quirks, gags, one-liners & unique action, that made Ant-Man(2015) such a thoroughly enjoyable movie. The visual effects are magnificent. The 3D(especially in IMAX) puts you right in the middle of the action onscreen. The action set pieces are mind-blowing, with the stand out being the climactic one. The performances are the highlight of the film. Paul Rudd is spectacular as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Rudd exudes his natural charisma & wit in his portrayal. Evangeline Lilly is outstanding as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp. Lilly's 'no-nonsense, always gets the job done' character perfectly complements Rudd's more goofy character. Paul Rudd & Evangeline Lilly share electrifying chemistry together. Michael Pena is hysterical as Luis. Walton Goggins is great as Sonny Burch. Bobby Cannavale & Judy Greer are good as Paxton & Maggie, respectively. Tip 'T.I.' Harris & David Dastmalchian are impressive as Dave & Kurt, respectively. Hannah John-Kamen is brilliant as Ava/Ghost. Abby Ryder Fortson is adorable as Cassie. Randall Park is superb as Jimmy Woo. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as Janet Van Dyne/Wasp. Laurence Fishburne is effective as Dr. Bill Foster. Michael Douglas is awesome as Dr. Hank Pym. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a must watch. Another flawless Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.\",\n",
       " 'Alright, i have seen quite a bit of negative reviews on here. but while reading through those reviews, i noted a couple things.\\n1) people don\\'t understand that this is SUPPOSED to be a comedic movie. the reason why \"serious\" scenes are interrupted by some joke or punchline is because it\\'s not supposed to keep the audience tense and on the edge of their seat. \\n2) people don\\'t understand the heart of who ant-man is. he\\'s not some valiant superhero like captain america or thor who can knock out an opponent with one punch or flick of the wrist. he is first and foremost, a father. what drives him is his relationship with his daughter, so yes, a lot of the film is centered around that. but i think this adds a special element to the film that most other superhero movies do not have. scott has a lot to lose and a lot to motivate him, other than just \"being a hero and saving the day.\" he has a family. scott is also not a professional superhero. yes, he is ant-man and has experience with the suit, however, he does not have the resources of shield or tony stark at his disposal so he cannot simulate advanced training missions and whatnot all the time. in fact, he is under house arrest, so he can\\'t do anything superhero related anyway. and that is why scott is dependent on other people and why it is not called \"ant man 2\" but \"ant man and the wasp.\" hope van dyne plays a key role in this film, not just acting as a love interest. she is a hero in her own right and is more experienced than scott.\\n3) the negative reviews forget about the gripping and thrilling action sequences in this film. it is a marvel movie after all and lives up to its name with all the fight scenes and car chases and special effects. i think all the characters in this movie were key to the plot, it was engaging, and a very fun movie. i enjoyed every minute of it.',\n",

       " \"As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.\",\n",
       " 'For those that know only of the original comic book Hulk, the TV series Hulk, or the regrettable Ang Lee Hulk, you should know that this new version is a mixture of origins.Without spoiling it, one of the larger ingredients in this new Hulk comes from a Marvel series that is an alternate universe. There are many differences in the Ultimates Universe. In this version, Banner did not get his gamma radiation from exposure during an experimental bomb explosion. I won\\'t spoil it, but you can go to www.marvel.com and look under \"Ultimates\" if you wish to get the gist of it. I can truly say that this version captures a little of everything, so that no matter what your knowledge is of the Hulk character, there\\'s tie-ins to everything.Personally, I felt this reboot was well thought out. It allows for any future connectivity by not limiting it to one version of the Hulk. This will allow future Marvel movie-makers the ability to pick and choose aspects from the multitude of alternate universes, re-tellings, and time spans to combine whatever they please.This was well cast. When the overall product can make me forget the fact that I don\\'t like a specific actor, and truly appreciate the total entertainment experience, it\\'s something to smile about. I won\\'t mention which one I don\\'t care for, since all that will do is spark useless debate.Story - intricate and intelligent, fast-paced, yet deeply explanatory, complex, yet easily taken in by non-geeks. Enough references to the true comic, alternate comic, and TV show, that everyone in the sneak peek seemed to be pleased. I surely was.CGI was great. Don\\'t know why some have to nit-pick, but you can\\'t please everyone, I guess. Action was wonderful with plenty of it! If you\\'ve ever read one of my reviews, you\\'ll know that I\\'m a true fan of overall entertainment. While I have favorites, I don\\'t base reviews on just one actor, writer, director, production company, genre, or whatever. So, if you don\\'t like my opinion, so be it.',\n",
       " \"The Incredible Hulk, based on another marvel superhero and also the 1970s TV show, revolves around Bruce Banner becoming a fugitive after his science experiment exposes gamma radiation on him which transforms him into the Hulk which becomes his appearance for brief periods of time. Meanwhile, General Ross and his army including Emil Blonsky tracks down Bruce and little does he know that Emil decides to use a serum that would give him some abilities while also transforming him into an even worse creature imaginable.Out of all the MCU films I've seen, the one that didn't make as much money compared to the others is this. Which is a shame because this is directed by Louis Leterrier, who would later direct the terrible Clash of the Titans remake, Now You See Me, and the recent TV show The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (which I severely liked). And the acting from everyone involved is good. Edward Norton does a great job as Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler from The Lord of the Rings trilogy does a good job too as Betty as did William Hurt and Tim Roth and Tim Blake Nelson. Sure, the villain could've been developed more and the second act of the film could've been better, but everything else is done very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, the pacing is decent, the editing is superb, the music from Craig Armstrong is rousing, and the action sequences are solid.So, overall, this isn't a perfect film by any means but it's way better than the 2003 version (which isn't terrible but could've been much better). To those who have seen most of the MCU films or not, certainly give this one a go. :)\",\n",
       " \"Three cheers for Marvel for finally realizing that no one knows their material better then themselves. May they never sell another beloved superhero to a lesser being again.For the second time this summer Marvel has given us a superhero movie that just plain rocks. With the exact right amount of humour, character development and great action sequences, the Incredible Hulk is up there with Iron Man as one of my favourite films to be released so far in the summer movie season. While I didn't like it quite as much as Iron Man (Robert Downey WAS Tony Stark. Whereas something still doesn't sit right about Edward Norton as Bruce...) it was nevertheless a great, faithful adaptation of the comic books. Plus the cameo appearances by both Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr where terrific! Possibly my favourite Stan Lee cameo yet.There isn't really much else to say besides, go see it for yourselves. If you're a fan of the comics, or just of fun popcorn films you'll definitely enjoy this one.8/10\",\n",
       " 'The crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro provided some reminiscence of Jackie Chan\\'s Police Story, where you could be sure of a chase scene zig- zagging the streets to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities presented for an exhilarating chase. And Leterrier doesn\\'t try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.While there will be those who will gripe about the transformation mainly done in the dark and in shadows, it does prove to be effective in building some anticipation and heigntened tension as to when he will finally appear in full glory. The mainly military attacks on the big guy again brought out some back to basics adversary with Thunderbolt Ross trying to capture the Hulk, and in fact I\\'d appreciate that this movie didn\\'t divert too much away from this primary objective, although it might be more of the same from the first movie. But while the Hulk has an aura of invulnerability, somehow The Incredible Hulk provided me at least, an emotional pang when he gets hurt bad, as we remember that this is a guy who just plainly wants to be left alone. And the angrier the Hulk gets, the bigger and more powerful he becomes too.And it\\'s not all serious here too, with well meaning humour peppered in the right places, making numerous references to the television series and characters from the Marvel universe. You\\'d often wonder how his pants stay on before-during-and-after transformation, well, it gets addressed here with humour. Memorable ines such as \"don\\'t- make-me-angry-you-wouldn\\'t-like-me-when-I\\'m-angry\" gets punned away, even the late Bill Bixby got a cameo, together with Lou Ferrigno who reprises his security guard role, and Stan Lee who\\'s possibly in the most unmemorable cameo appearance ever. The much touted Tony Stark appearance will bring whoops of joy from newly converted fans of Robert Downey Jr, while I suspect in line with the rumoured Avengers movie, the universe now seemed more streamlined again with the references to SHIELD, and stupid me thinking that Mr Fantastic would somewhat be featured in this too. A WWII super soldier project and serum was referenced and formed the basis for Tim Roth\\'s Emil Blonsky turned Abomination, but Captain America? I\\'ll leave that to you to find out.But what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk is not the action sequences, nor the references mentioned made. It was the central love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. In Lee Ang\\'s version, we don\\'t see much of the romance between Bana and Connelly because the story didn\\'t really call for it, save for a rescue scene, and at an in-juncture where the Hulk was stopped in his tracks by his lady love. And that was precisely the winner for me. The Hulk, for all his power and unstoppable rage, could be brought under control by his lady love, and that was used to great effect here. Beneath the green invulnerability lies the heart of a mild-mannered man who yearns to be with the love of his life, but unfortunately cannot due to the curse that Fate had brought upon him. Both Norton and Tyler managed to bring out this chemistry of lovers torned apart, one who can only admire the other from afar, and the other finally never wanting to let go of someone who had disappeared from her life for her own protection. And this version of Betty does sport a bit of a temper and feisty too, and is not really your classic damsel in distress.Granted that most supporting characters were rather one-dimensional, The Incredible Hulk somehow managed to straddle between its intense whack-all-destroy-all moments, and tender ones when the lovers are left alone to their own devices. As with the Marvel movies to date, the doors are left wide opened for follow ups and team-ups, and here there are no less than three avenues where the next story could develop further from, and sowed the seed for other movie franchises to be developed too. It drained a little bit from the cerebral department in order to amplify the romance, and let the action go into overdrive. HUlk Smash indeed, this time likely to make a huge dent at the box office, for fans and non-fans alike to be won over, just like how Iron Man did.',\n",
       " 'By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee\\'s Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn\\'t a bad movie but wasn\\'t even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk\\'s originWhen I saw the trailer of The Incredible Hulk I was like \"Wow this movie looks cool\" and it lived up to my expectation also the trailer did not give too much away about the plot. The film was outrageously entertaining, fun and a perfect popcorn movie. It is the same director of The Transporter 2 so it is bound to have good action. You can see every penny spent from the $130 million budget. It is roughly (not exactly) the same amount as Hulk (2003) and The Incredible Hulk looks much, much more expensive.The story is about Bruce Banner who is trying to cure is condition that turns him into a monster but is going to use it as his weapon against the Abomination. The plot may seem simple but it is better that way because you can just concentrate on the action and the monsters.This time the Hulk is more darker and sinister looking and is more muscular than Ang Lee\\'s Hulk. The Abomination was the icing & cherry on the cake and I\\'m glad that they had a proper villain this time. His name really does match his personality and he is not wearing any underpants, so girls you might want to look away otherwise you might get a fright. Overall this movie is Incredible not an Abomination.',\n",
       " \"About 1100 reviews on the old IMDb and I am going to do something I have never done before -- review on a bell curve.Seriously, before you start listing all the things you DIDN'T like, ask yourself how many live action Hulk movies have there been outside of the Avenger ensemble acts? Answer: Two. Only two. Just two.And the entry from Ang Lee was so wretched, so horrific, that this one gets a push up the curve.It is actually a solid film. Roth makes a great villain. Tyler was a great love interest. (The scene where Hulk becomes a giant fire extinguisher is one for the record books and memorable). And Norton is arguably the highest-level A-lister to ever play the role.(Or, also arguably, to ever play it again -- notice he was gone from the Avenger movies. Also notice that the two solo-Hulk movies did so poorly at the box office that this one actually ends with a promo for the coming Avengers, suggesting that the suits at Marvel are no longer interested in gambling on Hulk in a film by himself and all your future Hulk movies may be of the animated variety).All done, this is a much better film than the reviews would suggest.\",\n",
       " 'I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee\\'s 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier\\'s 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee\\'s film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.One issue I had with Lee\\'s 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn\\'t necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn\\'t really grab me. Letterier\\'s film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk\\'s fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn\\'t even compare to the Hulk\\'s battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn\\'t see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.In general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must\\'ve given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would\\'ve put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).It\\'s great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they\\'ve done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn\\'t on par with 2008\\'s Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic.

Leterrier's Incredible Hulk has all of the watered-down clichés you've seen a million times before, so it's all comforting to know that there's nothing new to shock you with, and challenge your brain.Motivation for the villain not your cup to tea? No problem! There is none in this movie. he just looks mean and smashes things.Tired of Hulk transforming when he's angry for various reasons, and tired to figuring out what those reasons are (oedipal complexes!?! boring!) - Look no further! This movie has the simplest Hulk motivations! In fact, Betty is in peril so often, you can make a drinking game out of it! And who hates the military? Tentpole movie audiences, that's who! With their evil plans and reckless decisions! It's so simple! So sit back, relax, and forget that moody talking movie with their complex characters, well-formed narrative structure, and other conceptual ideas you don't want to have to think about, and enjoy Leterrier's Incredible Hulk. It's just like Ang Lee's (without all that brain stuff)!\",\n",
       " \"Precursor: I just moved back into town two days ago and had made plans to see one of my old friends tonight. I did not want to see this movie, and wouldn't have under any other circumstances but my friend really wanted to and the tickets were free so I went. Review itself: This is of no disrespect to Jonah Hill, his fashion of humor or his fans at all, but I, personally have grown tired of what seems to now be a plethora of wanna be Hangover and Superbad's. (The success of Project X seriously worries me...). Anyways, having that mind set approaching tonight and considering the fact I didn't laugh once during the 21 JS trailer, green or red band... I really wasn't expecting all that much out of the experience aside from leaving the house and catching up with a buddy. But damn. I honestly thought this movie was great. Yes, there were parts I wasn't fond of... a bit of the dialogue seemed to me to be vulgar strictly for the sake of being vulgar... there was the usual expected Jonah Hill trademarked myriad of penis jokes and one extremely unnecessary shock gag but the majority of the movie was, to me, surprisingly satirical/smart/relevant in today's society, self-aware, and situationally hilarious. Even the dumbest and most profane of this movie's jokes and clichés seemed to know that they were such and were given the proper comedic build up/context to at least warrant a chuckle. This movie had some surprisingly clever dialogue throughout and some of the best supporting characters I've seen in recent comedies (Ice Cube, The Principal, etc..) What really stood out to me though was the editing. 21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly humorous camera shot transitions, scene changes and music integration. Despite it's faults, I found this to be a damn hard movie to hate, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun weekend movie.All in all... genuine, clever, vulgar yet respectable comedy with some heart. IMO a very good career move for both Hill and Tatum. Stoked for the sequel.\",\n",
       " \"Buddy cop movies have been losing their waves. The thing is that all the buddy cop movies after Rush Hour 1 have been either too dull to comprehend or just mildly interesting and could just pass as a movie you've seen just to mark the register that you've seen it.Based on a TV series of the same name which aired on Fox Network between 1987 and 1991, the series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. The 2012 movie adaptation also had the former cast of the series; Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise play a minor role.Written by Jonah Hill who also starred in it, 21 is a movie that suits a cinema viewing with a box of popcorn at your side. Hill's performance was on a mild okay side, but the main cheese in the movie was Channing Tatum, who transcended from a jock to a nerd and still maintained his persona. I guess the most fun I had was when I saw Ice – Cube talking to the duo.The movie was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). The directors and writers made sure you didn't have to go see the original to get the full taste of 21, as the film made do of the current pop culture in our time and how ironic and dumb it looks to make a fun movie and enough juice left to make another.21 makes fun of everything in its path, even down to drugs, and how we kept expecting things to blow up and they just don't. The jokes keeps coming in from every corner making you laugh although.The high moments in the movie was whenever the duo were together, the low moment was when they were apart.The plot had the duo Hill and Tatum as Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko (respectively), get deployed as undercover cops to a high school to bust a drug ring, and everything you'd expect to happen, doesn't. That's the fun of the movie.All in all, why are you wasting time reading this go watch it.\",\n",
       " 'So if you like Jonah Hill and comedies with really great cameo appearances, I think you would definitely like this film.I must admit I expected this to be at the same standard as maybe The Change-Up or The Hangover Part II which weren\\'t terrible movies, but they weren\\'t the funniest movies I have seen either. This movie is more on par with The Hangover (the first installment), Superbad and Anchorman.The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and it\\'s nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com or \"rom\" setting. I was already laughing from the first scene, which is generally hard to do and the humour was the correct balance of wit and slapstick. There were actually a lot more clever jokes than I expected and there were some scenes were I couldn\\'t even control my laughter in a full cinema.All in all, I\\'m not saying this movie is for everyone but the way I would tell you to see it is if you like Jonah Hill\\'s ridiculous dialogue with sometimes unnecessary swears and you have no expectations of it being anything like the original TV show, I would definitely recommend this one! Best comedy film I\\'ve seen at the cinema in 2012.',\n",
       " '21 Jump Street sounds like a terrible idea on paper: a big screen adaptation of an ABC TV series from the 80s. Was anyone really clamoring for that? Was there any reason to adapt that into a feature film in 2012? It sounds like just another example of Hollywood cashing in on an established franchise, akin to the decision to make a movie based on the board game Battleship. As it turns out 21 Jump Street is barely an adaptation, and it isn\\'t just an excuse to capitalize on an old concept. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the team behind the brilliant and absurd Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, use the fact that nobody is too invested in the source material to their advantage, subverting all expectations for what a movie like this would be. The result is a smart, exciting and often hilarious action-comedy with real stakes and a surprising amount of heart.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as Schmidt and Jenko respectively, two rookie cops who went to high school together, though belonging to different social circles. Jenko was the popular jock while Schmidt was the unpopular nerd. When they realize each has something the other one needs, a friendship sparks and they become partners. After a failed drug bust, they\\'re reassigned to a special division when their police station decides to \"revive a cancelled program from the 80s\" (get it?). They\\'re sent to a local high school undercover as students to investigate and bring down a drug ring. Despite identical titles, I don\\'t know if we can even call this an adaptation of the show. While the TV show was primarily a drama, the film is essentially a satire of movies and shows like 21 Jump Street, fully aware of all of the clichés of its genre. Writer Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) seems to have realized nobody really cared about a 21 Jump Street movie and instead decided to make something totally different. Early on, in a scene of dialogue that may as well have been delivered directly into the camera, a character explains that there aren\\'t any original ideas these days and so we\\'re stuck rehashing old concepts from the 80s to make a quick buck. In this way and many others, the movie is all about subverting your expectations, which based on this premise are probably very low. It\\'s anything but a lazy cash grab, taking everything you know about buddy cop films and turning it on its head. It embraces the stupidity of its concept too, by constantly acknowledging that Hill and Tatum are way too old to be posing as high school kids, or by having Ice Cube play the stereotypical black police captain from every 80s movie ever, and then outright acknowledging that. In a hilarious early scene Schmidt and Jenko\\'s roles are reversed, with the jock forced to pose as the nerd and the nerd posing as the jock. 21 Jump Street thrives on the unexpected.Many were initially unsure how Channing Tatum would perform, as he is an actor who has never headlined in any major comedies before. While Jonah Hill is without a doubt the star, having had tons of experience in films like Superbad and Knocked Up, Tatum does a fine job as well and the two actors have great chemistry together. In movies like this with two main leads, the rapport between them can make or break the film. With 21 Jump Street, it absolutely makes it.That\\'s ultimately why the movie works as well as it does. Any successful comedy needs real stakes. Otherwise, it just feels like a series of Saturday Night Live sketches with no real purpose. A few years ago, Superbad was extremely successful not just for being a goofy and raunchy comedy, but also for having a believable high school friendship at its core. Similarly, 21 Jump Street works because the friendship between its protagonists feels real, and as a result there are real emotional stakes to go along with the satire. Driving this silly, raunchy comedy is a truly interesting story about popularity and friendship in high school, and about how you might act differently if you could go back as an adult. It\\'s easily the funniest comedy in well over a year, but it\\'s not just a vehicle for jokes: 21 Jump Street tells a great story, too.Phil Lord and Chris Miller seem to love surprising us. As with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street is a movie nobody expected to be great. Its brilliance lies in the fact that it knows all of your complaints ahead of time. Think it sounds like a cheap cash crab based on an 80s property? They make a joke about that. Think Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are too old to play high school kids? They make a joke about that too. It\\'s extremely clever and always two steps ahead of the audience. But what really stands out about 21 Jump Street is that it\\'s not just an enjoyable and hilarious time at the theater, it also tells a genuinely interesting and emotionally compelling story, developing its characters in a way you probably wouldn\\'t anticipate from a raunchy high school comedy.',\n",
       " \"The TV series of 21 Jump Street is always remembered as one of Johnny Depp's early performances. The concept is a bit interesting. At first glance, this movie looks like it's just another mediocre raucous comedy, but it turns out to be a clever one. It's quite a surprise. It stays loyal to its roots except it added some raunchiness and slapstick humor to the story. It's a new kind of 21 Jump Street that is much more fun.I'm not saying it's better than the TV series though. Both are pretty interesting but this one is definitely aiming as a comedy. The film is just crazy stuff with crazy characters living in an absurd setting. The original premise remains but with some buddy comedy elements, and raunchy and slapstick humor. Surprisingly, it works better to the plot. The humor is clever and quite hilarious. These jokes are greatly executed by the stars. Jonah Hill is always a brilliant comedian. Channing Tatum finally plays a none bland character. His chemistry with Hill shines to the film. While the others, Ice Cube hams it up a little but he can provide some laughs. Rob Riggle is just being Rob Riggle. Dave Franco's role here kind of reminds me of his role in Fright Night but he's pretty good with it.The direction is snappy and stylish. The action is fun but I don't think anybody cares about that. The main point of this film is High School and the relationship between Schmidt and Jenko. It shows how the new high school turned their lives upside down. They can't stop playing with their antics on their mission. There is a drama between them. Most of it played as a joke but the heart is always there.All turns out to be pretty well in this film even with all the changes and the absurdity. It's smart, sweet, hilarious, and fun. The fans of the TV series may still get a surprise while they miss the none mad Captain Jenko and the charms of the show. This film is too crazy and absurd but in a clever way. I haven't enjoyed a comedy like this in a while. 21 Jump Street is undeniably fun and it's probably one of the best comedies of the year.\",\n",
       " 'I too expected this to stink. Another buddy cop movie, starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, based on a lousy 80\\'s television show - doesn\\'t sound all that appealing.Hill\\'s \"The Sitter\", completely mediocre, and it\\'s been quite a while since Superbads success. Channing Tatum showed his comedic timing during his appearance on SNL. I was still hesitant.But, I stand corrected.This is the funniest movie since last years\\' Bridesmaids.The key here is the fantastic script. The story isn\\'t rocket-science, and we knew it wouldn\\'t be, but the comedic timing of the leads is spot-on, and they were given a great script to work with.I found myself laughing multiple times throughout. My spouse concurred. One late, unnecessary gross-out moment brought it down a notch. The film hadn\\'t used any of those gimmicks and didn\\'t need to in the end. It just seemed a bit out of place and distasteful.The leads did a great job here. Their characters worked exactly how they should in a buddy-cop flick like this. They bounced off each other for an hour and a half, and the result will surely be one of the best comedies of the year, and an outside shot for my 2012 top-25(back-end)if it can hold-on.Watch out for a sneaky cameo(spoiled by the cast list if you look).Nice surprise.Deserves it\\'s ranking here.Stuck between 7-8, but going with 76/100, so I\\'m rounding to 8.You\\'ll enjoy this if you liked:The Other Guys, Starsky and Hutch, If Looks Could Kill, or Blue Streak - even though I think this is actually a clear notch above all of those films.',\n",
       " \"'21 Jump Street' is a largely forgotten late 80s/early 90s television show, which today is widely acknowledged for helping launch the career of actor Johnny Depp, who you made of heard of. Having not seen a single episode of the program (which was before my time), could I make it through this film with a complete understanding without any backstory? Let me get one thing straight: unlike the show (which deals with such heavy issues as child abuse, homophobia, AIDS, and hat crimes), this is a raunchy comedy. And the movie's not afraid to admit it, as the first ten minutes alone provide us with a galore of genitalia and gross out gags. Normally, these would scare me away and become a liability when considering how one movie would score. Maybe it's the fact that the funniest moments stem from witty banter or creative sequences rather than gross out themselves, but it the raunchiness didn't seem to bother me (for the most part.) Then there's Channing Tatum. If you were to bring his name up anytime before this year, I would shutter.I mean, we all know he might not have the greatest resume ('Fighting' anyone?), but he's honestly one of the best things about this movie. So much so that he even manages to be better than Jonah Hill, one of the best comedic actors working today. Rob Riggle and Ice Cube each provide inspired supporting roles that are nearly laugh out loud funny each time they're on screen, never feeling forced or overused.Does the film have problems? Well...yeah. I won't deny that. Some of the jokes fall flat, while some jokes that initially worked are stretched a little too far. There's the (inevitably) love story between one of the main characters and a high school girl feels too forced and only is there to serve as a 'love story.' But, for the most part, I completely enjoyed it, though I can't ever see myself taking time to watch it again.So if turning a serious-themed show like '21 Jump Street' into a very good raunchy comedy does make me wonder if other old 80s TV shows would make a similar transition. Wouldn't Alf as a pot-smoking, potty-mouthed slacker who still lives with his mom in modern day Los Angeles be an instant classic?\",\n",
       " \"21 Jump Street is a brilliant movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It is filled with pure and sincere laughs from start to finish, certainly one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time, mostly made brilliant with the terrific chemistry between leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, you could tell that they got along very well on the set and enjoyed working together. The movie was also quite heartwarming at times and the characters developed surprisingly well, those are two significant things that make a movie great, as we symphatize with the characters more, but comedies like this usually don't bother with it, I was very impressed that this movie did. Absoluteky hilarious and very enjoyable, I would highly recommend 21 Jump Street to anyone looking for a good comedy New police officers Schmidt and Jenko are sent on an investigation to a high school to find and catch a group of people involved in a drug ring occurring in the school.Best Performance: Jonah Hill Worst Performance: Jake Johnson\",\n",
       " 'This movie was absolutely woeful. I watched it because everyone has be raving about how good it is. To be honest I really shouldn\\'t of expected much given the fact that the general public is impressed by such simple tripe these days.I got two or three laughs out of the entire movie, and these where for that crazy gym teacher who only had a smaller minor role. I didn\\'t think either main character were that good or funny. Didn\\'t like the start of the movie, just seemed to rush right into the main plot with little thought given to the beginning.Lots and lots of gay oral references in this movie. Also lots of stereotypes. I found it a bit weird that the only time you see Tatum being \"aggressive\" is when he is talking to and then later subjugating in a vulgar sexual manner an African American male while in police uniform. He is also seen later to punch in the face another African American male who turns out to be gay.Overall a crap waste of time thats filled with racial and sexual content.',\n",
       " 'The movie version of \"21 Jump Street\" was supposed to be a comedy, I guess. And I guess you would think it\\'s funny if you love the same old jokes about penises over and over from beginning of the movie to the very end, literally.I thought the movie was going to show how two older, wiser guys go back to high school as undercover cops, and show those young kids what\\'s up. THAT would have been interesting. Instead, they go right back to how they were as kids, bumbling and fumbling their way along, and doing a LOT of stupid things as well.The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don\\'t act like two adults pretending to be kids, they act more like two kids pretending to be cops.The original 21 Jump Street with Johnny Depp was a good show. The movie version with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill was just dumb, sorry.This is easily Tatum\\'s worst film, and I can\\'t stand Jonah Hill. Hill is not funny, just annoying, and it makes sense that he co-wrote the script.You can tell Hill has no idea what a cool person is actually like, so he throws in about a hundred penis jokes, along with the usual drug and sexual comments, which take no imagination or creativity at all.

       " 'Back in 1986, sequels had become very common (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones), yet people were suspicious when they heard of a follow-up to Alien, Ridley Scott\\'s acclaimed sci-fi horror from 1979. Most of the criticism was aimed at the fact that Scott had nothing to do with the new movie, which had been entrusted to an unknown (at the time) named James Cameron. Fortunately, Cameron had shown he knew the genre two years earlier with The Terminator, and by perfecting the skills he had developed on that film he delivered Aliens, which still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction flicks of all time.Given how the first film ended (all characters but one died), Cameron wisely decided to radically separate his movie from the original, and he does so from the very beginning by having Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) wake up from her cryogenic sleep and make a shocking discovery: although she hasn\\'t aged at all, 57 years have passed since she left the Nostromo, meaning everyone she knew is either dead or very old (in a particularly heartbreaking scene, she talks on the phone with her grown-up daughter, who is full of resentment for her \"unjustified\" absence). In addition, no one believes her story regarding the alien since, as she\\'s told by scientist Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), the planet where these creatures allegedly lived has been successfully colonized. Suddenly, though, all communications with LV-426 are inexplicably interrupted. Thinking there might be some truth to Ripley\\'s tale, Burke asks her to join him and a group of soldiers on a mission to uncover the mystery. And while most of the participants are in it just for the money, our heroine realizes this is her only chance of confronting her worst nightmare and overcoming it for good.The main problem with Alien, some have said, was that, as great as it can be, the characterizations were reduced to the minimum (not that it really mattered, with Ridley Scott ensuring the film retained the right pace and suspense throughout). With Aliens, character development is the last thing fans should worry about, Cameron being fully aware of each individual\\'s potential and exploiting it as much as he can. Ripley, who was just part of an ensemble in the original, is now allowed to carry the whole film, and boy, does she carry it: rarely has there been a more solid, compelling female role in a genre movie like this (the fact that Sigourney Weaver is the only actress, thus far, to have received an Oscar nomination for a science-fiction film is further testament to Aliens\\' immortality). The supporting cast is equally good, with a multitude of different characters ranging from funny (regular Cameron collaborators Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton) to weird (Lance Henriksen\\'s android Bishop) and bringing something extra to the movie\\'s unique atmosphere.Ah, the film\\'s mood: that\\'s the other aspect Cameron deserves all the credit in the world for. On a superficial level, it could be said Alien was a horror movie, while the follow-up is more action-oriented; that may be true, but one should also notice that every single spectacular battle scene actually oozes tension, never leaving the audience with a pause to breathe or relax. In fact, Cameron has succeeded where many other directors would have failed: he stayed faithful to the original\\'s tone, but managed nonetheless to make the film undeniably his own.Relentlessly creepy, occasionally very violent and consistently compelling, Aliens is a pitch-perfect piece of adult science-fiction. Watch it on a double bill with Scott\\'s version and you will get four hours of genre film-making at its finest.',\n",
       " \"So often when you think of sequels you imagine cynical attempts to cash in on successful movies, efforts to bring in the coins with any old rubbish, when you think of the likes of Police Academy, Halloween and Jaws you can understand why, and then there is Aliens......Not often is a follow up as good as the original (and better in some ways,) but Aliens is, I would class it as one of the best movies of all time, a cinematic Masterpiece which seems to improve with age. It's a space horror, which is dramatic, action packed and funny at times.Aliens changed the genre, sci fi would never quite be the same again. This film will have you gripped, glued and on the edge of your seat, truly an adrenaline fuelled thrill ride, with amazing visuals, wonderful acting, and terrific music. Film makers of today watch and see how it should be done.A masterpiece. 10/10\",\n",
       " \"This movie is my ultimate guilty pleasure. It's inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)Despite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I can watch it 'til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his Bruce Willis 'thing' (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must save the world- who would have thunk it?I think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office (no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a 'high concept' like this (so high it's basically a parody by itself.) And only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He's far more suited to these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)I read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I do think if you're going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well go all the way. It's better than having something that is a confused mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no 'it could really happen!' here.So after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie.\",\n",

There were a great deal of laughs too (mostly intentional) anyone who hasn't seen this but just wants relax and enjoy a good (yet Shallow) action flick then this certainly fits the bill.For pure entertainment value i score it 8/10If this is for you then check out The Core and Independence Day, avoid the Day after Tomorrow and Deep Impact, there not really for action fans.\",\n",

It's not supposed to sweep the Oscars, the acting isn't supposed to be perfect, and it's not supposed to make perfect sense.The story follows a group of oil drillers sent by NASA to stop an asteroid that will strike the world in eighteen days.  The drillers are taught and trained to become astronauts (in a very comedic scene) and then sent to the asteroid to drop the nukes and blow it up.  After that, a whole lot goes wrong.I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone's been calling it 'mindless action'.  It's not mindless, it's actually very dramatic.  The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Ben Affleck does a good job.Bruce Willis captures the 'reluctant hero' role, and Liv Tyler does well as his daughter.

But from the opening scenes, 'ARMAGEDDON' explodes into emergency action. This sci-fi comedy-drama was a solid hit!! I have to fully disagree with critics who will praise a horrible movie and then say that a story like this is not bigger than life. This is a blockbuster entertainment giant, with a striking sense of humor, which 'Rockhound' (Bucsemi) provided many laughs, along with the rest of the multi-talented and troubled 'troup' of civilized maniacs. I truly think that the plot of the story is fun to think about, the world needs to be saved by a bunch of motley-ruff necks that can hardly obey the regular laws in their own city and now, they are going to work with the laws of gravity, science and all else to keep the planet from becoming a memory. Every movie mogul wants a block buster that is going to in essence save the world from total oblation and hit the box office with a vengeance. This one does it with he-man style and a wise-crack or two. They all ride together though, Harry Stamper, Grace the young in love daughter of Harry, Charles Chapple er, I mean 'Chick', A.J. also in love with Grace much to Harry's uneasiness, 'Rockhound' who just wants to have girls' who 'just want to have fun' the man who is a sky-scraper if anything else, Jayotis 'Bear' who is strong and a bit on the sensitive side, just to give us equilibrium, when they landed on the surface of the huge rock and he looks up and emotional and exclaims Thank you Jesus! The theater roared! He was right though. Then there is 'Oscar' who is a fun having not so fearless worker, and the comically sarcastic, but easy going Max, all under N.A.S.A Administrator Dan Truman who can't fly anymore. But he gets to watch these birds-of-a-feather, working together. With everyone up and going plus Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut who works hard and gets a little too rowdy! They are able even with the adversity of Col. William Sharp they come together and pull it off and even with the last few moments when Harry Gives his life for A.J. in a very touching moment the story comes together and sets it right, the screw balls have a mature moment and a sobering lesson. But this crew is great!! They all mix together like a great drink. Bruce has the Juice, along with the rest of the motley crew, making this adventure a blast, even by today's standards it still comes across with strength, style, and comedic punch!

And talk about loud.....holy eardrums, Bataman, you could be deaf listening to this movie which includes a lot of loud heavy-metal \"music.\" It\\'s too noisy.There are touches of \"Independence Day\" mentality with very unrealistic with a veteran astronaut smuggling a gun on board a ship; the daughter of the one of the astronauts barging into the command center and shoving the center\\'s leader in the middle of a crisis (in reality, she wouldn\\'t be allowed in the room to begin with); and the usual last-second impossible heroics. I mean, sometimes I swear I was watching a movie made specifically for morons. Speaking of stupid, what was that goofy cosmonaut character (Peter Stormare) all about. That\\'s just another example of what I was just talking about - totally unrealistic people. Why does Hollywood like to portray astronauts - some of the classiest, most educated and reserved people in the world - in such a negative light? Just another of its sicknesses, I guess where good is bad and bad is good.THE GOOD - What was great to watch in this film were the special-effects, especially the disaster scenes with the meteors hitting the earth. They were spectacular. A few of the panoramic scenes in here were beautiful, too. (This is a must for widescreen DVD.)There is a good mix of humor in this adventure thriller. That humor makes some of the characters likable, even though they are still unrealistically sleazy heroes. Steve Buscemi had most of the good comedic lines. I liked Billy Bob Thornton as the NASA boss. He\\'s very interesting to watch. Bruce Willis plays his normal macho-hero role. His heroic effort in the end is nicely sentimental. The special-effects, as mentioned earlier, were perhaps the best right in the first 5-10 minutes of the film - a real attention-grabber right off the bat. Actually, the first half of this film is far better than the second half.',\n",
       " \"Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since 'Return of the Jedi'. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it's own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it's definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.The idea of another prequel movie was a hard sell; but unlike the prequel (and for that matter, the sequel) trilogy, this manages to tell it's own story within the structure of a lead-up to an event to which we already know the outcome. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are especially effective along with secondary characters like those played by Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen becoming easy fan favorites. Ben Mendelsohn is great as always as Krennic despite not being given much dimension as a main villain.The character of Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker) seems a little cut-up and while I understand the character is better informed by one of the animated series, what we have in the film seems like it may have been a little more beefed up in earlier edits of the movie.One thing I hear from people who don't care for this movie is the amount of fan-service moments. Random appearances of old characters or species, call-backs to famous lines and some easter-egg visuals can be a little distracting and if you don't care for that self-indulgent stuff, you'll definitely notice it here. Personally, it never really bothered me apart from one instance that lasts 5 seconds.On a final note, while the decision to include Darth Vader was inevitable for this movie, I was so glad to see they did a little more than give him a short cameo appearance and actually give him a moment or two without leaning on him too much as a crutch to distract the audience.If you love old Star Wars and couldn't care less about the two superfluous trilogies that followed, consider giving this a try.\",\n",
       " \"I've just returned from the midnight showing of Rogue One here in the UK. I was slightly sceptical after watching Force Awakens, while enjoyed FA it did lack teeth and flesh.Rogue one was a great prequel to New Hope.We know that Princess Leigh had the death star plans but how did she get them ??.Well now we know.A few minutes into the film I felt disappointed that there was no Star Wars theme or rolling credits. Once I got past this the film started coming to life and put you right into the star wars universe. There were nudges to the originals everywhere, old characters from New Hope were brought to live to return to the big screen.There was plenty of visual eye candy here and a climactic ending that was truly stunning. I want to watch it again to see all the little details.This is a dark and emotional film compared to others but it has its light hearted moments also.Without giving too much away we follow a rag tag bunch fighting against the Empire and Lord Vader. A lost girl, a rebel agent, a defector, a novice trainee of the force, a hot shot gunner and a reprogrammed imperial robot. Alongside the rebel alliance they discover the existence of the Empires latest super weapon and must a find a way to destroy it. The Bad - 1.Some of the dialogue is wooden but this goes for all Star Wars film. 2. There is a lull in action about midway through and the dark scenes at this point may bore some people.3. No JediThe Good - 1. Amazing climactic ending a real visual treat.2. Ties in really well to New Hope.3. Interesting characters not your typical heroes which makes them more interesting.4. I got emotional at the end xIf your a fan of the originals then don't miss this film. My Star Wars marathon just got better ( and bigger )8/10 xx\",\n",
       " \"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.\",\n",
       " 'I thoroughly enjoyed \"Spider-Man,\" which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing.  Director Sam Raimi kept the action quotient high, but also emphasized the human element of the story.  Tobey Maguire was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then, after his run-in with the radioactive, genetically engineered spider, as the athletic, acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs.  I also didn\\'t mind the changes to the \"Peter Parker: The Amazing Spider-Man\" comic book story that the film\\'s writers made, e.g., having Spider-Man\\'s web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of Peter Parker\\'s.  Especially good were Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Parker, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  And in a small but memorable role, J.K. Simmons (\"Oz,\" Law & Order\") as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious.  Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good.  Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computer-generated image (or a stunt double for that matter), it didn\\'t detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I saw the movie with a six-year-old, who found the villainous Green Goblin -- superbly personified by Willem Dafoe -- very, very frightening, so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" comic book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I can honestly say that Sam Raimi has done it justice!  I\\'m going to go see this movie again (sans terrified six-year-old).',\n",
       " 'Having seen the trailers for this film I have to say that I didn\\'t walk into the cinema with high hopes. The computer effects looked badly integrated, the Green Goblin\\'s costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).As it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I\\'ve yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you\\'ll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think \"Hey, that\\'s an actor, not Peter Parker\". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don\\'t have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like \"friendly neighbourhood spider-man\" are fully in-keeping with the character.\\nThe comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin\\'s costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.All-in-all a great film that I wouldn\\'t hesitate for a second in recommending.',\n",
       " \"Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. \\nAfter having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.\",\n",
       " \"Normally I can't stand movies derived from comics, for example the duds that were the Hulk & Daredevil, but this one surprised me.An excellent take on the comic book character created by Stan Lee. Next to the X-Men movies that came out about the same time, and Superman with Christopher Reeve, it is definitely one of the better Comic to Movie films put out.The cast is well chosen. McGuire is Spiderman/Peter Parker to me. I don't think they could have chosen better. Kirsten Dunst makes a decent Mary Jane Watson, wasn't ever fond of her to begin with, but it's pulled off well. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin is sheer genius. The story is well written and keeps you along for the entire ride, coupled with action that's explosive and thrilling.

Happily I was not disappointing as the show now has my full attention and I really liked it, looks like another HBO. So you know the premise, killer gets dragged into an acting class, finds out he loves it even though he sucks, now he wants to balance killing with his new found passion. But without giving anything away, there is more to the story than just that. The writing was as witty and charismatic as I expected, kind of reminded me of Dexter. The producers are known for some pretty big shows like Seinfeld, Silicon Valley, and of course Bill Hader himself. So its no surprise we have another fun little show on our hands.Bill Hader's performance is just as unexpectedly good as everything else in this show, his character is very intriguing, unique, and fun to watch. Same goes for all the other actors like Stephen Root and Sarah Goldberg, such a great chemistry everyone has makes for a good show so far.

       " 'The book and story upon which this Hollywood flock is based is awesome, and even important. The movie is a fairly standard Hollywood-version military exercise, and I can\\'t fully fault the production team or actors because they have to tell a big story in 2 hours about a major event that should be well known to Americans and Afghans alike, let alone the rest of the world. Plus, no one behind the special effects or acting or script or direction were there. Much like Lone Survivor it\\'s a pretty decent depiction of a true story for a film production, but also much like Lone Survivor, I wish it had taken the source material a tad more seriously, and attached much more telling and brutal realism (like Saving Private Ryan and The Hurt Locker) in terms of mood and dialog and acting, and even equipment and battle scenes. I don\\'t want a Tears Of The Sun fairy tale with my war movies. I want something that transports us there. More realistic tactics, weapons that fire and report realistically, bombs that aren\\'t full of fireballs all the time, etc... All could have been done here. But many would have lost interest in the drama... It\\'s been dumbed down, and 90% of the audience will have no idea. Maybe I demand too much, or am too picky, or just don\\'t accept the \"average\" like \"average\" Americans who don\\'t look any deeper at stuff like war other than action films and headlines. I feel like our veterans deserve better. Meanwhile, the negative reviews here are by folks who really have no idea what they\\'re talking about, especially when they call it \"propaganda\". Politics produce propaganda. This is a story based on actual accounts...as in: it happened. Doesn\\'t matter what your politics are. Read the book Horse Soldiers. Talk to more vets. Talk to some Afghani people who know a bit about their own country and the Taliban. This movie could have been WAY better, but it was sinply \"good\" as what we\\'ve come to expect from Hollywood most of the time. I think it was wasted on misguided and detached production values and sensationalism that can only be provided by limited knowledge and devotion. Had Spielberg made this flick? Might have been an all-time great. And I say MIGHT, because it would be almost impossible to bring the reality and education to the screen that the book was able to portray and provide, and the reality on the ground these men experienced. Why we settle for pop culture education on important matters and historical events as our ONLY education is beyond me. But it seems the American audience wouldn\\'t know the difference if REALITY ran over them in the form of a stampede of horses with a team of US special forces and Afghan militia on their backs. So I guess there\\'s no real hard done, right?',\n",
       " \"This show is ridiculously unrealistic, but tbh I don't even care. It's obvious that it's not supposed to be the most serious show ever, so I'm totally fine with it being completely over the top.The main actors are very easy on they eyes, and are doing a pretty decent job with their acting (nothing outstanding of course).The actors are way too old for the roles they are playing, until Sarah said she was only 16, I wasn't really sure what age they were supposed to be. But whatever, that's nothing new. Casting of age approproate actors is super hard, so I can't deduct any points for that really.I am not completely finished yet, but so far it's fun, fast paces, enjoyable.Edit: After finishing the show I CAN'T WAIT for season 2. It got SO much better with each episode, and honestly, at the end this felt like a really high quality production, and it's a really good setup for a potential second season.\\nWhat impressed me the most is how well the dialogie was written, it was really believable.

You see the premise and the promise, and are left to wonder what a better written plot could have done to this.

These characters were great in this show and worked well together. The first 7 episodes of the season are all about looking for a lost treasure and it is amazing. Like I really loved the first 7 episodes. The last three episodes takes a whole new direction and it is so frustrating. The police start acting like TV cops and they don't even do any investigating. They shut down the whole island and have a man hunt of one mans word. These last 3 episodes are hard to watch and hurt this season so much. Also, does no one on this island have cell phones? Even if they didn't they would have some sort of device they could use over wifi. But this show likes to assume the audience is stupid so they do not explain any of this.

But I have to say: Pope's character was the worst, and I am not sure if it is due to lackluster acting or bad writing. He was boring atleast.\\nYoung teenagers played by 20-something adults is common in most shows and you have them in this show too. John B is played by a 27 year old man which bothers me. But elsewise the performances are nice enough I guess.Outer Banks is entertaining, but it just lacks a certain flavour. It could have been so much better. But it is what it is. And it is watchable if you just ignore it's obvious flaws. For me this show falls under a category of shows I watch once and forget about, until a new season is out. Which I probably won't watch.I recommend watching Outer Banks if you don't have anything else to watch, or if you like Riverdale, The Society or On My Block.\",\n",
       " 'When the Vietnam War ends, Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his partner Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) from the Monarch organization succeed to get the financing for an expedition to the recently discovered Skull Island from Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins). He hires the former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson); and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.\"Kong: Skull Island\" is a brainless adventure with several stupidities. For example, the number of helicopters in the beginning of the journey of Randa, Conrad and Packard is totally incompatible with the size of their ship. Bo pilot would dare to cross a storm like that in a helicopter. The attack of all the helicopters to Kong is absolutely imbecile. Most of the survivor\\'s attitude are at least unreasonable. On the other side, the adventure is highly entertaining and the special effects are top notch. Therefore the best option to the viewer is to shut down the brain and enjoy the adventure since this is the purpose of this type of blockbuster.

Tom Hiddleston plays a tracker, Brie Larson plays a photographer, and John C.

Kong: Skull Island pays homage to Apocalypse Now quite frequently even though it seems a bit excessive at times.Kong looked good, almost all the creatures looked cool and all the fights between them looked really good, especially in IMAX 3D.

It is stereotypes upon stereotypes. It is a major waste of talent with Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L Jackson and Academy Award winner Brie Larson (\"Room\") struggling in the muddled chaos. You could see and feel the disappointment. Even Kong seems confused. The performances are half- hearted and there is just no substance for them to work with. I bet all they were thinking of while filming was \\'get me out of here\\' – literally. For the majority of the film, everyone says very few words to each other. The conversations are forced and laughable. It wouldn\\'t have made a difference if they were just silent. It\\'s so predictable that you would know exactly what the next line would be. I thought while watching this, was this meant to be an exaggerated satire of King Kong? Or was it meant to be taken seriously? Even the execution of the film presents the same questions. At one point, it would be slow and mystic, and minutes later, overly upbeat music would hit your ears, and we are treated to magnified slow-motion action. It feels it is trying too hard to get our attention. And once it does, it doesn\\'t know how to sustain it. And finally, there are so many extreme close-ups of Samuel L. Jackson\\'s face, it probably took up half the film. They did it to match Kong\\'s face, so you can imagine how gigantic it was. Maybe if Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts figured out from the beginning what type and style of film this would be, it would have been a better film. It seems like he had an idea but is unconvicted towards it, and instead keeps changing his mind to offer more \\'fun\\'. The result that it is a jumble of various pieces that don\\'t belong in the same puzzle.',\n",

One more X-Men and the world shall vomit unto itself. I have the remedy for what ails Hollywood though: Go to Unoriginality Anonymous meetings and force yourself to try to write an original script People should boycott all these nefarious cash-ins Ban JJ Abrams from anywhere near Los Angeles (and his ilk) No more Morgan Freeman either Give Samuel Jackson an integrity infusion etcAs for this film: A group of cash whore actors gather in a film studio to parody the original dignified metaphor that was King Kong. The actors make jokes that are hilariously funny. Then they run away and ambush and attack Jurassic style. Then they go somewhere and there are a lot of explosions. The enemies are ugly, and they also fight each other, so it's OK to kill them. After two hours the film ends. The film is marketed to kiddies, kiddies-in-brain and China (via the token Chinese eye candy or in this case plain vanilla useless whatever..)Did you hear? Kong called his agent in New York City, USA at the Empire State Building to ask his images be erased from this turkey and demand that his agent get him better work going forward. The agent wouldn't take his call however. How could he? He didn't recognize the caller. That isn't King Kong after all.\",\n",

Well, in a way, that\\'s this version of KONG, and I am really happy and surprised at just how GOOD it was.Take a bit of the original Kong, mix it with one part Private Ryan, a dash of The Deer Hunter, some Monty Python, lots of Jurassic Park, a pinch of A Space Oddity and mix well with some (insert your favorite lower-key funny movies HERE). The result is a pleasing fare one can really sink their teeth into and enjoy.It has some familiar faces too, and what\\'s best about it, is that not only do they live up to their so-called stardom, but even the unfamiliar or not-yet- \"famous\" actors with smaller roles, really do a great job and sell it. At no time while you are watching this movie do you feel it far-fetched or unbelievable that Kong actually exists, and isn\\'t that, in a nutshell, what all movies should aspire to - the suspension of disbelief?

I think I just might use his appearance in future films as cause to not see them because he is clearly cast for his popularity and for a quick marketing boost for films that clearly need that extra kick.

This is an all out creature feature...It is called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with all the neat creatures.There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. And LOTS of cool death scenes. Pretty gory, in my opinion, and surprised this got a pg-13. Some scenes would be very frightening for little ones.Most surprisingly, it is the the acting of John Goodman and J.C. Riley that stands out - even overshadowing tom Hiddleston. I am not a big fan of Goodman or Riley, so this really surprised me.For the plot - people go to Skull Island. They encounter Kong and various giant monsters. Mayhem and death ensues. Some return home. The end.Doesn't sound like much but the monster scenes really made the movie, and Kong was fantastic. They really had him move - he was almost like a giant Hulk smashing those airplanes!Oh, and PLEASE stay after the credits. What was shown put a BIG smile on my face...

       " 'The legendary King Kong returns in an all new adventure that gives the classic tale a much needed update and new setting. Unlike Perter Jackson\\'s retelling of the original Black and White film, \"Kong: Skull Island\" eschews the old for the new and in doing so breathes a much needed new life and vitality into the franchise.The film is set in 1973 when William Randa (John Goodman), informs the government that they have detected a previously unknown island and need to investigate it before the Soviets learn of it and beat them to whatever the island my hold.William recruits a team which includes a former British officer named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), and Photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), to assist his team lead by Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), in mapping the island.William also asks for a military escort and the government enlists Lt. Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), and his team to accompany the mission. Packard is trying to find his place in the world as he and his helicopter combat team are dealing with the recent end of the Vietnam War. His men are looking forward to going home and resuming their lives, but a dour Packard jumps at the chance for another mission over the uncertainty of the future.Upon arriving on the mysterious island and starting their survey mission by using seismic charges, the team attract the attention of Kong who is not at all pleased with the intrusion on his island. Kong makes short work of the copters and the team finds themselves scattered about the dangerous island. They soon learn that Kong is not the only danger on the island and must find a way to rejoin each other and make it to their extraction point alive.Naturally some of the characters have a hidden agenda and there are dangerous and action around every corner. Further complicating matters is the appearance of Marlow (John C. Reilly), a downed WWII pilot who has been stranded on the island for 23 years and warns of dangers far greater than Kong that are ahead of the team.The film combines a solid cast with state of the art special effects to take a new twist on the standard adventure fare. While many parts of the film remain silly Popcorn entertainment, the quality of the assembled cast allows the film to move beyond being just an assembly of potential victims for a menagerie of CGI creatures to dispatch. While the story is more in lines with the linear and thin plots of adventure films of old, the sum of the parts does add up to an enjoyable film experience for those who like the giant creature films. You will want to make sure to stay after the credits as there is a very good scene that shows a setup for a future film that had those in attendance at our press screening cheering.The film may be a bit intense for younger viewers but if you are looking for a touch of nostalgia and action, you may find the film just what you need.3.5 stars out of 5.',\n",
       " \"King Kong (1933) was a perfect movie in its proposal. A simple, direct and clear message. No remakes or sequels required. This is why all sequels and remakes are always inferior in impact to the original. Filmmakers always want to add anything new and unnecessary. In this new film, Kong leaves the territory of quality and embarks on a trip to the territory of blockbusters, in other words, special effects and jokes (just watch the retarded and unnecessary joke scene about the Skullcrawlers name with Hiddleston, Larson and John C. Reilly) overlap the story, and so the film is passable and totally forgettable in a week.Once again, Hollywood treats scientists as idiots when the character of Corey Hawkins can not even open a can of canned food and feels intimidated by a woman. Not to mention the macho colonel, who wants an unnecessary revenge with Kong, because Kong killed his men (in a casual meeting).And not to mention the idiotic plans that Jordan Vogt-Roberts uses to focus the eyes of the Samuel L. Jackson character with the eyes of King Kong. It seems like the director Jordan Vogt-Roberts wants to make a kind of (unnecessary) fight in the old west style. Pure waste of time, as we know that the macho colonel, is no challenge for Kong, so why waste precious screen time with these situations? Because Kong's story can be told as in the original in just 90 or 100 minutes. And the filmmarkers have to put 2 hours of film and for this they have to put unnecessary situations and scenes. As the disposable soldier of the colonel, who gets lost from the group, just to see Kong crush a giant squid (and then Kong eats it), then after some scenes, be killed by another giant monster. What could be an interesting conflict between the characters of Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson, but that ends up in nothing. Because people are written from a stupid one-dimensional way (like the stupid macho colonel). That is, more movie time, for less story. This is because Kong never leaves the island in this movie, Kong will only leave the island in 2020 in the movie Godzilla vs. King Kong. Yes this movie aims to create another shared universe (MCU type of crap), and in the end this compromises the quality of this film. The filmmakers have their hands tied, because they can not put their best on this film, however they have to think how this movie will work with another movie from another guy, three long years into the future.I went into the movie hoping to see a good and fun Kong movie, and I ended up seeing a crap and bad one, because of the ambition of the studio that compromised the quality of the movie, for the money. Not to mention, even as a fun movie, this movie fails so much. You see, the scenes with special effects, you can see that the scenes were all filmed on a green screen. And the final fight between Kong and the giant lizard is even inferior to the T-rex fights in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake. Yes, the fights and clashes between Kong and the other giants monsters were better, bigger, more epic, more brutal and vicarious than in this pathetic 2017 movie. I'm not defending the Peter Jackson movie, that film obviously had its flaws, but in the department of special effects and action scenes (this department that does not save a movie, nonetheless) is vastly superior to this Jordan Vogt- Roberts movie. Even as an action movie and blockbuster, this movie fails in a big way.But if you were disappointed, and if you were sad that you had lost money unfairly, you can wait until 2020 to see the rest of the film in Godzilla VS King Kong.My God, that's why commercial filmmaking is in the mud. The commercial cinema has as main target children, teenagers and young people. And this is why the quality bar is so low.\",\n",
       " \"After the crushing disappointment that was Godzilla, I have to say that Kong: Skull Island is a tremendous surprise. Not only a hugely entertaining monster movie, but a well-directed, well-written and well-acted film full of ideas from start to finish. Its action set- pieces are utterly spectacular, the CGI is fantastic, and there's even a story that's genuinely interesting throughout, something that I definitely didn't expect going in.But by far the greatest achievement of this film is the presence of Kong himself. As plain as most of the film was, the biggest issue with Godzilla was that there just wasn't enough Godzilla. Fortunately, Skull Island rectifies that exact problem, and makes Kong as big a character in the film as any of the humans, appearing on screen at regular intervals, and actually playing a genuine role in the story.And that story is probably the thing that surprised me most of all. Again, Godzilla was a slow, empty and formulaic monster movie that really bored me. Kong: Skull Island, on the other hand, is a fast- paced and absolutely jam-packed action movie that actually gets better and better as it moves along.Of course, there's a part of me that's a little sad that we're not getting the classic story of King Kong that made both the 1933 and 2005 films so beautiful. However, Skull Island does do a fantastic job at bringing the character to a different time period and making a new, riveting story.Above all, the film's ingenious parallels with the Vietnam War make for fascinating viewing. Bringing a different dynamic to the relationship between the humans and Kong, the way that Skull Island looks at the story through the lens of the anti-Vietnam War sentiment of the 1970s adds an impressive layer of depth to the story, keeping Kong an interesting and emotionally resonant character despite removing his love with Ann Darrow.What's more is that some of the film's characters have some very layered and interesting backstories. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson's character, a stubborn, war-mongering colonel taken from the Vietnam War he loved fighting in, is hugely interesting to watch. At times mimicking the role of film director Carl Denham from the original, at others adding a far darker and more serious edge to the story of the invasion of Skull Island, he's absolutely fascinating to follow from start to finish.There are a whole host of other characters that bring some impressive depth to the story, depth that I certainly didn't expect after the two-dimensional heroes of Godzilla, and make the film's large ensemble cast work amazingly well.One more positive from the film is undoubtedly the action. As I said, this is a very exciting monster movie that's full of action throughout. Above all, the opening and closing action sequences really stand out. Both because of the amazing visual parallels drawn with Vietnam War films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, but also thanks to the stunning CGI that allows Kong to tower over the screen in comparison to the humans, but also puts a formidable and genuinely terrifying enemy on a very level playing field.As far as blockbusters go, Skull Island is top-quality, but it still isn't entirely perfect. For one, whilst it's brimmed with ideas and interesting characters throughout, that does lead the film to becoming a little crowded at times. The lack of a main character amidst the huge ensemble cast means it's definitely not as streamlined as I would have liked.Also, the parallels with Vietnam, whilst unique and great to see in a movie like this, are a little overbearing at times. Particularly in the first act, there comes a point where the film really hits you over the head with how similar it is to Apocalypse Now, and although that does die down to a better level later on, it's a little frustrating at times.Simply put, Skull Island is an impressively brainy and innovative blockbuster, but it goes a little too far with everything it does. That's far better than a completely empty film like Godzilla, but with an enormous main cast and a story that's so jam-packed, I felt like things could have been carried out a little smoother than the finished product.Still, I had a really good time with Kong: Skull Island. It's a massively entertaining monster movie that places its title character right in the thick of the action, surrounded by more interesting human characters, excellent visuals, stunning action sequences, and a genuinely engrossing and intelligent original story.\",\n",
       " \"This review pains me to write, because I genuinely think that Season 1 was the pinnacle of serialized television. It had amazing plotting, a satisfying ending, a terrifying villain, characters that I loved, nothing superfluous, beautiful cinematography and tone. It delivered on every promise that it made. I could not wait for Season 2. And those two years were tough. Alas it finally arrived. I knew going in that it had a tough act to follow and so I made a concerted effort to judge it on it's own merits and not to dismiss it just for failing to achieve the impossible by living up to the first. What went wrong. Plotting: All over the place with little focus. A terrifying villain? Try NO villain. Characters that I love? Yes but the two leads are mostly kept separate from each other for some strange reason. Nothing superfluous? Carrie Ann Moss and her entire sub-plot was boring and irrelevant. Jessica's rival PI was a flat plot device. A satisfying ending? I wouldn't know, I couldn't get past episode 8. It was putting me to sleep. The season did continue to have beautiful cinematography and tone/atmosphere, but that gets no points from me if the writing is dull. Nutmeg can make good egg nog great, but it's not appetizing when eaten on it's own. I think the biggest problem with Season 2 is that it fails to deliver on Jessica Jones' core promise: it is a sci-fi super-hero show about a tortured loner who does not want to be a superhero but is, none-the-less, forced to fight super-villains because they are threatening her and the people she loves. In other words, Season 2 was Jurassic Park without Dinosaurs. I'm giving the show a 5. A perfect 10 for the first season, and a 0 for the second.\",\n",
       " \"Jessica Jones, the second of the Marvel Netflix shows was absolutely amazing when it's first season came out. However, season 2 of this show takes a step in the wrong direction and is notably worse.Overall, the show is as dark and gritty as Daredevil is, mixed with a bit of dark humor as well. Jessica Jones is a good, noir style superhero show, that kind of fills a niche that wasn't previously filled before. One could argue that the first season actually has horror and thriller elements mixed in with it. This makes the show even better. The villain for season 1, Kilgrave, was absolutely incredible and is the highlight of the show. Played to perfection by David Tennant, you're glued to the screen whenever he's on. Krysten Ritter is also perfect as the sarcastic Jessica Jones. The casting made great choices there, although Marvel always does tend to make good casting decisions anyway. My least favorite part of season 1 being the character of Malcolm. In my opinion, this character is just pointless, and doesn't really add anything to the show.I believe since the first season was so good, it tips the scale in a better direction for the show. However, if season 3 is as bad as season 2, that may change. For right now, Jessica Jones is still the third best of the Marvel Netflix shows, behind Daredevil and Punisher.My Rating: 8.0/10\",\n",
       " \"Imagine if Jessica Jones hadn't recently undergone the entire adventure with The Defenders...or had...but learned absolutely nothing from it. That's what Season 2 consists of: A poorly written character demonstrating no growth as a human being. And that's the first episode.The new season is simply bad. The first episode does nothing to draw you in, and the rest of them simply drive the viewer farther and farther away. There's no real villain, the protagonist has grown even more self-pitying and annoying, and the supporting characters seem to exist simply to draw attention away from how weak the overall narrative is. They could have done this with a 2 hour film and not extended the series as they did.I would advise only fans of the lead actress to watch this program as anyone seeking a superhero Marvel film (especially in the wake of Thor:Ragnarok and The Black Panther) will be hugely disappointed. When you finally get to the end of the series, you ask yourself why you even bothered to take the trip.Not good at all.\",\n",
       " \"If for nothing else, watch Jessica Jones for David Tennant's performance as Kilgrave. He is better than any other Marvel movie or TV villain ever seen before. He is truly terrifying but oddly hypnotizing. He can make you do whatever he tells you to. Not only does David Tennant's charisma make this believable, but the writers use it in a lot of cool ways. As a villain, he's right up there with Heath Ledger's Joker.Krysten Ritter (Jesse's girlfriend from season 2 of Breaking Bad) plays the lead. It's great to see a Female Marvel lead, and she delivers a wonderfully understated performance. The show starts off as a gritty detective show with dry humour and not much of Tennant. However, as the show goes along, it evolves into something much cooler. It gets darker but also funnier, and Tennant's involvement becomes larger.In conclusion, Jessica Jones is a very binge-able show with a memorable villain and a great lead that doesn't need much prior knowledge despite tying into the Marvel universe. In my opinion, it's even better than Daredevil.\",\n",
       " \"If you're considering watching this show, chances are you've already watched Marvel's Daredevil and know what to expect: a darker, grittier tone than the rest of the Marvel universe, great production values and strong characterization. It delivers all those things and more.Jessica Jones tells the story of a retired superhero, a woman who tried to help and failed. Jessica is a broken character; she suffers from PTSD, has nightmares and constant flashbacks and drinks a lot. She's an incredibly compelling protagonist; flawed but strong, broken but fighting, sad but with a sarcastic edge that makes her funny and easy to love.The show isn't afraid to explore dark themes of sexual assault, rape and abortion and it does so with taste. The victims are not shown being raped; the viewer is just expected to believe them without titillating rape scenes to prove the facts.As a survivor herself, Jessica shows both the signs of her trauma and the will to fight back. Women in Jessica Jones suffer, they fail, but they fight.Unlike Daredevil's Kingpin, Killgrave is a threat from the first episode which results is better pacing (Daredevil took 4 episodes to find its feet in my opinion). Because of Jessica's PTSD, you constantly feel his shadow and the tension is constant. The show doesn't waste time with an origin story or training sequences; it takes you straight into the action and doesn't let you go.A definite success for Marvel.\",\n",
       " \"Much like Daredevil, the real saga of Jessica Jones is that of the Villain. David Tennant shines as a dark and broken sociopath. His performance is chilling and terrifying and asks dark questions about what we would do with ultimate power over those around us, and about what would become of us.Stepping past Tennant's breathtaking performance, the rest of the casting is apt and on point. Any fan of the comic books will be hard pressed to fault Jessica Jones or Luke Cage. Their chemistry and dynamic is ink made flesh and the characters that we loved brought to screen. The supporting cast are equally brilliant, especially the trio of Australian actors supporting in the roles of Trish Walker, Will Simpson and Malcolm. Comic book buffs will quickly spot the nods to comic cannon and the fascinating divergence and rebirth of comic book icons. There is extensive dialogue and set references to comic book icons that shows a phenomenal attention to detail that becomes a love letter to long term fans of these properties.Jessica Jones breathes yet more life into the promise of the Defenders franchise at Netflix. Bring on Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and future seasons. If for some reason you haven't yet signed up for Netflix - this show alone is a reason to do so.\",\n",
       " 'Point Break is one of those films that\\'s massively entertaining no matter how many times you watch it. Whilst this is common in the action genre, Point Break stands out in its era by being more of a morally complex story.The villain here is not your usual action villain. Keanu Reeves\\' character forms a complex bond with him and surfing culture to the point where it breaks his heart to have to bring him down. Swayze plays him like a charismatic cult leader and its believable that he\\'d sway enough people to get them onside for bank heists, all in the name of adrenaline. This makes Point Break not a film of \"bad guys vs good guys\" but a real exploration of a subculture and how it gets inside people\\'s heads.It help that this is also a kick ass, brilliantly shot action film, with incredible sequences like the foot chase through LA and the skydiving making it as exciting as it is thoughtful. Unfortunately it came out in the same year as Terminator 2 so was (and is) criminally overlooked.',\n",
       " 'Katheryn Bigelow\\'s 1991 action thriller \"Point Break\" is still a ground-breaking film of the early nineties. It tells the story of the cop John Utah (Keanu Reaves) hunting a bunch of bank robbers camouflaged with masks of the former U.S. presidents. His investigations leads to a group of surfers and extreme sports worshippers, and the cop becomes fascinated by the free-style philosophies and adrenaline rushes of the gang around the charismatic leader Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Their close friendship changes to a hard-fought rivalry at the end when cop and gangsters face point blank.Bigelow uses typically American surf beach settings for this unusual and very stylish action thriller with great stunts like parachuting scenes, bank robberies, a car chase, police raids, martial arts, breath-taking chases and brilliantly photographed surf sequences. Watch out for the Red Hot Chillie Peppers as a gang of brutal surf nazis beating up Keanu Reeves and being captured by him during a hard-fought police raid.But \"Point Break\" is even more than that - it also shows the lifestyle of the nineties in many ways. Bodie and his gang are a group of New Age-like grunge guys reaching out for the most extreme adrenaline experiences. They stand for the new style of extreme/fun sport worshippers, ravers and new spiritualists of the post-yuppie era in the nineties who don\\'t care about wealth and status symbols but for fun, action, breaking the limits and finding the sum of all senses. \"Point Break\" is not only a well-done example of modern action entertainment without computer-generated special effects but also a very philosophical and spiritual study of society in the nineties.',\n",
       " 'You know those movies where there\\'s not one realistic thing about them, but it only adds to the charm and fun of it? Where the insanity and occasional inane script choices make it that much more entertaining? Point Break is such a film. It doesn\\'t operate on any levels of reality, unashamedly, and wears its \"movie\" status proudly, deciding instead to tell a intricate tale, which is loads of fun. Kathryn Bigelow should be proud.Point Break is pure fantasy. It jams surfing, action, love, and crime into one awesome-looking package, and presents it excitedly. Everything about it is crazy. It\\'s about an FBI agent named Johnny Utah trying to catch surfer bank robbers. You throw realism out the window upon seeing the plot summary. I mean, Utah uses his real name undercover (because why not?), falls in love with a girl (predictably), barely hides his profession as an FBI agent, and at one point, he and the main villain know the other\\'s true identity but still act like best buds for no reason.Keanu Reeves is at the top of his stoic, emotionless game. The only actor to ever give poor performances well, Reeves has made a living off of his visible lack of enthusiasm in his roles for years, and it\\'s somehow charming and endearing. He\\'s weirdly perfect as Johnny Utah (the coolest character name ever next to John McClane and Axel Foley), and gives his all in the role. Patrick Swayze is excellent as the villain, and it may be his finest performance. He plays a serious turd in this movie. He\\'s cool in the beginning, but you just totally hate him by the end, which is the hallmark of a good villain. Gary Busey is here too, lending some class and craziness as usual.Point Break is also chock-full of great action sequences. The beach fight was cool, with Reeves and Swayze showing off their moves, and the house raid was also well-done. The car and foot chase scene that everyone talks about is stupidly entertaining and well-shot. The bank shootout and runway shootout were cool, and the plane scene was legit. The final fight was intense and brutal, and very memorable. You know those movie moments where it\\'s totally unrealistic, but it\\'s just awesome and you just smile while watching, regardless of how unbelievable it is? I experienced such a moment during the second skydiving scene. Awesome.Definitely watch this 90s action classic. It has all the slow-mo, intense gunpoint scenes, bloody squibs, and fist fights you could ask for.Also, this movie is not gay. I hate it when people always try to over analyze every male relationship looking for gay subtext. Every decision Keanu made with Bodhi\\'s life was out of friendship and respect. It\\'s not gay. Stop it. Go watch Brokeback Mountain (2005) and shut up.',\n",
       " \"Having served in the Cold War on both a destroyer and on a submarine, I found this story contrasting the tensions between both worlds. The action is shown from the bridge, CIC, and decks of the Greyhound, which BTW is the slang term for destroyers and those who serve on them. Hanks subtly conveys the ache of leaving a loved one behind and her presence with him during the battle. He and his crew feel the presence of the subs stalking the surface ships and the deaths of sailors both above and below the icy water. There is no perfect rendering of combat in film, but the repeated commands and protocols between naval personnel and vessels are accurate enough to convey a sense of proper urgency to the story. Compressing roughly 48 tense hours into a ~2 hour film doesn't give much time to absorb all that's happening, and that's the point. Training and subsequent reactions shape the story in the faces of the bridge crew as they watch the captain and follow his orders which he does not explain. This is about relationships between combatants, among the ships in the convoy, and between U.S. and British allies. This film, The Enemy Below, and Das Boot make a reasonable trilogy for a weekend marathon. Enjoy this story from either a technical or a relational view as you see fit.\",\n",
       " \"This is a movie about the procedure of command. This is an innately more complex task than the more common episodic approach that buries the procedural reality under a mask of plot and character. But this film pulls it off, largely by not shying away from the task.Guess what? Naval warfare, especially the sort of highly asymmetric warfare shown here, doesn't really revolve around the captain demanding more speed while the engineer says she canna take it. If you're looking for a movie that's truly respectful of the labours and sacrifices made in the Battle of the Atlantic, then this is a fitting tribute.Don't expect a character movie, don't expect to spend time below decks exploring the usual stereotypes. This movie is seen through the eyes of the captain, and the captain alone. I can think of very few other films that dare to depict the loneliness of command quite so clearly. There's little time for thought, there's no time to process or even truly grasp the horrors that they encounter (something which forms one of the roots of PTSD). What there is is the fight.The fight is relentless and deeply technical. We've become used to fight scenes carrying a few bits of technical gibberish followed by some visceral and personalised action. There's no gibberish in this film, and the latter consists of the captain cutting his feet on broken glass. The movie, like the mind of the captain, is consumed with the intricate technical and personal demands required to hunt down a submarine at that time. That was clearly the aim here, and the movie has succeeded admirably at showing that particular aspect of this type of warfare. This is not a common way to stage a war movie, but it's worth doing well on a few occasions, and this movie achieves its goal.The reviews show that many come looking for something more conventional, and end up missing the point, which is a shame.\",\n",
       " 'Honestly, I decided to write a review to counter some of the more trivial reviews found in this thread and to try and present an objective perspective of this film.Firstly, the dialogue in this movie is typical for a movie depicting World War II Naval life and is accurate to the time period. Do not watch this film if you expect anything other than period correct Naval terminology or the constant passing of orders between the captain and the crew, as you are not going to be satisfied with this movie. Ninety percent of the dialogue in this movie relates to the business of conducting asymmetrical naval combat in a high-speed situation and is way too short to have a grand introspective or extrospective expose on the psychology of warfare or one\\'s place in the world. Sadly, the short length of this film prevents any adequate amount of time dedicated to forging interesting and dynamic characters or a complex plot with a villain that was somewhat pointless. If anything, the director should have lengthened the film to expound upon the narrative and bring our cautious, somewhat hesitant, captain to life or pick a handful of critical Sailors to develop a relationship with within 80-minute time constraint.Secondly, there are better movies or shows that depict the Battle of the Atlantic which brings me to my second point. If anything; this film should have been broken into a mini-series, like Das Boot or a full feature series like Band of Brothers or The Pacific. Had the directors decided to embark upon that route, we could have had a significantly stronger plot and been able to identify with the characters in a more empathetic way. As a former United States Navy Sailor, I felt right at home with the style, accuracy, and briskness with which the film endeavored to portray. However, I did not find myself overly attached to any of the featured characters. In fact, the film attempts to \"show\" us that we should feel shocked, saddened, or disheartened by the plight of these Sailors, however, without any in-depth character development, I found it difficult for me to feel any more than somewhat saddened, and by the time that I did experience this emotion, the movie moved onto another chaotic event. Reflecting upon the movie now, maybe that is the point of the plot? Maybe, the film tries to showcase that the chaos of battle does not grant us a moment of emotional expression aside from the adrenaline rush of combat or a life-threatening event. In any case, if you are looking for significant character development, and a grander view of the Battle of the Atlantic at large, this is certainly not the film for you.Lastly, I do not, in any capacity, feel like I wasted an hour and half of my life like some of the other viewers felt. For me, it was a nostalgic trip back into an old life that I long forgotten and I enjoyed every minute of this film despite its shortcomings. Has Tom Hanks done better? Certainly. Did I think he did a poor job with this film? Absolutely not. While my main complaint is that this film could have been significantly longer, I am left with a desire to want to explore more in regards to the treacherous Battle of the Atlantic and the men of all nations who participated.Overall - I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, and while I felt that this film could have been produced as its own mini-series in order to develop the plot and the characters better, I thoroughly enjoyed my time, and I am sure I will return to it again in the future.Enjoy!',\n",
